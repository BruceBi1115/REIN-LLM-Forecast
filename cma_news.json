    "content_text": "On June 28, the Flood Control and Drought Relief Command of Rongjiang County Government in Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou, China, issued a notice upgrading the flood control emergency response from level 2 to level 1, requiring all personnel in seven flood-prone areas to evacuate.\nForecasters of the Prefecture Meteorological Observatory monitored rainfall and analyze future weather conditions. Photoed by YANG Changda\nMeteorological departments in Guizhou implemented a “24631” progressive meteorological service mechanism, closely coordinating warning issuance with government emergency responses. This mechanism has provided valuable time for the evacuation and relocation of residents, science-based reservoir management, and the precise deployment of rescue forces.\nThe “24631” progressive meteorological service involves issuing detailed forecasts for heavy rainfall over the next 24 hours at the city, county, and township level in advance, initiating weather consultations every 6 hours, updating short-range forecasts of heavy rainfall for the next 3 hours every 3 hours, and updating short-range forecasts of heavy rainfall for the next 3 hours every hour.\nIn response to this flood, Guizhou Provincial Meteorological Service activated an emergency response at 11:00 on June 24, and the Guizhou Provincial Meteorological Observatory continuously provided rolling updates on major meteorological information. During the peak period of heavy rainfall on June 28, the Observatory provided meteorological services to the rescue operations in Rongjiang County every 3 hours, with updates every hour. The relevant information was directly transmitted to the Emergency Command Centre of Department of Emergency Management of Guizhou Province, providing a basis for decision-making for the flood control coordination work of the Provincial Government.\nQiandongnan Prefectural Meteorological Department issued a weather information report at 15:00 on June 27, forecasting a trend of heavy rainfall. The warning signal was rapidly upgraded: A blue warning for heavy rain across the Prefecture was issued at 17:30 on June 27, upgraded to an orange warning at 07:25 on June 28, and decisively elevated to the highest-level red warning at 09:25. Emergency response measures were simultaneously upgraded: A Level 4 response was initiated at 17:00 on June 27, upgraded to Level 3 at 07:30 on June 28, and further upgraded to Level 1 at 09:50.\nMeteorological offices in counties such as Rongjiang, Danzhai, and Leishan, which were at the core of the heavy rainfall, acted swiftly upon receiving flood warnings and issued 19 heavy rainfall warning signals by the early morning of June 28. Staff from Danzhai and Leishan Meteorological Offices went to the local emergency management bureaus for joint work during the peak period of heavy rainfall, providing precise and timely meteorological service data for frontline rescue and disaster relief efforts. Since June 25, Rongjiang County Meteorological Office has established 3 meteorological service teams responsible for operations, support, and rescue work, respectively, to continuously update warning information, ensure the stable operation of meteorological operational systems, and conduct road clearance and drainage system maintenance.\nIn this response to the rainstorm, the provincial, municipal, and county meteorological departments worked together efficiently, with early warnings closely coordinated with government emergency responses, providing valuable time for personnel evacuation, science-based reservoir management, and the precise deployment of rescue strengths.\nSpecial thanks to YANG Chunzhu, DONG Peiyuan, GONG Ke of meteorological departments of Guizhou\nEditor: JIANG Zhiqing",

    "content_text": "Sand and dust storms (SDS) present a formidable and wide-spread challenge to achieving sustainable development. They have become a serious global concern in recent decades due to their significant impacts on the environment, health, agriculture, livelihoods, and socio-economic well-being. SDS are an essential element of the Earth’s natural bio-chemical cycles, but are also caused in part by human activities, including unsustainable land management and water use. In turn, sand and dust storms contribute to climate change and air pollution.\nJuly 12 marks International Day of Combating Sand and Dust Storms. It is an occasion to reinforce the awareness of SDS prevention and take concerted action worldwide.\nThe China Meteorological Administration (CMA) attaches great importance to conducting the work of Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (BEIJING) for Atmospheric Sand and dust storm forecasting (RSMC-ASDF BEIJING) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and scored a series of fruitful results.\nIn 2025, CMA upgraded its independently developed sand and dust storm numerical weather prediction (NWP) system (hereinafter referred to as the System) to CMA-CW, achieving multiple technological breakthroughs. By introducing 3DVar technology, the System has integrated ground observation and satellite remote sensing data. Driven by the domestically developed CMA-MESO model, it is characterized by horizontal resolution enhanced to 15 km with 31 vertical levels, output at 1-hour interval, and forecasting efficiency up to 7 days.\nThrough the \"China-Japan-Korea + X\" multilateral mechanism, CMA has established a sand and dust storm joint prevention and control system with countries including Mongolia and Kazakhstan. This initiative is driving forward deeper collaboration in data sharing, joint monitoring, forecasting, as well as early warning.\nCMA is also focused on establishing cross-border sand dust and dust monitoring and forecasting for upstream source regions. This enables real-time tracking of sandstorm origins (e.g., the Gobi Desert in Mongolia, deserts in Central Asia) and provides 12-hour warning capabilities.\nIn 2023, CMA and the National Center of Meteorology of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) signed a bilateral intergovernmental Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on meteorological science and technology cooperation, marking the outset of China-UAE collaboration on sand and dust storm disaster prevention into a new phase of cooperation.\nThe National Meteorological Centre (NMC) of CMA has also conducted technical exchanges with its counterpart of UAE in 2025, reaching important consensus on enhancing sand and dust storm monitoring and early warning capacity building, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in the sand and dust storm domain, and others.\nTo enhance China's capabilities in sand and dust storm monitoring, early warning, and ecological governance, NMC and the National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NFGA) have deepened collaboration since 2022. Focusing on core areas including data sharing, technical exchanges, sand and dust storm forecasting/warning, impact assessment, and ecological benefit evaluation of desertification control, both sides jointly conducted field surveys in key sandstorm source regions such as Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. These efforts have enabled the precise identification of source region characteristics, transport patterns, and impact mechanisms, thus effectively advancing sand and dust storm disaster prevention and ecological governance processes.\nIn 2017, CMA was certified as RSMC-ASDF BEIJING, together with WMO Barcelona Dust Regional Center in Spain, becoming 2 dust storm warning and forecasting centres globally.\nSince 2021, CMA has continued to deepen its cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) on sand and dust storm monitoring and early warning, promoting the construction of nodes for the GCC Sand and Dust Storm Warning Advisory and Assessment System (SDS-WAS).\nRSMC-ASDF Beijing has formed a dust meteorological service product system covering Asia, Europe, and Africa through FENGYUN (FY) meteorological satellites data sharing, 3DVar technology, and dust product R&D. It has established a joint sand and dust monitoring mechanism with Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, India, and other main Members of the SDS-WAS. And it has also established a cross-border dust transport pathway database and consistently produces forecasts for total amount of sand and dust, surface dust concentration, the optical thickness at 550nm, and dry (wet) deposition every 3 hours.\nTo further implement the United Nations (UN)' Early Warnings for All (EW4ALL), CMA has developed the Belt and Road sand and dust storm data service platform. By integrating data from multiple satellite sources, such as FY-4 and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), ground observations, and NWP models, the Platform enables real-time monitoring and sharing of dust storm dynamics in source regions such as the Sahara Desert, Central Asia, and the Mongolian Plateau. From March 10 to 11, 2025, a large-scale sandstorm swept across Mongolia and northern China, which was successfully monitored and forecasted by RSMC-ASDF Beijing.\nCMA-CW-v1.0-DUST Surface Dust Concentration Source: RSMC-ASDF Beijing\nIn September, 2025, the 11th Conference of WMO SDS-WAS and International Sandstorm Academic Symposium will be held in Ordos, Inner Mongolia, China.\nSpecial thanks to GUI Hailin with the National Meteorological Centre of CMA\nPlanned by/Editor: LIU Shuqiao, JIANG Zhiqing",

And it has also established a cross-border dust transport pathway database and consistently produces forecasts for total amount of sand and dust, surface dust concentration, the optical thickness at 550nm, and dry (wet) deposition every 3 hours.<br/></p><p style=\"text-indent: 0px; text-align: justify;\">To further implement the United Nations (UN)' Early Warnings for All (EW4ALL), CMA has developed the Belt and Road sand and dust storm data service platform. By integrating data from multiple satellite sources, such as FY-4 and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), ground observations, and NWP models, the Platform enables real-time monitoring and sharing of dust storm dynamics in source regions such as the Sahara Desert, Central Asia, and the Mongolian Plateau. From March 10 to 11, 2025, a large-scale sandstorm swept across Mongolia and northern China, which was successfully monitored and forecasted by RSMC-ASDF Beijing.<br/></p><p style=\"text-indent: 0px; text-align: justify;\"><br/></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><img alt=\"\" data-needdownload=\"true\" data-uploadpic=\"U020250714351830442276.png\" needdownload=\"true\" oldsrc=\"W020250714351859517401.png\" picname=\"123.png\" src=\"./W020250714351859517401.png\" title=\"123.png\"/></p><p style=\"text-indent: 0px; text-align: center;\"><span data-index=\"\" style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\">CMA-CW-v1.0-DUST Surface Dust Concentration Source: RSMC-ASDF Beijing</span></p><p style=\"text-indent: 0px; text-align: justify;\">In September, 2025, the 11th Conference of WMO SDS-WAS and International Sandstorm Academic Symposium will be held in Ordos, Inner Mongolia, China.<br/></p><p style=\"text-indent: 0px; text-align: justify;\"><span data-index=\"\" style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\">Special thanks to GUI Hailin with the National Meteorological Centre of CMA</span></p><p style=\"text-indent: 0px; text-align: justify;\">Planned by/Editor: LIU Shuqiao, JIANG Zhiqing</p></div>\n",

    "content_text": "This year'\ns 4\nth\ntyphoon D\nanas\n(tropical storm scale)\nmade landfall along the coast of Dongtou District, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, around 21:25 on July 8.\nFY-4B/GHI visible-light panchromatic cloud image\nat\naround 07:00 on July 9\nDanas is characterized by wide\n-\nrange influence\nin terms of\nwind and rain, a large amount of rainfall during the\nweather\nprocess, and a long duration on land.\nMeteorological departments of Zhejiang and Fujian have taken preemptive measures to build the first line of defense to guard against the impacts of Danas, and reinforced joint coordination with other departments to tackle Danas in a comprehensive manner. They also fully leveraged early warnings to better tackle the impacts of Danas.\nOn the night of July 8, Typhoon Dan\nas\nmade landfall successively in Dongtou, Wenzhou and Rui'an, bringing wind and rain to many areas in Zhejiang.\nM\neteorological department\ns\nof Zhejiang promptly reported\nthe movement\nand the impact\ns\nof wind and rain\nto the provincial government\n, and\nteamed up\nwith provincial departments such as emergency management, water conservancy, natural resources, culture and tourism, transportation, and agriculture and rural affairs to enhance monitoring, forecasting and early warning services.\nIn response to the upcoming typhoon on July 5, Zhejiang Provincial Meteorological Observatory (hereinafter referred to as the Observatory) and provincial fishery emergency response command center jointly issued the \"Marine Fishery Meteorological Risk Warning\". This is also the first time that Zhejiang Provincial Meteorological Service and the provincial Department of Marine Economic Development  jointly issued a warning to cope with the impacts of Danas.\nThe Observatory also harnessed its independently developed typhoon report form production system to produce and release the \"Typhoon Report Form\" along with its track and related products of wind and rain with one click within 15 minutes, and has guided meteorological departments of cities to issue forecasts and warnings.\nGuided by meteorological warnings, all coastal marine engineering projects in Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo were suspended, and all operating vessels returned to ports for shelter. With peak island tourism season underway, Pingyang County Meteorological\nOffice\nin Wenzhou issued an offshore gale forecast, county-wide refined risk warnings, and decision-making recommendations on July 5.\nBesides, o\nn\nJuly\n6, Nanji Town government, Wenzhou Aojiang Maritime Safety Administration, and Pingyang Communications Investment Group (CIG) Port Company activated contingency plans, organizing safe and orderly evacuation of 1,304 tourists from scenic areas including Nanji Island. All ferry services to Nanji were suspended the following day.\nBesides, in the aftermath of the landfall of Typhoon Danas, it has stagnated with the region of Fujian for over 20 hours, incurring grave windy and rainy weather. Meteorological departments of Fujian deliver progressive meteorological services, and lay a foundation for the typhoon prevention and flood control work.\nFujian\nProvincial Meteorological\nService\npromptly activated the \"1262\" meteorological flood prevention linkage mechanism and\ndelivered progressive\nmeteorological services. It jointly issued risk warning products with the Provincial Department of Natural Resources and Provincial Department of Water Resources.\nConfronted with\ncomplex and\nvolatile\ntyphoon cloud systems,\nFujian\nProvincial Meteorological Observatory has continuously upgraded\nits\nOTS Algorithm, integrating minute-\nscale\nprecipitation and extreme wind data to enhance short-\nrange\nforecasting capabilities for intense rainfall and thunderstorm gales. Within the intelligent grid forecasting platform, a typhoon wind radius impact function has been developed and integrated, delivering more precise information on the scope and intensity of typhoon-induced\ngale\n.\nOn July 8, meteorological observatories across\n5\ncities (districts, counties) in\nFujian\nissued targeted early warnings through the Emergency Warning Information Release System.\nIn face of the 4\nth\ntyphoon of this year, meteorological departments of affected regions have taken active preventive measures, and conducted progressive meteorological services  to ensure the safety of the people and the smooth operation of the economic and social development.\nEditor: LIU Shuqiao",

    "updated": "22-07-2025",
    "source": "China Meteorological News Press",
    "content_text": "China has developed through years of practice an integrated early warning approach: government leadership, early warning first, cross-department collaboration and social engagement.\nAs this year's 6th Typhoon Wipha battered China's southern coast and rainstorm lashed northern regions, China's meteorological departments have activated a nationwide, multi-tiered early warning network.\nGuided by the principle of \"people first, life first\", this mechanism has demonstrated precise forecasting and seamless inter-departmental coordination.\nEarly Warning: Mobilizing joint efforts to build a defense line\nAccording to statistics, meteorological departments of Guangdong haveissued 26 meteorological bulletins tracking Wipha in response to the impacts of it.\nGuangdong Provincial Meteorological Service promptly issued 5,540 town-level warning signals o frainstorm, thunderstorms and gale to the emergency responsible persons at the provincial, municipal, county and town levels, among which 3,200 were for rainstorm. A total of 14 red warning signals of rainstorm and thunderstorms with gale were issued, involving 27 towns and sub-districts. 248 people successfully responded with alert and response mechanism, 59,317 text messages to responsible persons were sent, and 1,211 flash messages were sent.\nOn the evening of July 19, experts from\nGuangdong Provincial\nMeteorological Observatory analyzed the latest developments of typhoon Wipha. Photoed by WANG Tianwei\nTake Xinhui as an example. Before the arrival of Typhoon Wipha, Xinhui District Meteorological Office, Jiangmen, delivered meteorological services at ferry crossings and fishing ports. It promptly released 17 meteorological warning and forecast information through WeChat groups, text messages and other channels, reaching 765 people.\nThe \"31631\" progressive meteorological service mechanism initiated by Guangdong Provincial Meteorological Service\nHainan Provincial Meteorological Service has released 275,600 marine forecasts and alerts to fishing vessels province-wide via the Beidou Navigation Satellite System, and issued 33 emergency warnings to 27,022 registered fishermen through the China 12379 Public Emergency Warning Platform. In total, 394,800 SMS weather alerts were disseminated to the general public.\nOn July 19, in order to effectively respond to Wipha and ensure the safety of fishermen's lives and property, all fishing boats that went out to sea in Changjiang Li Autonomous County, Hainan, have returned to port in an orderly manner to take shelter from the wind. The picture showed fishing boats returning to Haiwei Fishing Port and Xingang to take shelter from the wind. Photoed by LAO Chengxiong\nCross-departmental Coordination: forming unified response\nFrom July 18 to 20, alerts have been sent via 624 million SMS broadcasts across 21 cities, coordinating meteorology, emergency management, maritime, and transport departments, covering 62.4 million people, forging synergy to tackle the adverse impacts of Wipha in Guangdong. According to the meteorological warning, by 02:00 on July 19, all 523 fishing boats operating at sea in Guangdong had returned to port to take shelter from the gale, and all 1,482 personnel working on offshore wind power construction platforms, 9,272 personnel engaged in fish farm farming, and 1,282 personnel working on marine ranches had come ashore for safety. 52 coastal scenic spots were closed.\nOn July 19th, the white typhoon warning signal in Yangjiang, Guangdong was upgraded to blue. The picture shows a large number of fishing boats safely returning to the Zhaopo Fishing Port in Hailing, Yangjiang to take shelter from the wind. Photoed by Liang Jianxin\nIn Hainan, upgraded typhoon alerts triggered synchronized emergency responses. Maritime authorities evacuated 230 vessels and 393 personnel using SMS, social media, and on-site notifications.\nBilateral Collaboration and tech-Powered Defense: joint endeavor to conduct analysis and diagnosis\nAt 20:00 (BST) on July 19, the World Meteorological Centre Beijing and the Vietnam Meteorological and Hydrological Administration activated joint emergency mechanism targeting Typhoon Wipha, exchanging ideas on the forecasts of Wipha's track and impacts in a bid to strengthen the first line of defense against meteorological disasters.\nThe National Meteorological Centre, Guangdong Provincial Meteorological Observatory, and Guangxi Hui Autonomous Region Service and meteorological departments of Vietnam kept close communication in terms of the track, intensity and precipitation of Wipha, and conducted analysis of the impacts of Wipha on northern and central Vietnam after it landed and entered the Beibu Gulf, concerning heavy rain duration, and magnitude, as well as potential flooding, and landslide. This collaboration has enhanced joint defense capabilities against extreme weather. Both sides will hold further conduct consultations as needed for collaborative analysis.\nFurthermore, \"Haian-1\" Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) deployed a total of 34 sondes into Typhoon Wipha's peripheral cloud systems, capturing approximately over 61,000 high vertical-resolution observational profiles.

    "content_text": "Since mid-June, Sichuan\n, China\nhas experienced multiple rounds of widespread heavy rainfall, resulting in secondary disasters such as flash floods, mudslides, and landslides in many areas.\nMeteorological departments of\nSichuan h\nave\nstrengthened monitoring, forecasting, and early warning, using\n\"\n13131\" progressive meteorological service mechanism\n(forecast climate trends and predict severe weather events more than\n1\nweek in advance, forecast the areas and time periods affected by severe weather\n3\ndays in advance, issue severe weather warnings\n1\nday in advance, provide warning information guidance every\n3\nhours, and initiate meteorological risk emergency services\n1\nhour in advance) to support disaster prevention and mitigation in various fields, thereby\ngaining valuable time for the safe evacuation of the public.\nSichuan Province\nKeyword:\nMeteorological Service\nMechanism\nImprove the emergency response coordination mechanism with early warning as the priority. Provincial and 21 city (prefecture) and 137 county (district, city) governments revised their meteorological disaster emergency response plans. Standardize and refine the major disaster weather warning response mechanism. Achieve comprehensive meteorological joint prevention and control, with 14 cities (prefectures) establishing cross-border meteorological joint prevention and control mechanisms with neighboring provinces.\nSignificantly enhanced meteorological monitoring, warning, and service capabilities. The province has established 38 weather radars, 7 vertical observation systems, and 7,023 ground meteorological stations. A forecasting and warning system centered on intelligent grids has been established, with the spatial resolution of 0-24 hour forecasts improved from 5 km to 1 km, 2-hour precipitation forecasts updated every 10 minutes, and warning signals refined to the townships. A primary meteorological disaster warning service platform has been established, providing warning services to nearly 730 million people; a direct, accompanying agricultural meteorological service chain covering key grain, oil, and specialty crops has been established.\nLuzhou in Sichuan Province\nKeyword: Meteorological Service for Shipping\nThe Yangtze River section near Luzhou is a typical mountainous river, characterized by shallow, dangerous, winding, and narrow channels, with swift and turbulent currents. Meteorological conditions have a significant impact on waterborne transportation safety.\nDue to continuous heavy rainfall upstream, the peak water level in the Luzhou section of the Yangtze River reached 8.55 m at midnight on July 1, marking the first major flood peak to pass through the section since the start of the flood season this year.\nBefore the flood peak arrives, at\n16:00\non June 29, Luzhou Meteorological Observatory issued a blue rain warning in advance and disseminated the warning through multiple channels to key departments. Upon receiving the warning, Luzhou Maritime Administration immediately responded by issuing waterborne traffic safety warning information, reminding all vessels and shipping companies to take safety precautions, ultimately achieving “zero incidents and zero accidents” during this flood.\nLuzhou Municipal Meteorological Department has established 17 multi-element automatic meteorological observation stations along the Yangtze River section in Luzhou, enabling the observation of elements such as wind speed, wind direction, visibility, temperature, humidity, air pressure, and precipitation.\nThe surface of “Luzhou Navigation Weather” WeChat mini-program Photoed by JIANG Zhiqing\nMeanwhile, Luzhou Municipal Meteorological Department has continued to deepen its comprehensive cooperation with maritime and navigation departments, jointly developed the “Luzhou Yangtze River Shipping High-Impact Weather Automatic Monitoring and Warning Platform” and the “Luzhou Navigation Weather” WeChat mini-program, driving the intelligent, visual, and automated development of meteorological services.\nYibin in Sichuan Province\nKeyword:\nMeteorological Service\nthrough Digital System\nFrom\n19:00\non July 8 to 12:00 on July 9, Xingwen County\n, Yibin\nexperienced a severe rain\nfall\n. The\nrainfall\nwas intense and affected all 12 townships in the county.\nAt 7:00 on July 9, Xingwen County Flood Control and Drought Relief Command Center activated a Level 4 flood control emergency response based on the rainfall and water conditions, coordinating and mobilizing all available resources to carry out rescue operations.\n“The timely and accurate\nearly\nwarnings played a decisive role in evacuating residents from dangerous areas in advance, thereby securing valuable time for emergency response and rescue efforts,” said\nLIU\nLian, Director of the Yibin\nMunicipal\nFlood Control and Drought Relief Affairs Center. “Without meteorological warning information, disaster prevention and mitigation efforts would be left in a passive situation where we ‘can't see or hear’ the risks.”\nYibin Municipal\nmeteorological\nD\nepartment has also provided\nrelevant departments\nwith\nthe\n“\nD\nigital\nF\norecaster”\n,\nenabling\nearly\nwarning to be transmitted quickly and accurately, significantly improving efficiency and coverage.\nYibin National Sounding Meteorological Observation Station Photoed by JIANG Zhiqing\n“Digital Forecaster” was developed by the Yibin Meteorological Department's “Tritium” scientific research and innovation team. It relies on mainstream social media platforms such as WeChat and QQ to automatically\nsend\nvarious meteorological service products to different regions, departments, and groups, effectively improving the timeliness of information transmission, facilitating rapid response, and providing convenience for decision-making.\nCurrently,\nthe\n“Tritium” scientific research and innovation team is actively exploring the application of cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence\n(AI)\n, focusing on research into\ndetailed\nforecasting services and overcoming key technical challenges in disaster prevention and mitigation.\nZigong in Sichuan Province\nKeyword: Meteorological Service for Agriculture\nRegenerative rice has the characteristics of a short growing period, low cost, and high-quality rice, resulting in significant economic benefits.\nThe safe growing period for it requires accumulated temperature exceeding 4,200 ℃ and a duration of over 185 days.\nRice at the Zigong Regenerative Rice Experimental Base.

Combined, one mu of land can yield over 1,000 yuan!” XU\nJincheng, a large-scale grain farmer\nsaid\n.\nOther cities and counties in Sichuan Province\nKeywords:\nMeteorological Service for\nR\nisk\nA\nvoidance\nFrom July 2 to 5, Pengzhou\n, Chengdu,\nexperienced continuous heavy rainfall. Longmenshan Town saw torrential rain for three consecutive days, with the Hongfangzi monitoring station recording a cumulative precipitation of 387\nmm\n.\nAs early as June 27 and 30, Pengzhou Meteorological\nOffice\nhad issued a warning that “heavy to torrential rain is expected in some areas around July 3.” At\n17:30\non July 2, in collaboration with\nPengzhou\nPlanning and Natural Resources Bureau, a Level 3 meteorological risk warning for geological disasters in high-risk towns was issued\n.\nOn July 3 at\n19\n:15, Pengzhou Meteorological Observatory issued a red warning for heavy rain. Relevant personnel used the Pengzhou Event Response System and other channels to individually notify responsible parties. By\n08:00\non July 5, 1,633 people in Longmenshan Town had been evacuated from areas at risk.\nAt\n17\n:08 on July 2, Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture\nDepartment\nand Lixian County Meteorological\nOffice\nissued a blue rain warning and activated a Level 4 emergency response. As the rain intensified, yellow lightning warning signals and orange rain warning signals were issued in succession, with warning information quickly reaching multiple critical work platforms.\nAt\n0\n6:25, the cumulative rainfall in the valley had reached 41mm. Shortly thereafter, a 45,000\nm³\nmudslide swept down,.\nDue\nto early warnings and evacuations, there were no casualties.\nAt\n23\n:30 on July 2, in the Qiongshan Gorge of Badu Town, Danba County, Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, a mudslide carrying mud, sand, and boulders surged down. However, all villagers of Qiongshan Village had been evacuated to the evacuation site an hour earlier.\nOn July 2 at\n17\n:00, a blue rain warning signal was issued, with 12 townships including Badi Town and Banxianmen Town designated as key areas for prevention. Warning messages were sent to 2,785 recipients, including village officials, geological disaster monitors, and business leaders. At\n19\n:33, Danba County Meteorological\nOffice\nupgraded the warning to an orange rain warning signal.\nAt\n22\n:19, orange\nwarning signal of rainstorm was upgraded to red. “Upon receiving the information, we immediately organized the evacuation of villagers,” said a village official involved in the evacuation.

Through the joint development of early warning systems, we have enhanced the capabilities in disaster prevention and mitigation, as well as serving economic and social development.\" said Mr. Fetene Teshome, Director of EMI.\nHeads of the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) from other developing countries also presented their perspective.\nDuring the keynote speech session, experts from WMO, Indonesia’s Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG), National Meteorological Centre (NMC) of CMA, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and New Development Bank (NDB) delivered reports.\nWMO’s partners in the Early Warnings For All Initiative - the United Nations (UN) Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) – also participated.\nAt the Meteorological Forum,  CMA also unveiled \"Fengyu\",  the world's first full-chain AI forecasting model for space weather.\nTo tackle the impacts of solar storms on global satellite communications, navigation, and critical infrastructure, \"Fengyu\" caters to the demands of future deep space exploration and orbital safety. It breaks through the technological bottlenecks of traditional numerical models in terms of timeliness and efficiency.\nA large group of people, including officials seated in front rows, attend a formal conference in a modern, well-lit auditorium with a blank screen on stage.\nWMO Action\nWMO’s Executive Council in June 2025 agreed on a bold AI Action Plan. This plan seeks to leverage the potential of AI to revolutionize forecasting while upholding the highest scientific and ethical standards and the role of NMHSs as the single authoritative voice on weather, climate, and water-related warnings and services.\nOver 90% of all disasters are weather, climate, and water-related. And yet, as extremes escalate with climate change, many regions still lack access to the basic tools of anticipation.\nWMO is seeking to harness innovation to close these gaps, and is exploring the deployment of AI weather predictions in data sparse areas.\nA new Joint Advisory Group on AI will guide WMO activities on the development and use of AI technologies and will seek to accelerate integration of AI into the WMO infrastructure and research activities.\nThe EC-79 resolution has a targeted plan to develop technical guidelines on the use of AI-based Earth System prediction technologies in the WMO Integrated Processing and Prediction System (WIPPS).  WMO takes an approach to address key issues and challenges through the WIPPS pilot projects and other projects:\nA WIPPS pilot study on global riverine flood prediction products will explore whether global prediction products including those from non-traditional sources can complement existing forecasting capabilities, especially in areas where capacity is limited.\nWMO supported AI pilot projects for flood forecasting in Nigeria, Viet Nam, Uruguay, and Czechia helped detect early signals that could have otherwise been missed.\nWMO is helping Regional Climate Centres in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific apply AI to sub-seasonal forecasting.\nWMO is testing AI powered nowcasting applications alongside with the private sector on three regions such as Africa, Asia and Latin America.\nWMO is working with national partners to improve renewable energy forecasting in Latin America.\nWMO supports the AIM for Scale programme, delivering tailored AI-powered services to smallholder farmers in 30 countries by 2027.\nPeople gather around a digital display featuring a large black sphere with the \"MAZU\" logo at a technology expo, with informational screens and blue lighting in the background.\nOn the other hand, AI tools and innovative technologies have been developed by non-traditional sources, including those in private sector entities and academia. The EC endorsed policy guidance on the contribution of these non-traditional sources, including those using artificial intelligence, to WIPPS, aiming to facilitate their contribution to support public weather, climate, hydrological, marine, and relevant services provided by NMHSs.\n“But we are realistic: AI still faces limitations, especially for local high-impact events. These must be addressed before deployment,” said Celeste Saulo.\n“To that end, we have launched several pilot initiatives—from AI for Nowcasting to tropical cyclone analysis in partnership with our long-standing collaborator the Economic and Social Commission for Asia-Pacific, as well as an intercomparison of AI-powered prediction systems under the WMO Working Group on Numerical Experiments and the AI Weather Quest with the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting,” she said.\nWMO is also working closely with ITU and many other partners within the Global Initiative on Resilience to Natural Hazards through AI Solutions and the AI for EW4All sub-group to harness AI along the whole hydrometeorological value chain and across all EW4All Pillars.\nLooking ahead, WMO will convene its AI Strategic Conference this September in Abu Dhabi, hosted by the National Centre for Meteorology of the United Arab Emirates to explore how public-private-academic collaboration can accelerate the delivery of the transformative potential of AI in advancing weather, climate, water, and environmental prediction services for all across the world.\nIn October, the Extraordinary World Meteorological Congress will chart the course toward AI-integrated global forecasting systems.\nSource: WMO\nEditor: LIU Shuqiao",
