Perhaps no prizes for guessing what might be in a formal submission from the AER? (B) In the media? There’s been a few references in the media, including the following: 1) From the AFR: (a) On Friday, we saw Angela Macdonald-Smith writing ‘Energy grid’s power imbalance could blow out bills, AER warns’ … and the AER even noted this interview here (b) Also on Friday we saw Angela MacDonald-Smith wrote ‘ Power findings show ‘failure of privatisation’: SA energy minister’ , quoting South Australian Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis. 2) In the Australian… (a) Did not see anything? 3) In RenewEconomy: (a) On Friday, we saw Giles Parkinson wrote ‘How big utilities manipulate the energy market, even with a high share of wind and solar’ . 4) In the Guardian … (a) Did not see anything? (C) What about social media? I’ve not really seen anything particularly standing out that I thought we should reference here (at least, at this point).",

    "date": "24-12-2024 04:56:00 PM",
    "content": "Adding one more to the ‘Xmas Reading List*’ was the AEMC, in publishing its Final Determination last Thursday 19th December 2024 for the ‘Integrating price-responsive resources into the NEM’ . * a season-specific variation of the ‘if I had more time here’s something I’d like to read in detail’ List . Here’s the PDF report: … and there is plenty of other material on their sub-site here for Project ERC0352 . (A) Much to read? My vague recollection was that this process that used to be referred to as ‘Scheduled Lite’ (not to be confused with ‘SCADA Lite’ , which is another process) … but it morphed into a longer name to perhaps be a bit less confusing (but I would ask … ‘were price responsive resources not already part of the NEM?’ ). I have not really followed this process closely at all (other than being vaguely aware it was ongoing) so we’ll need to invest some time in the coming weeks and months in order to understand more – because: 1) It might have some direct implications for some of our clients – who are price-responsive resources: (a) including some large energy users who we have been serving in facilitating a form of demand response for many years; (b) but also more recently a range of operators of <5MW supply-side resources that respond to spot prices, but are invisible to the AEMO. 2) But also (more generally) it’s just one more in the growing number of rule changes that impose costs on our business (e.g. in keeping our ez2view software on top of the increasingly complex dispatch process … which our growing client base are increasingly grateful for): (a) Let’s hope that the AEMC’s justification is actually correct this time, and that there is a material benefit in the change (b) But forgive me for being somewhat skeptical, having learnt from experience that: i. Some rule changes prove wildly disappointing to some (or, in our case, moreso a confirmation of the sense up-front that it was going to be disappointing) ii. Whilst at the same time adding to the unfortunately confusing complexity of the NEM … in this case I’m thinking of the Centralised Negawatt Dispatch Mechanism (a.k.a. the WDRM ). (B) Media Release, and Media Coverage Last Thursday to accompany the Final Determination there was a Media Release made by the AEMC ‘Energy market gets clear vision: Reform opens door for all to benefit from virtual power plants’ .. but for me that just raises more questions (as I’d been thinking that VPPs were already participating in some form?!) I have not seen much mention of this in the media (but I’ve not really been looking either): 1) But I did see that Sophie Vorrath had written ‘“Eye glasses for the grid:” New rules pave way for consumer energy to compete with coal and gas’ on Thursday 19th for RenewEconomy. 2) If we belatedly spot anything else (and remember to do so) we might add them in here: (a) On 31st December 2024, Colin Packham wrote ‘Energy regulator tweaks rules to boost household earnings and improve forecasting’ . (C) Key Dates So quickly scanning materials, there seems to be a couple dates highlighted in Table 3 on page 14:",

    "title": "What you might have missed on WattClarity this year: NEM wrapped 2024",
    "date": "24-12-2024 03:59:00 PM",
    "content": "2024 marked our 17 th continuous year of operating WattClarity. Just like the NEM, we achieved numerous milestones and records in 2024, including all-time highs in web traffic, new subscribers, and the number of articles published. With just a week remaining in the calendar year, we’ve so far managed to hit publish on 734 WattClarity articles this year. It’s likely you may have missed a few of these, so here’s my annual wrap-up of our WattClarity coverage to summarise what happened in the NEM in 2024. Source: DALL-E Year in Review January began with a bang. On January 22 nd , the NEM’s most northern region smashed its peak demand record , when market demand in Queensland exceeded 11,000 MW for the first time and surpassed the previous record by nearly 900 MW . The peak demand record coincided with temperatures in the state reaching the mid-to-high 40s . In February , destructive storms in Victoria caused extensive damage to the transmission and distribution network, leading to power outages for hundreds of thousands of customers . Notably, six transmission towers collapsed north of Geelong due to severe winds, and all four units at Loy Yang A Power Station tripped during the incident. In unrelated but similarly devastating news, bushfires broke out a little over a week later, impacting Victoria, Tasmania, and New South Wales . Our forensic analysis suggested that smoke from those bushfires had a material impact on solar irradiance (and hence market demand) in Victoria. Seven transmission towers were destroyed by severe winds in Victoria in February. Compared to the previous month, March was relatively quiet in the NEM. It began with mainstream media headlines surrounding rumours of a possible extension to the life of Eraring Power Station (which was, at the time, scheduled to close in August 2025). On March 25 th , an electrical fire broke out in the switchyard of Torrens Island Power Station , also impacting operations at the Torrens Island BESS . Beginning in early April, the NEM experienced its worst ‘wind drought’ in almost seven years – with South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales particularly affected . In early May, a long run of extremely high spot prices in NSW forced Administered Pricing to come into effect for only the second time in history for the region, this eventually ended roughly one week later . On May 25 th , an official announcement was made by the NSW Government and Origin Energy that Eraring Power Station’s retirement was being pushed back by 2-to-4 years. Meanwhile, the widespread wind drought that dogged the NEM in April continued for much of May, but in a short and unexpected reprieve, the final week of May resulted in the NEM reaching its highest instantaneous wind yield ever . June was a turbulent month. In addition to the ongoing wind drought , drier-than-usual conditions also reduced hydro production, especially in Tasmania. As a result, the state’s Tamar Valley Gas Power Station got its first run in more than 5 years . Meanwhile, a number of compounding issues occurred within the east coast’s gas system – including a depletion of storage levels at Iona UGS, and low production at Longford – this led to the AEMO issuing a rare ‘Gas System Risk or Threat’ notice . The conflation of these factors impacting wind, hydro and gas generation contributed to Q2 electricity prices continuing on a long-term upward trajectory (as shown in the image below). Also in June, the Federal coalition announced a well-publicised pro-nuclear policy shift – and we even posted our very first (and maybe only ever) article on the topic of Nuclear power here on WattClarity . Average prices bounced back higher for four of the five NEM regions in Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023. Source: NEMreview In July , a significant climate-related record was apparently broken, then rescinded, when the ABC and BOM reported that a weather station in Sheffield, Tasmania recorded the highest-ever air pressure reading in Australia. A slight calculation error meant that the actual measurement (1,043.9 hPa) fell just short of the previous record by just 0.5 hPa. Later in July, we noted that the NEM saw a number of rare simultaneous price spikes in all regions . Spring arrived early, with significant curtailment of VRE in the last week of August . We noted that two-thirds of the NEM’s large solar fleet was curtailed on the 24 th of August . Also at the end of August, the AEMO released the 2024 edition of the ESOO with subdued press coverage compared to previous years – although Paul later noted that the order of presented results had changed from previous years. Also of note in August, Callide C4 finally returned to service after a 1,193-day outage following an explosion in the turbine hall in May 2021. Callide C4’s expected return was delayed nine times, and eventually came after a 1,193-day outage. Source: ez2view In the first week of September , the market was briefly suspended in all regions due to IT issues at the AEMO. Paul noted a temporary drop in mainland system frequency coinciding with the market suspension. Also, as is now typical for Spring, curtailment levels reached extremes again with 75% of the large solar fleet curtailed in the middle of Sunday the 22 nd of September. October saw two major electricity system incidents occur within 24 hours. In NSW, seven transmission towers collapsed due to severe winds just south of Broken Hill – leaving the town islanded from the rest of the NEM for approximately two weeks. The next evening, twenty-nine transmission structures were destroyed in South Australia due to thunderstorms and strong winds, and also resulted in one of the state’s largest mines, Olympic Dam, losing power for almost a week . In November , the Federal Government announced a new review into wholesale market reform , led by an independent panel chaired by Tim Nelson. In the last week of that month, supply tightness worries were experienced in NSW due to several power station outages coinciding with heatwave conditions, those conditions culminated on the 27 th of November but thankfully reliability was maintained. A heatwave across the mainland saw temperatures reach 47°C in Victoria for the first time in more than four years. Source: WeatherZone In December , the NEM experienced a surge in market demand, reaching a four-year high of 33,674 MW on December 16 th , driven by extreme temperatures. During this time, temperatures in Victoria notably soared to 47°C for the first time since Black Summer . Meanwhile, in Queensland a major class action against Stanwell and CS Energy was dismissed by a Federal court. The case was the largest attempted class action against a generation owner in the history of the NEM. Later in December, the Federal Government announced 19 successful projects in the latest (and so far largest) round of the Capacity Investment Scheme.

    "title": "Claims of market manipulation against QLD Gencos (Stanwell Corporation and CS Energy) dismissed … part 3",
    "date": "23-12-2024 12:18:00 PM",
    "content": "This guest authored article from James Prest is the third in a series of articles pertaining to the QUD19/2021 QLD Class Action . This article: follows a shorter-form article on LinkedIn that Connor James referenced in his earlier review here . is published on WattClarity (with some small edits) following a request by the author (James Prest), a nd is published in parallel with the publication of ‘Coal-fired generators escape claims of unlawful bidding and market manipulation’ on RenewEconomy. —————– On 4 December, the Federal Court dismissed claims that two Queensland-owned companies, Stanwell and CS Energy, had misused their power in the wholesale electricity market through trading strategies calculated to induce power price spikes. In a complex, drawn-out case that commenced in January 2021, the plaintiffs had argued that the generator companies had engaged in unlawful strategic bidding in the National Electricity Market over the preceding six-year period, to artificially induce higher wholesale prices. Specifically, the claim alleged ‘misuse of market power’ contrary to section 46, Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) in relation to bidding in the Queensland Region of the NEM. However, all of the plaintiffs’ claims of electricity market manipulation in breach of national competition law were rejected. In a written judgement, Justice Derrington observed, ‘engaging in profit-maximising behaviour is not a proscribed purpose.’ [para 759]. The case was led by the Stillwater Pastoral Company on behalf of more than 40,000 Queensland consumers, in Australia’s largest electricity class action to date. A similar action against AGL was lodged in the Federal Court in Sydney in June 2023. That claim was: (a) Described in the article ‘AGL sued for “abuse of market power” in class action led by pub owners’ on RenewEconomy on 5th July 2023; but (b) Dismissed on 15th April 2024, as noted in this ASX & Media Release from AGL Energy . The Federal Court permits a class action (or ‘representative proceeding’) to be filed by one applicant for a group (class) of people where the applicant and class members have similar claims against a respondent. (Here, Stanwell and CS Energy). Broadly, the applicants claimed economic losses from paying retail electricity prices higher than would otherwise have been the case. Specifically, the group claimed they suffered loss by buying electricity during January 2015-January 2021 at inflated retail prices set by reference to market wholesale costs, which were higher due to strategic bidding behaviour of the power companies. At stake were potential civil damages of millions of dollars, and reputational risks for the power companies. On paper, the maximum civil penalties for breaches of Part IV of the Competition Act are $50 million (or potentially even higher, 3 times that value of a ‘reasonably attributable’ benefit wrongfully obtained). As the case was brought privately, it did not involve the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) seeking to enforce competition law or electricity law. In this case the plaintiffs were seeking compensation for economic loss rather than having the AER attempt to persuade the Court to impose a civil fine (or ‘pecuniary penalty’). In a complex judgement full of technical details over 766 paragraphs and 242 pages, Justice Sarah Derrington gave reasons for rejecting claims that Stanwell and CS had breached competition law through wholesale market bidding practices. Ten substantive questions were put forward to be resolved, but all were rejected. The legal prohibition on ‘misuse of market power’ covers several pages of the national competition law. The essence is that a corporation with a substantial degree of power in a market must not take advantage of that power in that market for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor in that market, or similarly preventing entry into that market; or deterring or preventing others from engaging in competitive conduct in that market. The Court outlined the allegation that each of Stanwell and CS Energy contravened the Competition Act, by certain wholesale market bidding practices that were problematic given the fact that the companies already enjoyed ‘advantages, relative to other suppliers of wholesale electricity in or into the QRNEM, that translated to a substantial degree of market power for each of them.’ Enron and Technical Difficulties Readers vaguely familiar with California’s electricity supply crisis of 2000-2001 may recall accounts of Enron’s electricity traders devising numerous strategies with colourful names including ‘Fat Boy’, ‘Ricochet’, ‘Bigfoot’, ‘Black Widow’, and ‘Get Shorty’ (see: LA Times and the book The Smartest Guys in the Room ). Some of these trading strategies involved artificially withholding electricity generation, citing reasons including ‘technical difficulties’ in order to push wholesale prices up. Decades later, there are clearly differences in market structure and rules between California and Australian electricity markets, also decades apart. It is not suggested that CS or Stanwell engaged in the same strategies as Enron. Some of Enron’s trading strategies could never have been attempted here for reasons of geography, market structure and governance. Still, the general point remains one of simple supply and demand economics. If a generator with sizeable market presence can artificially withhold electricity supply, they may be able to influence wholesale market price upwards, up to the limit of any price cap. Australia’s NEM has a legislated price cap, the ‘Market Price Cap’ (which is described, with historical context, on this WattClarity Glossary Page ). However, electricity market manipulation cases are complex and very difficult to prove. In 2011, in the Federal Court, the AER failed to establish allegations against Stanwell of breaches in 2008 of electricity market rules regarding ‘rebidding’ ( [2011] FCA 991 ). The failure of the earlier case may explain why the AER decided to avoid getting involved in this dispute. It is not clear if the AER could have intervened either this class action proceeding (or the one relating to NSW), other than as an amicus curiae or ‘friend of the court’, given that the AER did not suffer economic losses. Early on, the plaintiff’s law firm Piper Alderman decided to seek the assistance of litigation funders LCM Funding Pty Ltd (Litigation Capital Management). In June 2021, five months after the class action commenced, Stanwell reacted by filing a satellite (or collateral) case to challenge LCM’s involvement, and particularly the way that the class action was structured and financed. Those proceedings sought Court orders restraining LCM Funding and Stillwater from undertaking what it alleged amounted to ‘operating an unregistered management investment scheme’ , ‘issuing financial products without an Australian Financial Services Licence’ or ‘aiding and abetting conduct in contravention of the Corporations Act’ . Stanwell’s case was dismissed in the first instance by Justice Beech ( [2021] FCA 1430 ). Stanwell then appealed unsuccessfully to the Full Federal Court ( [2022] FCAFC 103 ) where their arguments were unanimously rejected. Justice Lee observed: ‘The characterisation of litigation funding arrangements as managed investment schemes is a case of placing a square peg into a round hole.’ (at [7]) After these delaying tactics, also including several other interim applications such as a strike out (or no-case) submission and an application for security for costs (that would have required money to be paid into trust in case that the plaintiffs did not succeed), and, the main case finally moved on to a substantial hearing, more than three years after it was initially filed. It was heard over 34 days in Court 1 of the Federal Court in Brisbane between June and August. The plaintiffs (led by Stillwater Pastoral) alleged that between Jan 2015-Jan 2021 Stanwell and CSE engaged in trading strategies of ‘short notice rebidding’. It was also alleged that the strategy relied upon their substantial degree of market power. At the start of her written judgement, Justice Derrington acknowledged that ‘In broad terms, the strategies employed by Stanwell and CS Energy encourage their electricity traders to cause the electricity price to spike when the traders observe certain trends in the course of each Spot Market Trading Day. Those trends include forecast high temperatures, higher than forecast demand, low flow from interstate interconnectors, price volatility, and aggressive bidding by competitor firms.’ [para 1] Background – Rules – Bids Trading in the Wholesale Market is governed by Ch.3 of the National Electricity Rules (NER). The provisions govern the spot market, bidding and dispatch. The spot market exists to balance electricity supply and demand. The outcome of trading in five-minute intervals sets a spot price at each regional node. The Rules require generators to submit dispatch bids to AEMO (the Market Operator) for their scheduled or semi-scheduled generating units for each trading day. At the time of the incidents at issue in the case the market operated on a 30 minute trading interval divided into 5 minute dispatch intervals with the price paid for the trading interval based on the average of the prices at which the market settled in the six dispatch intervals. In October 2021, Five Minute Settlement commenced , following an earlier rule change by the AEMC. Rebidding Rules At the core of the case was consideration of the so-called ‘Rebidding Rules’ (in s.3.8.22). ( Current version ) These Rules govern the practice of generators lodging an initial dispatch bid at one level of capacity and price and subsequently replacing it with a revised bid, prior to the deadline closing bids for that trading interval. Subject to other detail in the Rules, it is permitted for generators to submit a rebid to vary their available capacity, daily energy constraints, dispatch inflexibilities and ramp rates of generating units, scheduled network services and scheduled loads, and to vary what was previously notified in a dispatch offer, a dispatch bid or a previous rebid . The general practice of rebidding is permitted under the Rules, and this was not disputed by the parties to the litigation. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs alleged breaches of the detail of the Rebidding Rules. The judgement spends some time setting out the introduction of a ‘good faith’ requirement in the rebidding rules [at 144-154]. More detailed explanation of rebidding rule: (a) is is given by the AER in its Rebidding and Technical Parameters Guidelines 2024 . (b) and this WattClarity Glossary page about Rebids also provides additional context. The AER Guidelines state: ‘The NEM is a dynamic market, where relevant participants are able to adjust their bids or rebids to reflect changing events, or in response to changing market conditions. The Rules require that if a dispatch bid or previous rebid is amended through a rebid, a brief, verifiable and specific reason must be provided to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). The reason provided will be reviewed by the AER when assessing compliance.’ A brief technical explanation for allowing rebidding is set out: ‘Relevant participants can also limit, amend or rebid on the basis of the physical or technical capabilities of their plant (technical parameters). The ability to rebid in this way is necessary to ensure the plant is operated safely.’ The Rules applying at that time The case involved consideration of the Electricity Rules that applied at the time of the alleged misconduct (between January 2015-January 2021). Given the frequency with which the Rules are amended, this is no easy task. With wry understatement, Her Honour observed ‘Many versions of the NER were in force during the Conduct Period’ . (There were 45 versions of the rules in force, in Versions 47 to 92). At the time of writing, Version 221 is the current version of the Rules . (Tragics wishing to compare the current rules with the old can seek out the Historical Versions ). Short-notice rebidding At the core of the case was whether Stanwell and CS had a strategy of replacing their previous bids at the last minute with the expectation or intention that other market participants would be unable or unlikely to respond competitively, in a practice known as ‘short-notice Rebidding’ . As the Court described it, this has two elements, firstly ‘the placing … of rebids that repriced, to very high prices, volumes of electricity that formerly had been offered at much lower prices – “ economic withholding ” ; and [secondly] ‘the delaying of placing rebids until just before a bidding “window” closed ( gate closure ), such that other Generators had …insufficient opportunity to adjust their own generation rates and rebids in such a way as would have prevented the Respondents from achieving very substantial net revenue gains from their rebidding conduct.’ [Para 5] Amendments had inserted a requirement that generators and market participants must not make a bids or rebid that is false, misleading or likely to mislead. { clause 3.8.22A } Such bids or rebids include those that a generator does not have a genuine intention to honour; or does not have a reasonable basis to make. The Plaintiffs tendered internal strategy documents and PowerPoint presentations from CS and Stanwell in an attempt to prove their case about breaches in particular trading intervals. Their amended claim alleged that ‘Having earlier submitted bids for a TI, Stanwell or CSE then submitted between approximately one minute and 15 minutes before the start of the Targeted Dispatch Interval (TDl), a Short-notice Rebid that shifted capacity from lower price bands to higher price bands (withheld capacity) with the effect of reducing generation capacity offered in one or more price bands that were below the resulting Dispatch Price.’ The Court acknowledged that ‘The documents demonstrate that the strategies developed by Stanwell and CS Energy were directed at attempting to make profit in the summer months, when conditions were ripe to do so: that is, when there was: high demand; price volatility; extreme temperature events forecast; competitor plant outages; interconnector binding and/or other transmission constraints. As has been seen, each of the Sample [trading] Intervals manifest most, if not all, of these characteristics.’ [para 706] Experts in Hot Tubs The Court was assisted in answering the questions by five experts. The plaintiffs engaged Dr Shaun Ledgerwood , Principal of the Brattle Group, Washington DC, who produced four reports for the court. Stanwell engaged Mr. Euan Morton of Synergies Economic Consulting, and Mr. Derek Holt of AlixPartners UK. Other experts were Dr Ian Rose (Ernst & Young) and Daniel Price of Frontier Economics, engaged by CS Energy. The experts gave evidence in two ‘hot tubs’, ( a court practice where several experts give evidence concurrently) after preparation of joint reports in two expert ‘conclaves’. The first conclave focused on economic theory and principles. The second covered the structure and operation of the NEM as applied to the contentious issues (e.g. rebidding). The judgement of Justice Derrington expresses some preference for the evidence of four experts engaged by the power companies to that of Dr Ledgerwood engaged by the plaintiffs. Whilst noting his expertise in relation to competition in power markets in the USA, the Court noted ‘Dr Ledgerwood conceded that, prior to these proceedings, he had had no experience with the operational aspects of the NEM. Despite his obvious diligence in attempting to get across the minutiae of this extremely complex market, he was at a significant disadvantage as compared with Dr Rose and Mr Price, both of whom had been intimately involved with the NEM since its creation.’ [para 34]. At one point the judgement recounts the evidence of Danny Price, ‘when asked about the difference between his opinions and those of Dr Ledgerwood who stated: “It’s not a dispute between me and Dr Ledgerwood. It’s a dispute between the whole National Electricity Market design and the agencies and governments whose market it is and Dr Ledgerwood. All I’m doing is reflecting the design of the market as it has been operating for 30 years. The market Dr Ledgerwood is talking about is not ours.”’ [para 35] What did you do on New Years Eve, Eight Years Ago? Some of the forensic examination of the trading intervals involved revisiting trading bids made previously, with screenshots and trading logs. Stanwell called two of its traders, Mr Adam Branson and Mr Andrew Jenkins, to give evidence. One notable paragraph describes Mr Jenkin’s evidence that he had no recollection of making a particular rebid. Justice Derrington observed ‘That is not surprising – it was on News Years’ Eve almost eight years ago.’ [para 679]. Other interesting parts of the judgement refer to CS Energy and Stanwell’s internal training manuals for new traders. Both manuals discuss of compliance with the ‘good faith’ rule and obligations to document reasons for rebids. Elsewhere the Court dismisses the probative value of a transcript of ‘a recording of a telephone conversation, apparently between two unidentified people, in which one was at pains to emphasise that the conversation not be recorded.’ [para 473]. Justice Derrington concluded this did not assist the Stillwater’s case (for electricity consumers) as ‘no evidence was adduced that the conversation was preceded by any suggestion that either person was contemplating breaching the NER, let alone proposing to engage in Short-notice Rebidding.’ [473] Eventually, after extensive review of trading logs and other detailed data about particular trading intervals, the allegations of short notice rebidding were rejected by the Court. Was Market Power Exercised? Even if allegations of short notice rebidding had been established, the court had to consider whether Stanwell and/or CS Energy took advantage of market power. The applicants alleged that Stanwell and CS engaged in Short-notice Rebidding in reliance on trading strategy with the purpose of deterring or preventing other market participants from engaging in competitive conduct. Thirteen examples of alleged Short-notice Rebidding were advanced in support of the claim. The Court ruled that it was not established that bidding practices had been conducted for the purpose of deterring or preventing others from competing in the market. In brief, the Court held – ‘The strategy is not established’ . Justice Derrington observed [at para 705] ‘There is no dispute that Stanwell and CS Energy are for-profit entities which, as economically rational actors, seek to be profit-maximising.’ Her Honour continued [706] ‘The documents demonstrate that the strategies developed by Stanwell and CS Energy were directed at attempting to make profit in the summer months, when conditions were ripe to do so: that is, when there was: high demand; price volatility; extreme temperature events forecast; competitor plant outages; interconnector binding and/or other transmission constraints. As has been seen, each of the Sample Intervals manifest most, if not all, of these characteristics.’ At [707] Her Honour concluded ‘There was no evidence capable of supporting an inference that Stanwell and CS Energy deliberately delayed making rebids in the manner pleaded by Stillwater.’ The judgement continues: ‘The counterargument advanced by the plaintiffs (Stillwater), was that was not really surprising . It submitted that, given the penalties under the NER for contraventions of the rebidding rules, “more explicit descriptions of the Respondents’ tactics are unlikely to be reduced to writing” . [Para 707] Stillwater pleaded that, because of various “advantages” held by the Respondents (number of generating units, low production costs coupled with generation capacity, ramp rate advantages, status as major suppliers into the NEM), they had either greater ability or incentive, or otherwise less risk, to engage in Short-notice Rebidding. It pleaded that the Short-notice Rebidding was “materially facilitated” by or otherwise undertaken “in reliance on” market power. The Court dismissed the claims as follows ‘I readily accept that Stanwell and CS Energy traders “hoped” that they would be able to cause price spikes over the summer period in accordance with their respective strategies, in order to improve price-volume trade-offs and increase contract prices. That was their purpose in engaging in “late” rebidding. But a hope is not the same as an intention or an expectation. Still less does it equate with a purpose of making it “difficult or impossible” for other Generators to compete in the NEM. Engaging in profit-maximising behaviour is not a proscribed purpose.’ [759] They’re All Doing it Part of the difficulty for the plaintiffs arose from the apparent ubiquity of Short Notice Rebidding practices – as a trading strategy not confined to Stanwell and CS Energy. The judgment notes that ‘Similar conduct was engaged in by almost every other Generator. The evidence showed that, of the eleven Generators that competed against Stanwell and CS Energy (including one another), nine engaged in high-priced rebidding causing price spikes.’ [738] The expert evidence showed that the competitors were also active practitioners of short notice rebidding. The judgment notes that ‘Mr Morton observed that any Short-notice Rebidding was met with a swift and effective competitive response by Stanwell’s competitors. This meant, he opined, “that Stanwell was unable to sustain high prices for sustained periods”. The ability of Stanwell to engage in Short-notice Rebidding was, therefore, unrelated to substantial market power. From this and other evidence, the Court concluded that Stanwell and CS had not prevented other firms from participating in the market. Justice Derrington observed [742] at “[t]he pervasiveness of other Generators’ engagement in the impugned conduct also supports the proposition that the Respondents’ substantial market power did not foreclose firms from the relevant market.’ Implications What are the Implications? Will the decision lead to calls to reform the electricity rules or national competition law? A key policy question going forward is whether rebidding is to be more restricted , and in what circumstances. This issue has been considered at some length on previous occasions. For example, in 2018, former Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg requested AEMC to consider claims made in a Grattan Institute report on ‘gaming’ practices in the wholesale electricity market. In 2018, the AEMC conducted an Assessment of rebidding in the national electricity market . Its analysis held that ‘rebidding is contributing to the delivery of efficient market outcomes but can be a problem where there is a lack of competition between generators.’ Where to from here? In terms of the litigation, further questions remain about whether the plaintiffs will appeal the ruling, and about who will pay costs for this lengthy and complex litigation involving 62 separate pre-trial mentions, interim and administrative hearings prior to the final hearing which ran over 34 separate days with 15 lawyers including 4 KCs and 1 SC. Legal details aside, a key question is whether this case will be considered in the recently launched Review of the NEM. (a) On 26 th November, Energy Minister Chris Bowen’s announced the appointment of an independent panel of experts for a ‘Review of Settings in the NEM’ . (b) On WattClarity it’s been given the name the ‘Nelson Review’ . In particular, the Review has asked for public submissions . It will be interesting to see whether the review members see Terms of Reference to be sufficiently broad to justify revisiting the current rebidding rules to ask whether are fit for purpose, or whether they represent (what some see as) an opportunity to rort the market at the expense of electricity consumers.

    "title": "Final Report from the Select Committee on Energy Planning and Regulation in Australia",
    "date": "23-12-2024 10:36:00 AM",
    "content": "On Friday 20th December 2024 we saw the release of the Final Report from the Select Committee on Energy Planning and Regulation in Australia , which has been run by the Australian Senate in recent months: Adding one more to the ‘Xmas Reading List*’ ! * a season-specific variation of the ‘if I had more time here’s something I’d like to read in detail’ List . This PDF report was linked at this Government page here (readers should note the page links to other materials). (A) Recommendations They are lengthy, by worth copying in here: Recommendation 1 5.7 The committee recommends that the Australian Government request the Productivity Commission undertake an inquiry into the Australian energy network, with particular focus on: (a) the adequacy of the planning regime in delivering economically efficient outcomes, including a proposed economic test as part of, or separate to, the Regulatory Investment Test for Transmission (RIT-T); (b) reviewing all current Actionable Projects within six months to ensure they provide sufficient economic value and are in the public interest; (c) the impact of opportunities in the RIT-T to increase project costs; (d) the apportionment of system charges including whether project overspend risk should be carried by consumers alone; (e) transmission access and pricing reform; (f) reviewing any conflicts of interest, and if required, the development of a plan of divestiture of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) subsidiaries; (g) whether responsibility for planning should be the responsibility of states and territories rather than AEMO; (h) whether conflicts of interest are arising from governments owning energy assets; and (i) undertaking an assessment of the competitive landscape across the National Energy Market (NEM) to determine where more competition can increase economic efficiency. 5.8 The committee also recommends the inquiry also examine whether any of the Productivity Commission’s recommendations made in the 2013 Electricity Network Regulation Inquiry remain outstanding, or require updating. Recommendation 2 5.11 The committee recommends the Energy and Climate Change Ministerial Council (ECMC) develop and publish an updated Strategic Energy Plan . Recommendation 3 5.14 The committee recommends terms of reference for the Australian Government’s recently commissioned National Electricity Market wholesale market settings review to review the governance structures of the market participants including an examination of the responsibilities of AEMO, the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC), Australian Energy Regulator (AER), and the Transmission Network Service Providers in the Integrated System Plan (ISP), RIT-T, and Feedback Loop process. Recommendation 4 5.15 The committee recommends the ECMC consider requesting the Commonwealth Finance Minister make the AEMO a corporate Commonwealth entity through a rule made under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act). Recommendation 5 5.17 The committee recommends the Australian Government publish on the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water’s website relevant information about the role, function, decision-making processes and work program of the Energy and Climate Change Ministerial Council (ECMC) and the Energy Advisory Panel (EAP), including the terms of reference and operating charter of the EAP. Recommendation 6 5.20 The committee recommends the ECMC direct the AEMC to conduct post-implementation reviews on rule changes to determine whether rule changes are effective and operate as intended. These reviews should be published on the AEMC’s website once concluded. Recommendation 7 5.27 The committee recommends the ECMC member ministers table a statement that each Final Integrated System Plan (ISP) meets the National Energy Objectives (NEOs) in their parliament within 30 days of AEMO publishing the Final ISP, starting with the 2026 ISP. Recommendation 8 5.28 The committee recommends the ECMC consider a rule change so AEMO’s directors must sign off on both Draft and Final ISP attesting the plans meet the NEOs. Recommendation 9 5.30 The committee recommends the ECMC consider a rule change to remove AEMO’s power to make projects actionable for the 2026 and 2028 ISP subject to the findings of the Productivity Commission review (i.e., Recommendation 1). Recommendation 10 5.32 The committee recommends the ECMC consider a rule change to ensure the modelling carried out that determines actionable projects include an economic test, labour market impacts, pricing impacts, and productivity impacts, not just a cost-benefit analysis process. Recommendation 11 5.35 The committee recommends the National Electricity Rules (NER) be reviewed to accommodate a rule change that encourages greater contestability and a diversity of providers in the NEM by adopting competitive bidding and recommendations from work carried out by the AEMC in 2022. Recommendation 12 5.37 The committee recommends the AEMO align its modelling approach with open-source software and open data principles . Recommendation 13 5.41 The committee recommends the ECMC consider a rule change to ensure the ISP include the creation of further Candidate Development Paths that incorporate greater use of non-network solutions and non-interconnection versions. Recommendation 14 5.42 The committee recommends the ECMC consider a rule change to amend the ISP methodology to include consideration of additional counterfactuals when undertaking cost benefit analyses to include consideration of non-network solutions including but not limited to all forms of storage, Virtual Transmission Lines (VTL), virtual power plants (VPP) and other consumer energy resources. Recommendation 15 5.43 The committee recommends the ECMC consider a rule change to the Cost Benefit Analysis Guidelines so that costs deemed as ‘sunk costs’ are included in a separate analysis so evidence is clear. Recommendation 16 5.47 The committee recommends the Australian Government adequately resource the implementation of the Community Energy Resources (CER) Roadmap to accelerate CER integration into future ISPs. Recommendation 17 5.54 The committee recommends the ECMC establish a CER consumer advocacy body to assist and enhance the work of Energy Consumers Australia (ECA). Recommendation 18 5.55 The committee recommends the ECMC commission an independent review of the ECA board to ensure that the interests of consumers are best represented by members with appropriate skills and knowledge to do so. Recommendation 19 5.56 The committee recommends the AER examine whether a positive duty of care should be imposed on energy market service providers to ensure appropriate protections are offered to consumers. Recommendation 20 5.57 The committee recommends the ECMC review the National Energy Objectives so that greater weight is given to the long-term interests of consumers. Recommendation 21 5.60 The committee recommends the Australian Government accelerate the establishment of a CER Technical Regulator, and the development of nationally consistent standards and consumer frameworks. Recommendation 22 5.63 The committee recommends the Australian Government undertake a comprehensive review of network charges to ensure that consumers are not being unfairly penalised.

    "title": "Part 2 in a review of bidding, on Monday 16th December 2024 (a focus on VIC Wind Farms)",
    "date": "17-12-2024 08:22:00 PM",
    "content": "We’ve already posted ‘A quick initial review of bids, for Monday 16th December 2024’ early in the morning on Tuesday 17th December 2024. In that article, flagged that amongst other aspects that we’d like to drill further as time permits, were questions raised with respect to Wind Farms in Victoria – not least because of two interest phenomena that (at first glance) appear to have been occurring through the day: 1) It seems highly likely that there was considerable network congestion affecting wind farms in western Victoria (a) With a big clue being the large volume of additional energy bid down at –$1,000/MWh (i.e. light blue, above) that did not receive a Target (b) Which is not a surprise, given what we saw and noted yesterday . 2) Additionally, it appears that (because of high temperature effects, generally poor UIGF or other reasons ) there were one or more Wind Farms that had considerable difficulty following their Target . In this article we’ll peel off another layer or two of the onion, looking specifically at Wind Farms (and only Wind Farms in Victoria – though readers should note that there appear also interesting questions about Wind Farms elsewhere as well). Full Disclosure Let’s start by noting that in early 2024 we (at Global-Roam Pty Ltd* ) contributed a seed investment in another early-stage start-up focused on providing self-forecasts to a growing number of Wind Farms (including some listed below). This investment has followed from our growing interest in helping to make the energy transition actually work, by providing assistance in various ways, as we can. * Global-Roam Pty Ltd is both: (a) the providers of this WattClarity service (b) and developers of the ez2view software (amongst other software products) (c) amongst other initiatives. The fact that we have now made this investment gives us one more reason to take a keen interest in the operations of wind farms . Hence we share some insights with WattClarity readers here today. Walking through all 24 Victorian Wind Farm station s* Continuing to utilise the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view , which we’ve time travelled back to 00:00 on Tuesday morning 17th December 2024 and is looking back 24 hours, we’ll quickly walk through all 24 Wind Farm stations * to quickly ascertain which of these are showing signs of either of the phenomena as above. * noting that there are a few more DUIDs than stations due to stations like Dundonnell and Golden Plains, which have multiple DUIDs in a station. Note that we don’t have time to fully answer (at least at this point) any of the questions we raise in what follows … just aiming to reveal more detail with one more layer of the onion peeled. Stations are in alphabetical order of STATIONID. VIC WF station #1 … Ararat Wind Farm Starting at the top of the alphabet, we have the Ararat Wind Farm: Now, longer term readers here on WattClarity® might remember that Ararat Wind Farm was the focus of the quiz/article ‘Which was that ‘mystery DUID’ that apparently ‘can’t stand the heat’*?’ from June 2019 … 1) so perhaps the high temperature limitations are one factor contributing to the pattern of output through the day: (a) Maxing out at 208MW (at 10:15 NEM time ), below MaxCap; and (b) declining therafter; 2) but there may well be a more common explanation (that being just a general limitation on the wind resource). Also of interest are: 1) the drop in output between 15:00 and 16:00 ( NEM time ) … which (my first guess) may well be due to network congestion. 2) the change in bid bands several times during the day … where again my first guess is due to the operation of constraints. VIC WF station #2 … Bald Hills Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Bald Hills Wind Farm: In this case we see the unit’s Availability up-and-down in a way that seems ‘normal’ for an underlying variable wind resource and (with volume bid at –$110.24 at the RRN): 1) most of this volume consistently dispatched (i.e. implying no congestion effects on this unit); 2) except for two dispatch intervals (13:40 at –$183.01/MWh and 17:10 at –$219.70/MWh) where it appears the bid was ‘out of the money’ and so the unit lost volume for economic reasons. VIC WF station #3 … Berrybank 1 Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Berrybank 1 Wind Farm: With this unit, there are three interesting things we can highlight here: 1) there’s a general pattern of decline in output through the day (which is correlated with the increase in ambient temperature, but that may be independent or interdependent); 2) There’s also a span of time (from morning to until early afternoon) where the unit fairly consistently did not follow its Target . 3) Also we see a period of time where the unit (whilst Available and bid down to -$1,000/MWh at the RRN) appears fully dispatched down to 0MW … probably due to the action of constraints . Time permitting I’d be interested to explore this further (especially with some commonality across the portfolio). VIC WF station #4 … Berrybank 2 Wind Farm Next on the list we have the sibling station, Berrybank 2 Wind Farm: There’s definitely some similarities here between Berrybank 1 and Berrybank 2. VIC WF station #5 … Bulgana Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Bulgana Wind Farm: This unit also displays a sustained period (for a longer period of time, but not as large a relative ‘Dispatch Error’) where its Actual Output is consistently under its Target. VIC WF station #6 … Cherry Tree Hills Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Cherry Tree Wind Farm: In this case, the unit ramps up its output until early afternoon and then holds steady (though not at full capacity) before dropping quite low (including to 0MW) between 21:00 and 21:30 (NEM time). VIC WF station #7 … Crowlands Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Crowlands Wind Farm: This unit sees a number of instances of sharp reductions in output, and then reversals which (in most cases) appear to follow Targets fairly closely. Because the volume is bid down to -$1,000/MWh, one suspects this yo-yo behaviour is the result of constraint action. VIC WF station #8 … Dundonnell Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Dundonnell Wind Farm: Remember that this station contains three separate units … but I don’t see why that should make any difference to the interpretation of this station-level bids chart. In the case of this station we see a few brief periods of 4~6 dispatch intervals where it appeared there was some difficulty in meeting the collective Target across the 3 units. VIC WF station #9 … Elaine Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Elaine Wind Farm: For reasons that have not been explored at this point, this station was not operational throughout the day on Monday 16th December 2024 . VIC WF station #10 … Golden Plains East Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Golden Plains East Wind Farm: Remember this station contains multiple units … and also that it is very much in commissioning. As we can see above, it was unavailable the whole day. VIC WF station #11 … Hawkesdale Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Hawkesdale Wind Farm: This station displayed some commonalities with what happened at Berrybank 1 and Berrybank 2 … which might perhaps be due to common portfolio? VIC WF station #12 … Kiata Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Kiata Wind Farm: We can see that there’s some commonality here with Hawkesdale (though note that Kiata WF is in a different portfolio), specifically with respect to: 1) A contiguous run of dispatch intervals with some difficulty in meeting Target; but also 2) A downward trend of output through the main daylight periods. VIC WF station #13 … Macarthur Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Macarthur Wind Farm: This one is a different case that’s interesting for different reasons … for reasons not explored (though the rebid suggests some physical reason) the unit/station was fully unavailable from around midday. This would be one that I’d be curious to delve into in a subsequent article … time permitting. VIC WF station #14 … Moorabool Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Moorabool Wind Farm: There’s a relatively brief period in the morning where there are sequential Dispatch Error (output under target), but more noticeable is a long period where the unit has bid down at -$1,000/MWh but is still dispatched down considerably (presumably due to congestion, but we’ve not looked further to confirm at this point). VIC WF station #15 … Mortlake South Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Mortlake South Wind Farm: In this view what jumps out to be first is a period of almost 4 hours to 16:00 when the unit is completely unavailable … for reasons we’d like to explore later. VIC WF station #16 … Mt Gellibrand Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Mt Gellibrand Wind Farm: This unit appears to have some limitation on output at ~100MW compared with a MaxCap of 132MW … for reasons we’d like to explore later. VIC WF station #17 … Mt Mercer Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Mt Mercer Wind Farm: This unit sees several periods where it appears to be fully ‘constrained down’ … despite (in the later periods) bidding down to -$1,000/MWh. VIC WF station #18 … Murra Warra 1 Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Murra Warra 1 Wind Farm: The unit sees a long period through most of the afternoon/evening where the output was limited to not much at all. But even in the other periods, the output seems to be limited to a maximum of ~145MW compared to a MaxCap of 225MW. Reasons for both have not been explored at this point. VIC WF station #19 … Murra Warra 2 Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Murra Warra 2 Wind Farm: We can see that this sibling unit operated differently from Murra Warra 1 … perhaps because of the different stakeholders involved. This is one of the wind farms seeing a steady decline in output through the morning and into the afternoon, for reasons not yet explored. VIC WF station #20 … Oaklands Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Oaklands Wind Farm: This is a curious case where the output was limited from ~07:10 … for reasons not explored at this point (but potentially due to constraints). VIC WF station #21 … Ryan Corner Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Ryan Corner Wind Farm: This is another wind farm that shows some similarity to others in the portfolio (Berrybank and Hawkesdale) in that there is: 1) A steady decline in output for a period of time in the morning 2) Plus many instances where the unit is substantially unable to meet its target (with the largest Dispatch Error seeming to have occurred between 13:00 and 14:00). VIC WF station #22 … Salt Creek Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Salt Creek Wind Farm: For this Wind Farm we see: 1) a gradual/steady decline in output through morning and into the early afternoon 2) plus instances of (relatively small) Dispatch Error 3) then more perturbations on output later … perhaps due to the underlying wind resource? VIC WF station #23 … Stockyard Hill Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Stockyard Hill Wind Farm: For reasons not explored at this point, this station seems to be the one with the most consistently full output profile … at least until after 16:00. VIC WF station #24 … Yendon Wind Farm Next on the list we have the Yendon Wind Farm: Unlike the Elaine Wind Farm (above, which was offline for the day), this unit dispatched at close to full output until around 17:00. There are a number of periods highlighted where the unit Actual Output was consistently under its Target. Summing up… Summing up, there appears to be a few different phenomenon represented across the 24 different cases above. Phenomenon #1 … variability of resource … but also some commonality of patterns All of our readers will understand that there’s variability involved in the underlying wind resource, but readers will see from the 24 images above that there are a number of wind farms that exhibited common patterns. One pattern common to a number of the 24 Wind Farm stations was a trend down from morning through until afternoon: 1) which might be just because of a decline in the underlying wind resource, 2) or might have been for other factors (at least in part). Phenomenon #2 … difficulty following Targets (for some Wind Farms) It appears that there were some Wind Farms that had considerable difficulty following their Target . 1) This would have calculated out mathematically as a Dispatch Error 2) But note that the the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view , does not show whether the Semi-Dispatch Cap flag was set during … (a) so we don’t know whether these units would have been classified by AEMO under their Conformance Status process i. we’d need to utilise other widgets (like the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view ) to see this ii. which we might do later in some cases, as a follow-on article (time permitting) iii. albeit that a Semi-Scheduled unit might be not ‘Normal’ only when the SDC Cap is TRUE and the Output is above the Target … whereas in most cases we see the reverse is true. (b) but it might (depending on what the Frequency Indicator was doing during those periods) have contributed to a disadvantageous Causer Pays Factor … which is used, after a lag, in allocating Regulation FCAS costs (at least until FPP begins in mid 2025 ). (c) and perhaps , in some cases, the AER might take an interest (given their clear caution given at the AEMO Intermittent Generation forum at the start of December ). Of the 24 stations above it looks like these stations, in particular, fall into this category: 1) Most of those identified above showed contiguous periods of many dispatch intervals where their output was below Target: (a) Berrybank 1 and Berrybank 2 and Ryan Corner and Hawkesdale all share a common portfolio (so perhaps this is a factor) and all share some similarity of pattern (b) Plus others as well 2) But there was one stations that showed the reverse (i.e. output above Target). There are several reasons why this might have been the case: Possible Factor 1) It might have been because of high temperature effects … Possible Factor 2) It might have been because of a generally imprecise UIGF (Unconstrained Intermittent Generation Forecast) … whether from AWEFS or an individual Self-Forecast (the specific source is not explored in this article). Possible Factor 3) possibly the Availability estimates, and hence Targets were reasonable … but the unit Dispatch Systems had some issues in achieving what should have been possible? Possible Factor 4) and, of course, there may well be other factors as well. It’s likely that (across the Wind Farm fleet noted here) above there are a range of factors at work. We’ll need to follow up with a subsequent article (part 3?) in order to use the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget (or others) in order to see more for this subset of units. Phenomenon #3 … strong Network Congestion (for some Wind Farms) It seems highly likely that there was considerable network congestion affecting wind farms in western Victoria 1) With a big clue being the large volume of additional energy bid down at –$1,000/MWh (i.e. light blue, above) that did not receive a Target 2) Which is not a surprise, given what we saw and noted yesterday . Of the 24 x stations shown above, the following show signs that they were affected by constraints (noting that the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view focuses on the bids that NEMDE considered for dispatch, but not other factors, such as specific constraints). We’ll need to follow up with a subsequent article (part 3?) in order to use the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget (or others) in order to see more for this subset of units. Phenomenon #4 … some Wind Farms off entirely Two Wind Farm stations were off for the entire day (ELAINE and GPWFEAST) whilst other Wind Farms (INSERT HERE) experienced time periods through the afternoon where their Availability (and hence Target) was set to 0MW. We’ll need to follow up with a subsequent article (part 3?) in order to use the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget (or others) in order to see more for this subset of units. Time permitting we might explore more later … but that’s all we have time for in this thread today.",

    "title": "Locations of last week’s CIS winners vs known areas of congestion",
    "date": "17-12-2024 03:52:00 PM",
    "content": "Last week, we reported that the Federal Government announced the list of winners from the latest Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) tender . As I mentioned when reporting the news, it was noteworthy that 11 of the 19 winners were standalone generation projects (i.e. without a co-located battery). This raised some eyebrows in our office, given the major headwinds that have been facing existing projects of this nature for several years, as I recently summarised here . In response to that article, Ben Skinner commented , “It might be interesting to plot these projects on a map also showing known areas of congestion”. Ben’s request made me curious. So without further ado – below, I’ve taken two maps from an article I wrote about economic and network curtailment back in May , and added the locations of the 19 successful projects from last week’s CIS announcement for comparison. The locations and fuel types of last week’s CIS winners vs economic curtailment factors in 2023 for existing generation. Source: GSD2023 Broadly, congestion occurs when parts of the transmission network are overloaded due to a mismatch between supply and demand (specifically, a mismatch between their locational and temporal characteristics). Curtailment is just one measure of congestion, and for large (semi-scheduled) solar and wind farms we categorise curtailment into two forms: Economic Curtailment (a.k.a offloading): a deliberate choice made by a generator to operate below available output. Hence, this type of curtailment is more related to bidding . Network Curtailment: a forced outcome where a generator operates below available output due to a network constraint. Hence, this type of curtailment is more related to constraint equations . Although ‘economic’ curtailment might sound like it has nothing to do with the physical network, it often does because (1) interconnector capacity plays a role in economic curtailment, and (2) bidding behaviour and constraint effects can be intertwined .

    "date": "17-12-2024 01:54:00 PM",
    "content": "For the first time since the fateful Black Summer, the mercury has reached 47°C in Victoria, as an intense heatwave bakes large parts of eastern Australia including a big chunk of our southernmost mainland state. Shortly after 2pm, the mercury peaked at 47.1°C at Walpeup, a tiny town in the Mallee region in the state’s northwest with a population of around 150. As of 3pm Monday (AEDT), temps had reached 44°C or higher at several locations in the Mallee and Wimmera districts including Mildura (45.1°C), Hopetoun Airport (45.4°C), Swan Hill (45°C) and Horsham (44°C). Even Victoria’s southern coastline has not been spared today’s extreme heat, with Warrnambool reaching 41.2°C just after 1pm before rapidly shedding more than 10 degrees within half an hour as a cooler west-southwesterly change pushed through. Image: Forecast maximum temperatures for Victoria and nearby areas on Monday, December 16. Source: Weatherzone The map below shows the forecast maximums for this Monday with pink areas equating to a top of 44°C or higher, and it has proven remarkably accurate. Image: Forecast maximums across Australia on Monday, December 16, 2024. As the map shows, it’s not just Victoria which has seen extreme heat this Monday. Sizzling temps in the vicinity of 45°C up to 3pm AEDT have also been recorded in: Eastern SA (Renmark 46.5°C, Lameroo 44.9°C) Western NSW (Wilcannia 45.3°C, Mulurulu 45.2°C, Ivanhoe 45.2°C) Southwest Qld (Birdsville 45.5°C) Northwest Qld (Urandangi 46°C) Southeastern parts of the NT (Jervois 45.4°C) The extreme heat has been caused by northerly winds circulating around a high pressure system centred over the Tasman Sea. These winds have funnelled hot air from the interior of the continent southwards, and since the weather systems have been relatively slow-moving in recent days, plenty of hot air has been allowed to build up. Image: Synoptic chart for Australia on Monday, December 16, 2024. As we progress through Monday afternoon, the temperature is yet to reach 40°C in Melbourne, with 38.1°C recorded just before 3pm en route to a predicted maximum of 41°C. Geelong reached 40.7°C not long after 2pm. That cooler change that whipped through Warrnambool just after 1pm should reach Melbourne around twilight. Meanwhile the heatwave will continue into Tuesday in eastern NSW, with temps reaching as high as 41°C or 42°C in the outer western suburbs of Sydney and in the towns of the lower Hunter Valley, just west of Newcastle.

    "date": "17-12-2024 11:36:00 AM",
    "content": "Electricity Demand in Victoria on Monday 16th December 2024 reached quite high levels … but they were not ‘all time maximum’ (i.e if looking at ‘Market Demand’ or ‘Grid Demand’ … though Allan points out they may have been, if looking at ‘Underlying Demand’ ) Two of the common measures of demand reached yesterday were as follows: 1) AEMO (and NEMMCO beforehand) has been publishing the ‘TOTAL DEMAND’ metric since the start of the NEM (as it’s a central input into the NEMDE dispatch and price setting process). (a) It’s for that reason that we refer to it as ‘ Market Demand ’ (b) Looking at what happened yesterday, the ‘ Market Demand ’ peaked at 9,887MW in the five-minute dispatch interval ending 17:00 ( NEM time ) 2) AEMO (and NEMMCO beforehand) has also been producing, an ‘after the fact’ calculation of ‘Operational Demand’ as a proxy for the rate of consumption (remembering MW is a rate ) supplied by visible* supply sources on the grid. * i.e. excluding a range of invisible supply sources, with the big one now being rooftop PV. (a) but not back to the start of the NEM, and the only data set we have accessible from the AEMO is of 30-minute cadence and only extends back to December 2014 (i.e. there’s only 10 years of history, whereas the NEM has just clocked over its 26th birthday) (b) Looking at what happened yesterday, the ‘ Operational Demand ’ peaked at 9,851MW in the 30-minute period ending 17:00 ( NEM time ). Opening up the ‘Trends Engine’ within ez2view and querying these two data series back to the start of the NEM, we see the following So the key take-aways for me are: 1) Whilst peak demand levels in Victoria on Monday 16th December 2024 were quite high 2) They are well below the ‘all time maximum levels’ looking back to the start of the NEM, with standouts being: (a) 10,277MW for ‘ Market Demand ’ in January 2014 (b) 10,496MW as highest ever for ‘ Market Demand ’ at 12:35 on 29th January 2009 (a day many will still remember, and which we wrote about ) Note that I’ve also included ‘Demand and Non-Scheduled Generation’ , which is yet one more measure of demand.",

    "title": "Very fast FCAS, 2024 in review",
    "date": "17-12-2024 09:18:00 AM",
    "content": "The very fast FCAS markets (raise and lower) started on 9 October 2023. These markets provide a way for AEMO to procure contingency raise and lower services that can be delivered within 1 second. There is more background to refresh ourselves on what Very Fast FCAS is, and why was it introduced in Very Fast Raise and Lower FCAS markets to start on 9 October 2023 Late in 2023 we looked back on the early days of the two new FCAS markets. https://wattclarity.com.au/articles/2023/12/very-fast-fcas-markets-continue-to-grow/ This article, being one year later, updates the analysis. Availabilities for the Lower 1-second service were enough to do away with the cap In market notice 118145 AEMO announced it would remove the cap on enabled amounts on September 9, 2024. The notice commented that: “The 225 MW cap on dispatch of L1 FCAS sits well above typical dispatch volumes, and no immediate impact is expected from this change.” The removal of the cap is represented by the red line stopping in early September, on the chart. The cap in the Raise 1-second service was progressively raised The cap level is the red line. It is difficult to see in the chart, often obscured by the black dispatch enablement dots. This indicates Raise 1-second enablement was often at the capped level. AEMO conducts regular reviews of the cap levels. The level was was raised to 225 MW on the December 18, 2023. Over 2024 the Raise 1-second cap was increased five times. It is now at 425 MW, as of December 9, 2024. Availability decrease for SIPS is, again, evident We observed this in 2023, and it is evident in 2024. The Victorian Big Battery (VBB) is obliged to reserve much of its capacity for the Victorian System Integrity Protection Scheme (SIPS) between November and March. We can observe an increase in availability at the start of April, and then a comparable reduction at the start of November (to have the capacity reserved for the scheme) in both 1-second markets. Uncapped RAISE1SEC requirements remain high, relative to availability The role of the requirement cap stands remains necessary for the Raise service. Without it, we’d be trying to procure more Raise 1-second FCAS than is available on many occasions. This has been the case since market start. I’d anticipate the need for the cap persists for a while yet. If the trend for increasing capacity and availability continues we may see it lifted late in 2025. AEMO introduced local very fast FCAS requirements for South Australia when in island operation from 1 July 2024. The requirement volumes were uncapped due to current level of participation from VF FCAS providers in SA. On 1 July 2024, contractual arrangements for fast frequency response in South Australia ended. Related to inertia As indicated by the black dots in the chart, there is typically always some level of enablement. Its worth noting that (uncapped) Raise 1-second and Lower 1-second service quantities are determined using an inertia-aware factor that accounts for peak rate-of-change-of-frequency risk. In other words, the required quantities of 1-second FCAS service relates to inertia; as inertia decreases the uncapped FCAS quantities increase. Max capacities of BDUs overlap during transition phase Upon the introduction of bidirectional units there was a period of overlap, different for each battery. The transition of each battery to the new bidirectional unit category has progressively seeped through the fleet. This started mid-July and has led to some temporary duplication in unit capacities in the chart, hence the larger fluctuations post July 2024. Actual usage? Whether the enabled volume has been used/delivered is not clear. Contingency FCAS gets used when a contingency event causes grid frequency to go outside the NOFB but, in a difference to how regulation FCAS is delivered, units enabled for contingency FCAS detect and respond to the frequency disturbance locally. There’s some indication of when contingency FCAS is used, in AEMO’s quarterly monitoring reports . But this in generally contained the section discussing reviewable operating incidents. For now that’s about all we’ve been able to locate publicly. Cumulative cost of enabling the 1 second services Its important to recognise that the 1s markets are complimentary to the 6-second markets. They aren’t intended to directly replace capability in the 6-second or other contingency markets. The 1-second service acts fast to mitigate frequency excursions before the 6-second service kicks in. With this in mind, we present costs of each service. Accumulated over a calendar year. Relative to the other contingency FCAs categories, the cumulative cost of the 1-second Lower service wasn’t high. The cumulative cost for the 1-second Raise service was high. By mid-year, and relative to the other Raise categories, it was looking like the Raise 1-second service would represent the highest cumulative cost in 2024. The 6-second service saw a large jump in October. It’s the spot price times the enablement volume (expressed in MWh), added up. Other notable steps in the cumulative cost chart happen to be covered in the following series’ of articles: Lower 6-second: 13 February 2024 The significant power system event in VIC . 8 May 2024 Price volatility and administered pricing Raise 6-second (and also 60-second): 5 August 2024 Price volatility and generator wobbles 11 October 2024 QLD Price spikes 12 November 2024.

    "title": "A quick initial review of bids, for Monday 16th December 2024",
    "date": "17-12-2024 09:15:00 AM",
    "content": "Monday 16th December 2024 was an interesting day in the NEM for a number of reasons: 1) Early on (in the week prior) there were forecasts of a sizeable amount of load shedding (i.e. forecast LOR3 ) … (a) but they were managed by the deferral of a high-impact network outage that was a primary contributor (b) even without those dire warnings, it remained of interest. 2) High temperatures across a large part of the NEM drove ‘Market Demand’ to its highest point in four years . 3) Those same high temperatures may have had some effects on capability of supply options (remembering that high temperatures affect pretty much all types of plant ) 4) Coupled with this, there was widespread network congestion across western NSW and western VIC . 5) Even with those high temperatures, price outcomes were quite well behaved . So we’ll use the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view to do this quick initial review and then, depending what we see, determine whether we want to invest further time to delve deeper… (A) Bids across the NEM Time-travelling the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view back to 00:00 ( NEM time ) this morning and looking back 24 hours, we see the trended concatenation of all ‘as seen for dispatch’ bids (i.e. taking into account all rebids up to each dispatch interval): Some quick notes: 1) In this case the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget is showing ENERGY commodity … we won’t be looking at any of the FCAS commodities in this article 2) It’s unfiltered … so showing all Scheduled and Semi-Scheduled units 3) We see the bids aggregated into the ‘Default Price Buckets’ which use our commonly used blue, green and red price ranges. … for longer term context, remember that we published this ‘Updated trend of ‘ENERGY’ bids in red, green and blue’ (looking back ~24 years) in April 2024. 4) Note that through all 288 dispatch intervals in the day, we see the black line (which represents aggregate Target for all units in the filter) coincides with volume in the green bands … though shrewd eyes will recognise that some of the prices during this period were above $300/MWh (such as in this snapshot of 17:30 ), which would have been triggered by pink bids. 5) Remember that, since the Implementation of the IESS we show in ez2view all consumption parameters as negative quantities. (a) That’s why there are negative quantities (b) Keen eyes will also see that there’s a second black trend … this time with negative quantities, being With the above background in mind, let’s peel another layer back and look at the two regions of particular interest… (B) Bids in NSW Filtering down to bids just for units in NSW, we see the following: Nothing particular to add here. (B) Bids in VIC Here’s the same sort of view, filtered down to VIC units (and showing VIC spot price): For Victoria, we’ll now peel back another layer of the onion, by filtering down to various fuel types … (B1) VIC Firming Capacity … starting with Firming Capacity (both old and new) … (B1a) VIC Coal Capacity Here’s the coal units: Eight of the ten brown coal units were fully utilised during the afternoon/evening period, especially because of their bids down at –$1,000/MWh at the RRN. The two units offline were: 1) Yallourn unit 4 … on its Major Planned Outage … which is, I think, the last of 4 units to see this Major Planned Outage following the ‘let’s improve the performance’ directive following the poor performance during 2022 . 2) The Loy Yang A2 unit has been offline since 28th November 2024 in a Planned Outage … but we see in ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget (image not shown here) that this outage was originally slated to be finished by 11th December 2024 (i.e. Wednesday last week) … so the outage has been extended for a few days. (B1b) VIC Gas Capacity Flipping the filter to look at VIC gas-fired units: We can see that Aggregate Scheduled Target (for Gas) trends upwards coincident with climbing demand, but driven by more volume offered cheaply. Not illustrated here, but quickly filtering through the gas stations, we see that: 1) Bairnsdale was one station that remained completely undispatched, due to volume still offered above $1,000/MWh at the RRN 2) Jeerlang A had some dispatch, but most volume remained at the Market Price Cap . 3) Valley Point peaker also remained undispatched, with volume bid a few cents below the Market Price Cap . (B1a) VIC Hydro Capacity Aggregate bidding for Victorian hydro capacity shows some complexity, with a diverse range of bid bands used through the day (and even during peak demand times): We see dispatch of hydro units peaked at almost 100% capacity factor during the dispatch intervals around 16:30 (NEM time) when the price was highest. (B1d) VIC BESS Capacity Remember that, since the Implementation of the IESS we show in ez2view all consumption parameters as negative quantities. That’s why this chart looks different than those above: As noted, during the highest priced dispatch interval on the day (16:25 and 16:30), the vast majority of BESS capacity was bid above $300/MWh. A little after that point, volume was offered more cheaply. We presume that this was to conserve the very limited volume of stored energy. (B2) VIC VRE Capacity We’ll flip now to look at the two types of VRE (Variable Renewable Energy): (B2a) VIC Wind Capacity Let’s start with wind: There are several things noted in this image that (time permitting) we’ll drill into further in a subsequent article. For this article well just note: 1) It seems highly likely that there was considerable network congestion affecting wind farms in western Victoria (a) With a big clue being the large volume of additional energy bid down at –$1,000/MWh (i.e. light blue, above) that did not receive a Target (b) Which is not a surprise, given what we saw and noted yesterday . 2) Additionally, it appears that (because of high temperature effects or other reasons ) there were one or more Wind Farms that had considerable difficulty following their Target . (B2b) VIC Large Solar Capacity With Large Solar, we also see similar phenomena : As with wind above, but perhaps separately (and if time permits) we might delve into both lines of questioning.",

(b) at that time the forecast was that it would be 33,718MW in the half-hour ending 18:00 ( NEM time ), (c) so only 44MW lower, and 30 minutes earlier, than forecasts 3 days prior! … take a bow, AEMO operational forecasting! (d) Of course that also still means NEM-wide ‘ Market Demand ’ was actually highest since 31st January 2020 (a very stressful day in the NEM ). Here’s a snapshot from NEMwatch at the 18:10 dispatch interval ( NEM time ), when the NEM-wide ‘ Market Demand ’ was at 33,478MW: From this we can make a number of other observations: 1) Both NSW and VIC region demand are elevated out of the ‘green zone’ (i.e. mid-range compared to historical range) … but neither are sky-high. 2) With respect to IRPM for some ‘ Economic Island s’ we see alerts in the yellow colour range (indicating some moderately tight supply-demand situations). 3) But still price largely behaved themselves through the evening 4) Is that because of a combination of factors, including: (a) interconnector limitations also behaved themselves and were not as severe as they have been on other occasions? (b) the UIGF of 5,439MW of wind power (and 2,499MW at 17:30 of Large Solar) definitely helped to drop price down the bid stack. (c) plus more, no doubt… Earlier this afternoon we wrote about how ‘NEM-wide ‘Market Demand’ is trending above forecast (to 15:45) – in part because of …’ (and Allan helpfully clarified here ). To follow that snapshot from within ez2view , here’s a subsequent view of two different ‘ Forecast Convergence ’ widgets, both focused on NEM-wide ‘ Market Demand ’ to 18:MM – on the left the chart and on the right the grid: We can see that NEM-wide ‘ Market Demand ’ continued to climb earlier than forecast … but we see it also declined earlier than forecast as well.

That article followed Friday’s note that ‘NEM-wide demand on Monday 16th December forecast to be highest in almost 4 years’ . Friday’s article included a long-term trend (spanning almost 17 years) of various measures of NEM-wide demand to show how rarely the ‘ Market Demand ’ has exceeded that level: Most (but perhaps not all) of our readers will understand that: 1) Back in 2008, when the trend chart begins, the amount of contribution from rooftop PV production was negligible across the NEM … what this meant was that the level of ‘ Market Demand ’ at that time equated pretty closely to the level of ‘ Underlying Demand ’ back in 2008 (albeit that ‘Underlying Demand’ was not even a term that was in use way back then). 2) Whereas dial forward to 2024 and the solar rooftop juggernaut has grown* massively: (a) to the point where ‘strong daylight hour’ periods see a large variation between the two terms. (b) re ‘grown * massively’ … with all the upsides and downsides that are part and parcel of this energy source. Given that we’re now somewhat past midday, it might be useful for readers to reflect on the following snapshot from NEMwatch at the 14:00 dispatch interval ( NEM time ): It’s clear to see that (notwithstanding a degree of invisibility in some numbers) the level of underlying demand has been above 38,000MW for some hours in the middle of the day today. We can compare that to the high points for ‘Market Demand’ recorded here (including the ‘highest ever’ back on 29th January 2009 ) to see that ‘Underlying Demand’ has grown markedly over 17 years.",

    "content": "Last Friday afternoon 13th December 2024 we wrote that ‘NEM-wide demand on Monday 16th December forecast to be highest in almost 4 years’ . So I thought this morning we’d use a couple widgets in ez2view to take a look forward to the forecasts for Monday 16th December 2024 late afternoon and evening to see what’s changed … Forecast Demand for this evening Utilising the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view at the 08:15 dispatch interval ( NEM time ) we see that the forecast peak in ‘ Market Demand ’ right across the NEM is still up at 33,653MW for the half-hour ending 18:00 (remembering Tripwire #1 and Tripwire #2 provide some details about what this data is actually representing): Readers should recall that this widget (especially the ‘Grid’ view on the right) is designed so that the user can ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to ‘see that other dimension of time ’. Forecast for Supply Options for this evening Switching the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view at the 08:20 dispatch interval ( NEM time ) to look at Available Generation, we see the following: With respect to the grid view, we’ve highlighted the time range 16:00 to 19:00 which also covers the expected time of peak ‘ Market Demand ’ and we see: 1) Looking left to right, we see that the level of Available Generation declines into the early evening (coincident with the time when ‘Market Demand’ is forecast to ramp up . (a) We can easily understand that part of this decline is due to the effect of sun setting on Large Solar generation sources across the NEM; (b) But we’ll see below that this is not the only reason for the decline : i. there’s one other that we have seen ii. and there may well be more… 2) Looking from bottom to top, we also see that the numbers have also declined in successive forecasts . So clearly, taken together, this evening is really going to be a ‘watch this space closely’. Supply from Large Solar Flipping to look at the UIGF for Large Solar across the NEM (and remembering that the ’U’ stands for unconstrained ) we see the following: Looking in both directions in the grid, we see that: 1) Left to right there is the understandable decline into sunset, as noted above 2) Bottom to top, in this instance, there’s not a market into more recent forecasts (which is a good thing). Supply from Wind Flipping to look at the UIGF for Wind across the NEM (and remembering that the ’U’ stands for unconstrained ) we see the following: In this case here we see: 1) Looking left-to-right we see a sizeable decline of >1,500MW wind capability from 16:00 to 19:00: (a) roughly coincident with when ‘ Market Demand ’ is climbing to its forecast peak (b) that’s obviously unfortunate timing (c) Note that we’ve not looked at the regional mix of this decline (where it occurs might be significant in terms of its impact) 2) Looking bottom-to-top, we thankfully don’t see any LYA2 and CALL_B_1 back online recently In some good news, we saw two coal units come back online over the weekend … albeit not without each experiencing some bumps in their return to service journeys. Using the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget, we take a quick look firstly at Loy Yang A2: Now we look at Callide B1: That’s all for now…",

Here’s a snapshot (at 13:45 NEM time on Friday 13th December) of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view focused on NEM-wide ‘ Market Demand ’ and zoomed into look at peak demand forecast for Monday 16th December: As highlighted there, the peak demand (measured as ‘ Market Demand ’ ) forecast for Monday is 33,718MW in the half-hour ending 18:00 ( NEM time ). To put this in context, here’s an updated view of the long-term trend of monthly peak demand (several measures, but for comparability focus on ‘ Market Demand ’) utilising the ‘Trends Engine’ within ez2view : For those with a licence to the software, click here to open your copy of the above query. As we can see here, if the level of demand turns out to be as high as forecast, then it would have only been eclipsed in only 9 months over the past 17 years … with the most recent higher point being almost 4 years ago. Walking backwards in time we have: 1) January 2020 (almost 4 years ago): … Many will remember 31st January 2020 as a very stressful day in the NEM , where demand peaked at 35,169MW before storms blew over transmission lines and islanded South Australia . 2) January and February 2017 (almost 10 years ago): (a) 34,042MW at 16:45 on 10th February 2017 ; and (b) 34,396MW at 16:50 on 17th January 2017 . 3) Then all the way back in January and February 2011 (almost 16 years ago): (a) 34,870MW at 13:30 on 1st February and then 35,005MW at 15:50 on 2nd February 2011 (b) 34,480MW at 15:25 on 31st January 2011 4) In January 2010 the peak demand was 33,805MW … so line-ball with what’s forecast for next Monday 5) In summer 2008-09 we saw (what’s still) the highest-ever level level of demand: (a) 34,124MW at 15:30 on 5th February, then superseded by 34,818MW at 16:00 on 6th February 2009; (b) 35,879MW at 15:50 on 29th January 2009: i. A day many will still remember, and which we wrote about ii. But note that the 28th January and 30th January were also extreme. 6) In July 2008 (the only winter day that high): … we saw 34,394MW at 18:30 on 28th July 2008.

    "date": "13-12-2024 09:58:00 AM",
    "content": "Earlier this morning, we posted ‘Friday morning forecasts for load shedding (i.e. LOR3) in NSW on Monday 16th and Tuesday 17th December grow more extreme’ and promised to take a look at ‘what’s changed?’. That’s what we’ll do in this article 1) particularly referring back to what we posted ~24 hours ago in ‘A first look into the LOR3 (a.k.a. ‘load shedding’) forecast for NSW on Monday 16th December 2024’ 2) in that article we drew on a number of widgets in ez2view … here we’ll use many of the same widgets to look at what’s changed. LORx forecasts extended to include Tasmania! It was a bit of a surprise this morning to also see MN121823 published shortly (speaking about forecast LOR2 in Tasmania) after the two Market Notices copied into ‘Friday morning forecasts for load shedding (i.e. LOR3) in NSW on Monday 16th and Tuesday 17th December grow more extreme’ : ‘——————————————————————- MARKET NOTICE ——————————————————————- From : AEMO To : NEMITWEB1 Creation Date : 13/12/2024 05:12:23 ——————————————————————- Notice ID : 121823 Notice Type ID : RESERVE NOTICE Notice Type Description : LRC/LOR1/LOR2/LOR3 Issue Date : 13/12/2024 External Reference : STPASA – Forecast Lack Of Reserve Level 2 (LOR2) in the TAS Region on 16/12/2024 ——————————————————————- Reason : AEMO ELECTRICITY MARKET NOTICE AEMO declares a Forecast LOR2 condition under clause 4.8.4(b) of the National Electricity Rules for the TAS region for the following period: [1.] From 1800 hrs 16/12/2024 to 1830 hrs 16/12/2024 . The forecast capacity reserve requirement is 119 MW. The minimum capacity reserve available is 77 MW. AEMO is seeking a market response. AEMO has not yet estimated the latest time it would need to intervene through an AEMO intervention event. Manager NEM Real Time Operations ——————————————————————- END OF REPORT ——————————————————————-’ … I can’t remember (ever?) seeing forecast LOR2 in Tasmania (perhaps one of our WattClarity readers focused on TAS can confirm this for us?) , so that is part of what made it jump out to me! As we see in this snapshot of (three copies of) the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget , : 1) they all line up for Monday 16th December 2024 … with the forecast LOR3 in NSW and the forecast LOR2 in Victoria and TAS: 2) whilst Tuesday 17th December 2024 sees the heat pass out of VIC and TAS and center on NSW. Readers are reminded that this widget allows one to ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to ‘see that other dimension of time ’. Demand forecasts remain high Next, we’ll flip the montage to look at forecasts for ‘ Market Demand ’ for NSW, VIC and NEM-wide: Compared to the forecasts summarised 24 hours ago , we see that… 1) forecast peak ‘ Market Demand ’ for NSW is slightly higher (only a few MW) 2) but compared to the snapshot taken at 10:25 yesterday for forecast NEM-wide demand (which at the time topped out at 33,145MW) we see the snapshot above (peaking at 33,618MW) would be considerably higher . ~600MW drop in Forecast Available Generation Next, we’ll flip the montage to look at forecasts for ‘Available Generation’ in the ST PASA look-ahead for NSW: We’ve highlighted a drop of ~600MW that occurred between the ST PASA runs for 07:00 and 08:00 yesterday. My suspicion is that this is due to the removal of capacity for the BW02 unit, which (readers might recall) we added into yesterday’s article just prior to publication. We see in the ‘Generator Outages’ widget above, filtered for coal units, that the BW02 unit is now expected to be offline until Sunday 22nd December 2024. I’ve not looked into what the reason for the outage is – perhaps not relevant, given it seems certain the unit won’t be back in time for Monday or Tuesday next week. Some improvements for VRE forecasts Next, we’ll take an updated look at forecast UIGF for Solar and then Wind (remembering that capability was looking pretty ordinary 24 hours ago ). Slight improvement in Solar Capability One needs to squint a bit with this view of forecast UIGF for Solar in NSW (at 08:25 NEM time ), but it does look like: 1) Whilst Monday 16th and Tuesday 17th still obviously look poor in capability compared to today (say); 2) There’s been some slight improvement (e.g. forecast slightly less cloud cover?) for Monday and Tuesday afternoons. … and that’s a good thing. Watch this space, for Wind Capability Here’s a similar view of forecast UIGF for Wind in NSW (at 08:25 NEM time ): We see here that ‘out of the blue’ there’s been a burst of stronger wind forecast for NSW from the ST PASA run for 10:00 yesterday … but this currently lies between the two periods of greatest concern. So clearly a ‘watch this space’ . Some movement in network outages … Here’s an updated view of the ‘Constraint Sets’ widget , which provides a Gantt-chart style view of the planned invocation of Constraint Sets . Again we’ve included two copies (top and bottom) with the top view filtered to just the outage-related constraint sets pertaining to the 330kV network feeding in to the Sydney RRN from the southern half of the NSW region: Let’s talk briefly about the two particular constraint sets highlighted. Earlier RTS on the current Line 82 outage Compared to the note ~24 hours ago we see that the line 82 outage (between Liddell and Tomago) has shifted such that it’s now expected to be returned to service on Sunday, rather than Monday morning. Here’s the current view (at 09:30 NEM time ) of the ‘ Constraint Set Details’ widget for the ‘N-LDTM_82’ constraint set: The elephant in the room (the Line 17 outage!) What’s not changed (at least at this point) is the planned invocation of the ‘N-X_AVMA_KCTX’ constraint set . Here’s the current view (at 09:35 NEM time ) of the ‘ Constraint Set Details’ widget for the ‘N-X_AVMA_KCTX’ constraint set: Note that the last time this constraint set was invoked was 17th January 2023, 18th January 2023 and 19th January 2023 . We expect that this outage will be cancelled or deferred … it has just not been yet. Other significant (non coal) Firming Capacity For what it’s worth, here’s another snapshot of the the ‘Generator Outages’ widget (at 08:35 NEM time ) filtered down to show non-coal units in NSW, VIC and QLD that are above 169MW* in Maximum Capacity: * a number partly chosen so all units are visible.

Image: Forecast maximum temperature on Monday, December 16, 2024. Source: Weatherzone. A hot continental air mass will drift over southeastern Australia from this weekend as a stream of northwesterly winds develops ahead of an approaching cold front. This air mass will bring the highest temperatures of the year to much of Vic, including Melbourne. Current forecasts suggest the temperature in Melbourne should reach the low thirties on Sunday before soaring to 40°C on Monday. If it gets this hot, it would be Melbourne’s first 40°C day of 2024. Image: Forecast wind and temperature at 5pm AEDT on Monday, December 16. The heat will be even more intense in northern Vic, with computer models predicting maximums of 45°C in the Mallee on Monday. Victoria hasn’t reached 45°C since 2020. Image: Daily forecast on the Weatherzone app for Mildura, Vic, from Friday December 13 to Wednesday December 18, 2024. Monday’s heat will combine with a surge of northwesterly winds that should get strong enough to cause extreme to locally catastrophic fire danger ratings over central and western Vic on Monday. A blustery southwesterly change will further exacerbate the risk of dangerous fires during the afternoon and evening. Image: Forecast fire behaviour index on Monday afternoon.

    "date": "12-12-2024 03:09:00 PM",
    "content": "Yesterday, the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment, and Water (DCCEEW) announced that 19 projects had been selected from a list of 84 bidders, in the latest round of tenders as part of the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS). The official announcement states: The 19 projects selected as part of this first national tender process, which opened in May, are a mixture of solar and wind generation, and hybrid projects which include a battery on site to ensure Australian homes have the cheapest available power when and where they need it, day or night. Successful projects were chosen from 84 bids proposing to deliver about four and a half times more capacity than what was tendered for, demonstrating that the pipeline of investors wanting to construct and operate cheap, clean, reliable renewable projects in Australia is currently strong. Bids are now coming in for the third and fourth tender rounds of the capacity investment scheme which opened last month. Together they will deliver more than one and a half times more energy than the first tender. The list of successful projects included 5 standalone solar farms, 6 standalone wind farms, 5 solar + BESS co-located projects, and 1 wind + BESS co-located project. Source: DCCEEW When reading the list of winning bidders yesterday, I was somewhat surprised by the high number of standalone projects and their stated locations, given relatively weak market signals in recent years – which I summarised in my article here in October . However, it is worth noting that some of these standalone projects have some approvals in place that give the owner the option to co-locate storage on-site at a later date. In total, the 19 projects were won by 12 developers – with 3 developers winning 3 projects a piece: Elgin Energy (all Solar + BESS), Lightsource BP (x2 standalone solar and x1 Solar + BESS), and Neoen (all standalone wind).

    "title": "A first look into the LOR3 (a.k.a. ‘load shedding’) forecast for NSW on Monday 16th December 2024",
    "date": "12-12-2024 09:42:00 AM",
    "content": "Two things popped into my head in quick succession earlier this morning when I saw the AEMO forecasts for LOR3 (i.e. load shedding ) in NSW for this coming Monday 16th December 2024 : 1) As noted in the article ‘ Surely not again so soon?! …. AEMO forecasts LOR3 (i.e. load shedding) for NSW on Monday 16th December 2024’ , I said as I did a double-take over breakfast. 2) My second thought was that the purpose of these forecasts is to elicit a market response … so here’s hoping that one turns up soon, to avoid the need of AEMO (again) incurring, on behalf of energy users, the additional expense of Reserve Trader . In this article we’ll take a first look at what we can see in the market data, using our ez2view market insights software application: … CAVEAT = done quickly, may be mistakes ! (A) Are the (concerning) forecasts still there? The Market Notice we referenced here was published at 00:42 ( NEM time ) this morning, so it’s reasonable to firstly wonder if these forecasts have persisted over the ~8 hours since that time to the writing of this article. With the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view we can easily see that YES, these forecast load shedding conditions do persist – this snapshot taken at the 08:10 dispatch interval ( NEM time ) this morning: Remember to click on an image for a larger view … and also that you can use this widget to (B) A high-level supply-demand balance Using two copies of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view we then see one of the drivers to the ‘why on Monday?’ question is the relatively high demand forecast for NSW: Looking at the top chart the two key take-aways for readers to understand are: 1) Demand forecasts are such that the ‘ Market Demand ’ level might be ~12,700MW , which: (a) Is obviously higher than the demand for any other day in that 14-day period shown; (b) So is moderately (but not extremely*) high i. * on measured on the same basis, the all-time maximum was 14,649MW some years ago … so Monday might be ~ 2,000MW below the all-time maximum ii. however another useful reference is that a demand level of 12,700MW: 1. would be considerably higher than what was actually seen on 27th November 2024 … 2. Which in and of itself was considerably higher than the 28 days to 26th November, as Dan illustrated here 2) The second key point is that the colour of demand (i.e. in the top rows in the widget) is growing hotter … so forecasts are (currently) heading in the ‘wrong’ direction, if the concern is load shedding. (C) Network limitations Remember that what happened on 27th November 2024 was significantly impacted by network congestion: 1) both acting on the interconnectors (particularly VIC1-NSW1 as illustrated here in ‘The most recent 14 days of data for VIC1-NSW1 ’ view) 2) but also on the ability of generation options south of Sydney to collectively ship their available energy to the Sydney RRN (as Linton illustrated on Monday in ‘Curtailment concerns provide a view of the future’ ). With this in mind, we use the ‘ Constraint Sets ’ widget in ez2view to take a quick look: Note here that there are two copies of this widget above and below in the window, with different time ranges shown in each: 1) In the top widget we use our filter to focus on outage-related constraint sets pertaining to the 330kV network feeding in from southern NSW into the Sydney RRN: (a) Of particular interest is the ‘N-X_AVMA_KCTX’ constraint set … (b) Which we’ve not highlighted before in articles here on WattClarity (c) But pertains to an outage on the ‘ Avon to Macarthur (17) 330kV line and Kemps Creek No.2 or No.3 500/330kV transformer O/S’ . (d) We’ll drill into this one in more detail in a subsequent article (time permitting!), but the key point to understand is that this is a significant outage that would create similar conditions to what was seen on 27th November 2024 . 2) In the bottom widget we have a zoomed in view of all of the constraint sets notionally allocated to QLD and NSW regions … noting that there are a number of other outage related constraint sets expected to run on the Monday 16th December 2024 , so would need to drill in later to see what other effects there may be. (D) Limitations on VRE Using the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view again, we now take a look at projections for UIGF for firstly Solar and then Wind in NSW: In this window we see (bottom widget) that the forecast aggregate unconstrained* solar yield forecast for NSW is poorer on Monday 16th December 2024 than forecast on Saturday 14th December 2024 … although for interest note that Tuesday 17th December 2024 looks set to be even poorer than Monday 16th December. Looking at Wind, we see that the forecast is also that the aggregate unconstrained* wind yield will be pretty ordinary : * Readers should remember that both of these UIGF numbers are unconstrained, so before even considering the impact of congestion (which Linton showed was quite material on 27th November 2024 ). (E) Limitations on Coal units Finally, let’s end with a snapshot of the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view , filtered on coal units and with highlighting drawn around current MT PASA DUID (as at the 08:20 dispatch interval NEM time ): Amongst we see here are: 1) The unplanned outage on ER02 ( which we noted here ) will be continuing through until late next week 2) There’s a forecast that VP5 will be limited to part-load over the coming says, for reasons not explored here 3) With respect to CALL_B_1: (a) It is due back today, but not yet … so watch this space (b) Also note that it needs to be on part-load through Monday 4) GSTONE5 is on unplanned outage 5) KPP_1 is on an unplanned outage. 6) Noteworthy that LYA2 is due back today, but not yet … so watch this space 7) LYA4 is due back on Monday 16th December sometime, so watch that space also! 8) Also note that (not shown above) BW02 has also just come offline as well in the 5-minutes to 08:25, as captured in this ‘Notification’ widget email alert from ez2view . So quite a few coal units to keep an eye out for (F) Other Firming Assets? No time to look at them in this article. Oh my, is this going to be a loooooo……ooooong summer 2024-25 ?",

    "date": "11-12-2024 03:06:00 PM",
    "content": "The intricacies and consequences of generator rebidding strategies in the National Electricity Market ( NEM ) during the typical ‘ hot and sultry’ Queensland summer when many ‘ Queenslanders turn on air-conditioners to make the late afternoon heat tolerable’ were examined by Justice Derrington in the Federal Court decision of Stillwater Pastoral Company Pty Ltd v Stanwell Corporation Ltd [2024] FCA 1382 . The 4 December 2024 decision was published on 9 December 2024 and makes for some interesting reading. Paul’s already started the coverage on WattClarity with ‘Dismissal of the class action against QLD Gencos (Stanwell Corporation and CS Energy) Part 1’ yesterday, including links to the relevant Federal Court pages. The case is noteworthy for a number of reasons, as noted by Dr James Prest [read Dr Prest’s initial analysis on LinkedIn here , and note that he promises more to analysis to come], including that it is Australia’s largest electricity class action to date. The case examines allegations made by Stillwater Pastoral Company as the lead applicant in a class consisting of over 47,000 Queensland electricity consumers (the Applicant ) against both Stanwell Corporation and CS Energy (the Respondents ). The allegations included that the Respondents engaged in conduct that was contrary to section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) ( CCA ). The Applicant’s allegations focused on a number of rebids submitted during 1 January 2012 to 6 June 2017 ( Conduct Period ). To illustrate the conduct that was complained about, a high-level overview of the events of a typical Queensland summer Thursday afternoon (18 February 2016, which Paul has helpfully illustrated here ) was set out by the Court: At 15:00, the 30-minute pre-dispatch price forecast for the Trading Interval (TI) ending at 15:30 was $55.20/MWh, but the next TI ending at 16:00 was forecast to rise significantly to $299.95/MWh. In response, at 15:26, CS Energy rebid 250MW of generation capacity from a price band of $299.95/MWh to $13,800/MWh. This move reduced the amount of cheaper electricity available and forced the market’s dispatch system to source supply from higher-priced bands. In the first Dispatch Interval (DI1 being the D1 ending at 15:35) the price spiked to $12,700.30/MWh. That price was therefore the dispatch price for DI1, a substantial increase from the pre-dispatch forecast of $299.95/MWh. The allegations were essentially that the NEM is a market, that the Respondents had a substantial degree of power in that market, that they took advantage of the market, and that they engaged in conduct (rebidding) for the purpose of deterring or preventing competing Generators from engaging in competitive conduct in the market. The complexity of the proceedings The complexity of the proceedings is evident by the engagement of five expert witnesses who examined the economic theory and principles and structure and operation of the electricity market. There were disagreements on several fronts, including: the manner in which the expert for the Applicant determined which trading intervals to examine and their significance, what the market is, and the consequences of the rebids. The NER and considerations of rebidding Generators and other participants are regulated not only by the CCA but also by the National Electricity Law ( NEL ) and National Electricity Rules (NER) and other instruments. Justice Derrington discussed how the NER, made under the NEL, operate as legally enforceable rules governing the NEM. These rules evolved from the National Electricity Code ( NEC ). Rebidding has been an area of interest to regulators for some time. Prior to the Conduct Period, the ACCC considered proposals to restrict or prohibit certain types of rebidding. Although there were arguments in favour of prohibiting late rebidding to prevent price spikes, these were ultimately not adopted due to concerns that prohibitions would distort the market, reduce efficiency, and potentially increase prices. Instead, the focus fell on a “good faith” obligation for bidding and rebidding and later, more stringent conditions to ensure that rebids were not false or misleading. In its 2002 determination , the ACCC stated that ‘ [r]ebidding is a key element of the market design because it allows the market to balance supply and demand efficiently to ensure demand is met by efficiently priced supply .’ Throughout the Conduct Period, the NER permitted rebidding. The Court examined the evolving rules that initially required rebids to be made in “good faith” (i.e., reflecting a genuine intention to honour the bid unless circumstances changed). Amendments effective from July 2016 (stemming from this AEMC Final Determination on 10 th December 2015 ) went further, prohibiting offers, bids, and rebids that were false or misleading and requiring that any late rebids (those made close to the start of a trading interval) be accompanied by a contemporaneous record explaining the material conditions and circumstances that prompted the change. Justice Derrington noted that [para 148] a breach of section 46 of the CCA does not depend on breach of the NER however understanding the relevant provision of the NER provided useful regulatory context. Misuse of market power Section 46 of the CCA addresses the misuse of market power by corporations (the ACCC published these ‘Guidelines on misuse of market power’ in August 2018). It states that a corporation with a substantial degree of power in a market must not engage in conduct that has the purpose, or has or is likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in that market or any other market in which the corporation or a related body corporate supplies or acquires goods or services. Section 46 requires a Court to answer four questions [para 165]: First, what was the relevant market in which the conduct occurred? Secondly, did the alleged contravenor have a substantial degree of market power , in other words, was there an absence of a sufficient level of competition to constrain it from engaging in the conduct? Thirdly, did the alleged contravenor take advantage of that market power? Fourthly, did the alleged contravenor engage in the conduct for one of the prescribed purposes ; in this case, for the purpose of deterring or preventing competing Generators from engaging in competitive conduct in the market? So, below, we’ll examine what Justice Derrington concluded with respect to each of those four questions: Q1) What market? A central issue in the proceedings was identifying the relevant market for the purposes of section 46 of the CCA. Expert witnesses’ views differed on how broadly the relevant market should be defined. The Applicant’s expert initially suggested that the market could be viewed as separate for each dispatch interval during which Queensland effectively became ‘price separated’ from New South Wales due to binding interconnectors. In contrast, another expert considered that the relevant market was at least as broad as the Queensland Region of NEM ( QRNEM ) plus the imports from New South Wales. Yet another expert went further, including not only the spot market for wholesale electricity but also the contract markets, behind-the-meter generation, and demand management responses across the entire NEM. Justice Derrington reviewed well-established legal principles for defining a market. Courts in Australia consider the product, functional, geographic, and temporal dimensions. A market definition should not be artificial or narrow; it should reflect actual and potential substitution possibilities, both in terms of supply (i.e., how easily producers can shift production) and demand (i.e., how buyers might switch sources). Market definition is a purposive exercise aimed at facilitating the correct analysis of competitive constraints and market power. Applying these principles, Justice Derrington rejected a narrow, transient definition of the market focused solely on brief periods when interconnectors were constrained, causing price separation. Instead, the Court endorsed a more stable and realistic viewpoint. Justice Derrington concluded that the relevant market was the wholesale supply of electricity to the QRNEM, including inflows from outside Queensland. While acknowledging that other features—such as contract markets and behind-the-meter generation—are important factors in understanding overall competitiveness, these considerations did not alter the fundamental definition of the market for this case. Q2) Did the Respondents have a substantial degree of market power in the market? The Applicant’s case started to fall apart when the Court considered whether the Respondents had a substantial degree of market power in the market. Market power is the ability to profitably raise prices above the competitive level for a meaningful period . Under Australian competition law, as established by cases such as Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd [1989] HCA 6; 167 CLR 177, substantial market power must be more than fleeting; it requires a capacity to set prices persistently above costs without rivals taking away customers, or to otherwise act in ways unconstrained by competitive forces. The Applicant sought to characterise the Respondents as holding such power by pointing to price spikes resulting from short-notice rebids. However, the Court noted that occasional, transient price spikes are not necessarily evidence of substantial market power. In the NEM’s “energy-only” design, short-term price spikes can be a normal feature, allowing recovery of fixed costs and balancing supply and demand. Experts for the Respondents drew attention to market events that occurred during the Conduct Period including the negative trend in demand and energy from 2010 to 2015, the introduction of the Queensland Gas Electricity Certificate scheme in January 2005, and the Carbon Tax and its effect from 1 July 2012 to 1 July 2014. Also noted was the mothballing (temporary closure) of coal-fired power stations including 680MW from Queensland between 2012 and 2013. Experts’ Approaches to Assessing Market Power The Applicant’s expert put forward a definition of market power that, amongst other things, focused on the Respondents’ alleged ability to cause price elevations in brief intervals. The expert also considered the use of proxies such as interconnector constraints, “pivotal supplier” tests, and comparisons of ramp rates to argue that Stanwell and CS Energy could raise prices in a manner contrary to section 46. The Court was not convinced, with Justice Derrington finding: None of these proxies was particularly compelling and often made little sense in the context of the practical operation of the NEM. In contrast, other expert witnesses emphasised that assessing substantial market power typically involves comparing long-run prices to long-run marginal costs ( LRMC ). Their analysis indicated that neither Stanwell nor CS Energy consistently exercised power to push prices above competitive levels in a durable way. Constraints on Alleged Market Power The Court noted that Stanwell and CS Energy faced multiple competitive and regulatory constraints. There were no significant barriers to entry preventing new capacity from entering the NEM if sustained high prices invited entry. Various operational uncertainties, contract positions, and regulatory oversight also limited the Respondents’ abilities to exploit short-lived market conditions repeatedly or profitably in the long run. While the Applicant argued that Stanwell and CS Energy’s size and dispatch volumes gave them an advantage in raising prices without risking large losses, the Court found that other Generators frequently engaged in similar rebidding, and in many instances smaller Generators triggered price spikes more often than Stanwell. The scarcity of successful price spikes attributable to Stanwell and CS Energy was a key factor leading the Court to conclude that these episodes did not amount to substantial market power. The Court concluded that neither Stanwell nor CS Energy had a substantial degree of market power under section 46(1) (or 46(2)) of the CCA during the Conduct Period. Q3) Did the Respondents Take Advantage of Substantial Market Power? Assuming, hypothetically, that Stanwell and CS Energy had such power (which the Court found they did not!), the Applicant contended that the Respondents took advantage of it to engage in short-notice rebidding. The Applicant argued that the Respondents, due to their size, generation capacity, and operational characteristics, had advantages that allowed them to engage in short-notice rebidding that was “materially facilitated” by market power. Stillwater pleaded that the Respondents’ short-notice rebidding was either undertaken “in reliance on” market power or made “materially facilitated” by it. In examining this question, the Court considered the meaning of “take advantage of market power” under section 46. It noted that “taking advantage” of market power does not require wrongdoing beyond using that market power. Factors listed in section 46(6A), including whether the conduct was materially facilitated by or engaged in reliance on substantial market power, were examined. The evidence did not show that the Respondents’ conduct depended on substantial market power. Other, smaller Generators were shown to engage in similar short-notice rebidding and sometimes triggered price spikes. The presence of multiple other Generators who could and did engage in like conduct suggested that such rebidding was not uniquely enabled by any substantial market power. The Court observed that if a firm without substantial market power could engage in similar conduct, it cannot be said that the firm with alleged market power was “taking advantage” of that power. As stated at [741], “it is the antithesis of substantial market power that an entity said to have it is unable to exercise it to its own advantage … as much as its smaller competitors.” Because the same behavior occurred across the market, the Court concluded that the Respondents’ conduct was not reliant on substantial market power. The Court also noted there was no evidence that this conduct foreclosed or deterred competitors. There were no significant barriers to other Generators participating in the market. Moreover, there was no indication that the Respondents engaged in rebidding without legitimate business reasons. The Court found that striving to maximise returns in an energy-only market, within the rules, was a rational commercial strategy rather than evidence of using market power for a prohibited purpose. As described at [746]-[747], “The evidence does not establish that either Stanwell or CS Energy took advantage of any market power… Even if I had been satisfied that Stanwell and CS Energy had substantial power in the Market and had engaged in Short-notice Rebidding, Stanwell and CS Energy…did not take advantage of their market power.” Q4) Was the behaviour for a prescribed purpose? Because the Court concluded there was no taking advantage of substantial market power, it did not need to answer whether the Respondents had engaged in conduct to deter or prevent competitors from undertaking competitive conduct. Still, it observed that no evidence supported the proposition that short-notice rebidding was aimed at deterring competitive responses or that such conduct had that effect. Further analysis This summary of the decision, although lengthy, only touches on selected aspects of the case. It does not fully engage with the expert reports, all of the parties’ submissions, or the Court’s detailed reasoning. While the Applicant did not succeed, this outcome does not necessarily mean that certain bidding strategies can be pursued without risk. The Court’s findings were based on specific circumstances involving Stanwell and CS Energy during particular periods and the pleadings of the Applicant. Generators and other industry participants would be well advised to seek legal advice on the decision’s relevance to their operations. Some observers will see the judgment as highlighting potential regulatory gaps, prompting discussions on whether the regulatory framework requires change. It is also noteworthy that in 2011, in separate proceedings before the Federal Court, the Australian Energy Regulator was unsuccessful in establishing that Stanwell had breached electricity market rebidding rules during 2008 ([2011] FCA 991). Ultimately, however, the Applicant in this case simply failed to demonstrate that the Respondents’ conduct contravened the relevant section of the CCA.

    "title": "Submissions open today for the ‘Nelson Review’ into the NEM",
    "date": "11-12-2024 11:01:00 AM",
    "content": "Two weeks ago, Chris Bowen announced a new independent panel led by Tim Nelson, to review wholesale market settings and provide reform recommendations . The panel have today released the Terms of Reference and Release Package and opened submissions from the public. Submissions will be accepted until February 14 th 2025. Final recommendations from the review are expected in late 2025. The initial consultation overview page states: Through the stakeholder engagement process the Panel is seeking the insights of states and territories, market bodies, generators, retailers, investors and electricity consumers (industrial, large and small-scale) across the NEM and beyond. The Review will consider perspectives from other markets overseas, academic and policy literature, micro-economic and social-policy principles and other industries with similar long-lived, capital-intensive investment features. The Review will also consider previous and current work of governments and the market bodies. The Review is expected to undertake modelling and other analysis to provide a basis for comparison between different policy options and we encourage stakeholders to share their insights and knowledge to inform this process. The document states that the panel is specifically seeking feedback from market stakeholders on five topics: Investment incentives Consumer interaction with the wholesale market Changing nature of spot electricity prices Essential system services Enhancing competition Within these five topics, the document from the panel posed several questions to potential respondents. The full list of these questions is below: How might the NEM wholesale market and derivate markets most efficiently evolve to provide signals for investment in firmed, renewable generation and storage capacity? Is there a role for certificated schemes to promote investment in firmed, renewable generation and storage and what might these look like? Could the Retailer Reliability Obligation (RRO) play a role to incentivise new investment if it was expanded in the future? Could other capacity mechanisms efficiently attract investment in firmed, renewable generation and storage capacity? How can markets ensure we have sufficient capacity in place when and where we need it before existing resources retire? How do the market settings preferred by stakeholders provide sufficient confidence to consumers and governments that capacity will be delivered? How can the NEM wholesale market and any other markets work in tandem to ensure we have appropriate signals for the right type of resources in place when and where we need it? How can these market settings facilitate emissions reduction in line with the National Electricity Objective and Australia’s international commitments? What can be done to facilitate better interaction between the demand-side, the spot market and any existing or future financial markets? How might the NEM wholesale market best allow for customers to engage in the market to benefit from their investment in CER, while allowing for different consumers to choose how they engage and continuing to recognise electricity is an essential service with associated accessibility issues for many consumers? How will prices at different times of the day and year change and evolve with the move towards firmed, renewable energy generation and storage? How might the NEM wholesale market and derivative markets allow market participants to most effectively respond to fluctuating prices and manage price risk? What new markets and other measures might ensure they are provided? Which entities are best placed to determine what is needed, where and when? To maintain system security and strength, how can we ensure these services are procured before existing plant retires? How can we promote innovation in how these services can be provided at lowest cost? How might we harness the larger number of small resources and growing participation to ensure all markets (i.e. spot, forwards, retail etc) are increasingly competitive?",

One thing that popped to my attention on Wednesday 4th December 2024 was the article ‘Class action against Queensland’s government-owned electricity generators dismissed’ by Aaron Kelly of the ABC. 1) But I did not really have much chance to (even start to) look at this until several days later … and all I really have are questions, at this time. 2) I did not really see much other reporting about this … (a) Other than here in the Courier Mail and here in Lawyerly … but I can’t access either of them, so not sure if of any value (though I did not the title at Lawyerly was ‘ Judge boots Queensland energy class action, says ‘profit maximisation’ not unlawful ‘ ) (b) But if readers have seen other reporting or (useful!) commentary, it would be appreciated if you could link to it in comments below please? (A) What was the genesis of the Class Action? The parties who initiated the class action (including Piper Alderman and LCM Finance ) have put together a website at https://www.qldenergyclassaction.com.au/ with some explanatory material that might be useful for those seeking to understand why such claims were made. As at this morning (Tuesday 10th December 2024) this is how the website currently looks … but, given the result of the action in the Federal Court, I’m not sure how long this material might continue to remain in place? What might be of particular use to some readers is the ‘Resources’ page that contains a list of, and links to, other documents that were used to support their case: At the top of the list of Resources is their 5-page ‘Claim Summary’ , which is here: For those not so familiar with the NEM, useful to highlight that the time-span nominated in the Claim (i.e. 2013 to 2019): 1) Spans a time when the structure of the QLD GenCos was relatively stable : (a) It commences after the 3-into-2 merger (of July 2011) that created the ‘current’ form of Stanwell Corporation and CS Energy; (b) But crosses over briefly with the creation of CleanCo in December 2018 (albeit that CleanCo was not fully up and running until sometime later). 2) But included some of the 24-month long period of the Gillard Government’s ‘Carbon Tax’ (i.e. 1st July 2012 to 30th June 2014). 3) This all happened before 5-Minute Settlement . (B) About the court case? We looked at this some time ago (earlier in the Court Process) and had a difficult time finding the place to start looking … so, partly for our own future reference, we note that: It was heard in the Federal Court of Australia, Queensland Registry It was given a docket number QUD19/2021 It had a title that seemed confusing to me at the start ‘STILLWATER PASTORAL COMPANY PTY LTD ACN 101 400 668 v STANWELL CORPORATION LTD ACN 078 848 674 & ANOR’ Filed on 20th January 2021 … with the main place to start looking being this root page here : In terms of linked documents, the two at the top will be of most interest to most readers here, I would think? I’m not a lawyer (clear caveat … I’m just trying to understand, here, and may well be wrong in my interpretation), but ‘The Order’ seems to pretty clear: At the bottom of that short 3-page document it notes: ‘The proceeding be dismissed . The matter be adjourned to a date in March 2025 for the determination of costs.’ In contrast to the brevity of the Order, the Judgement goes on in seemingly endless scroll (the Word document that’s linked there is 198 pages long): (C) A few questions/observations … including ‘What it all means?’ Given the recency, and the length (and other busyness) I’ve only had a chance to give the Judgement a cursory scan. I’d like to be able to say ‘when I have time, I’ll look in more detail’ … but I recognise that this is unlikely to happen. So, for what it’s worth, here’s a brain dump of initial impressions and questions: (C1) Approach My initial understanding (based on 2nd and 3rd hand accounts earlier in the Class Action process) was that the approach was to be not so much looking at NEM Rules but instead looking into broader competition law. However in the Judgement I saw plenty of reference to the NEM Rules and bidding process (and in particular to ‘short notice rebidding’ ), so not sure what changed there (if anything)? (C2) Distilling down to a few Trading Intervals In the Judgement it notes: 1) There were 571,392 DIs during the period from 1 January 2012 to 6 June 2017 (noting that this was the point from which the QLD Government’s ‘don’t make too much profit’ direction was made to the GenCos ). 2) From this there were 351 Affected Trading Intervals (ATIs) identified … ‘The Sample Intervals are a subset of 353 ATIs, identified by Dr Ledgerwood, during which the impugned conduct was said both to have taken place and to have had a quantum effect on the Spot Price in the relevant ATI’ 3) From that selected list of 351 ATIs, the Judgement highlights that 13 were selected (p12/247): ‘In broad terms, the Court was asked to interrogate 13 examples, similar in many respects to the rebid scenario just described, and which are referred to as Affected Trading Intervals #1 – #13 ( ATI s). The 13 ATIs (together, the Sample Intervals ) were, it seems, chosen by Stillwater’s expert, Dr Shaun Ledgerwood . ’ If time permitted, I’d like to find that list of 351 (and then 13) Trading Intervals to satisfy my own curiosity. (C3) A focus on ‘Short Notice Rebidding’ The Judgement also notes (p12/247): ‘Stillwater alleges that, during the Conduct Period, the Respondents took advantage of that market power, for the purpose of deterring or preventing other Generators from engaging in competitive conduct, by their conduct comprised of two elements, which is described as Short-notice Rebidding . The two elements said to comprise Short-notice Rebidding are: (i) the placing by the Respondents of rebids that repriced, to very high prices, volumes of electricity that formerly had been offered at much lower prices – “ economic withholding ”; and (ii) the delaying of placing rebids until just before a bidding “window” closed ( gate closure – on average 67 seconds prior to commencement of the next DI), such that other Generators had either no opportunity to respond, or insufficient opportunity to adjust their own generation rates and rebids in such a way as would have prevented the Respondents from achieving very substantial net revenue gains from their rebidding conduct.’ … noting that the ‘Gate Closure’ referred to above is what we speak about as Gate Closure #2 , which has improved more recently (as a result of AEMO efforts) to be well under 67 seconds. (C4) Five (or more?) Experts It seems that there were at least 5 Experts called on to provide expert assistance during the trial – as follows: 1) Dr Shaun Ledgerwood , a Principal of the economic consulting firm, The Brattle Group 2) Mr Euan Morton of Synergies Economic Consulting 3) Mr Derek Holt , who is a Partner of AlixPartners UK LLP 4) Dr Ian Rose , who is an Associate Partner at Ernst & Young … and who was one of the co-founders of Global-Roam Pty Ltd (publisher of WattClarity ®) back in 2000, but who has had no involvement with our business for almost 20 years. 5) Mr Daniel Price , who is co-owner and Managing Director of Frontier Economics Pty Ltd. If I had time, I’d be particularly scanning the judgement to see what these people said. (C5) ‘Profit Maximising’ as a term in the Judgement Scanning the DOCX of the judgement, there are 64 search results for the word ‘profit’ … 5 of which are used in the context of ‘profit maximising’ , as follows: 1) The first reference (p45/247) was as follows: ‘109 It is significant that the AEMC also recognises the importance of price volatility is a necessary and inherent feature of the NEM. In 2013, in its Potential Generator Market Power in the NEM, Final Rule Determination (26 April 2013) at 24, the AEMC stated: Indeed, absent of any intentionally anti-competitive conduct by a dominant generator, profit maximising behaviour as manifested by bidding prices above [short run marginal costs ( SRMC )] is behaviour that is expected and displayed by a generator with some unhedged capacity in a workably competitive market.’ 2) The second reference (p136 of 247) was as follows: ‘393. It was also put to Mr Holt in cross-examination that competing Generators, who are assumed to be profit maximising , have “nothing to gain by not responding to the forecast spike in dispatch price and, ultimately, spot price for the trading interval”. Mr Holt disagreed. He explained that it is reasonable to expect that, by the time a withholding bid was made, a rival Generator would have already formed its own view as to the price at which it was willing to dispatch its capacity. As CS Energy submitted, this assessment would be reflected in the rival Generator’s existing bid. In that context, notice of an elevated dispatch price which was higher than earlier forecasts, but still lower than the price at which the rival Generator had bid its capacity, would not necessarily cause the rival Generator to change the price at which it was prepared to offer its output. Rather, the extent to which notice of a future elevated dispatch price would cause a rival Generator to reprice its own capacity would depend upon that Generator’s own commercial and operational considerations, including plant characteristics, fuel availability, and start up and marginal costs. Mr Holt also observed that whether a pre-dispatch price signal would in fact translate into an actual price spike was a matter on which there is “a lot of uncertainty” and in such circumstances, it was possible that a rival Generator might choose to “stand firm” and not react to a forecast elevated dispatch price. Alternatively, Mr Morton suggested, “[t]hey may perceive an opportunity to drive the price still higher again because they know that one of their competitors is not going to exert a competitive constraint that they perceived before that commitment”. 394 Similarly, Mr Price (with whom Dr Rose agreed), said: Dr Ledgerwood often talks about the so-called first mover advantage. In fact, in many ways it is a first mover disadvantage because they are the ones who are taking the heat on output. And that’s why you get the pile-in. It is 100 per cent certain that you are going to get that price if you get dispatched and so that’s really kind of what they’re looking for as well. Because what it will do, as Dr Ledgerwood has said, it will elevate the whole trading interval price. So even if the dispatch interval price following the pile in reduces they still get the benefit of the elevation trading interval price. So it is much more certain for them as compared to trying to defeat the price which makes no commercial sense. 395 I am unable to accept that the only competitive response from participants in the NEM was to rebid in an attempt to mitigate or abate a price spike.’ 3) The third reference (p204 of 247) was as follows: ‘624 Dr Ledgerwood did not accept that the QNI was “particularly close to binding”. He could not, however, give evidence as to whether CS Energy traders would take the same view. Nor could express a view as to the point at which he would describe the QNI as close to binding. Dr Ledgerwood opined, nevertheless, that it was the rebids which caused the QNI to bind. It was also not in dispute that, in DI4, the QNI started to bind. However, it was not necessarily the rebids which caused the QNI to bind. It was also not in dispute that, in DI4, demand in the QRNEM increased by 72MW. It was put to Dr Ledgerwood in cross-examination that that alone would have been sufficient to close the gap of 34MW on the QNI. Indeed, he accepted such an increase in demand “could cause” the QNI to bind. Further, at the time of CS Energy’s prior rebids of Callide C and Callide B (at 16:42:10), and Gladstone (at 16:58:36), the pre-dispatch information indicated that the unused capacity on the QNI in the DI ending at 17:15 would be between 109MW and 168MW (JtEMER at [536]). There is no basis for rejecting the trader’s explanation at the time of the rebids that they were a response to tightening market conditions and were a rational response for a profit maximising entity .’ 4) The fourth reference (p215 of 247) was as follows: ‘662 Stillwater submitted that, although the rebid reasons were factually accurate, as agreed by both Dr Ledgerwood and Dr Rose (2LedgerwoodR at [1178]; 2RoseR, Table 39), that “does not detract … from the fact that the log clearly records that the rebids were made to achieve a price volume trade-off”. So much can be accepted. It is plain on the face of the reasons that the trader was trying to achieve a price volume trade-off, consistent with Stanwell’s strategy and its incentive as a profit maximising firm . The log does not, however, provide evidence that Stanwell was engaged in Short-notice Rebidding. Stanwell’s rebid was submitted at 15:12:09, approximately two minutes after the trader observed Callide C’s generation at 15:10. The rebid applied across several generating units, albeit only for a short period. There is no evidence of delay.’ 5) The fifth reference (p235 of 247) was as follows: ‘733 As to profitability, and as I have already observed, Dr Ledgerwood did not consider whether Short-notice Rebidding would be profitable absent substantial market power. What evidence there was as to the profitability of CS Energy (and by analogy, Stanwell) was inconsistent with any hypothesis that prices are high relative to costs during the Conduct Period (JtEcER at [350]). In respect of CS Energy, Dr Holt’s evidence was that its return on underlying capital employed was either negative or below 8% (JtEcER at [350]). Similarly, Mr Morton’s evidence was that Stanwell’s actual revenue over the Conduct Period was materially below its assessed efficient cost. He opined (JtEcER at [273]), [t]he difference between notional spot market revenue and assessed efficient cost was greater still. In combination with the assumption that Stanwell is a profit maximising entity , this provides support for the proposition that Stanwell did not have or use substantial market power over that period. ’ (D) What comes next … So for this court case itself, it seems that all that’s left is for the court to award costs in March 2025 … though I’m not aware of whether appeals are possible in this type of court action (and, if so, if this might be chosen as a court of action)? For us at Global-Roam Pty Ltd (publisher of WattClarity ®) we hope to have more time to read through the Judgement in more detail, in order to enhance our learning … and will be looking to learn from lawyers who will be much better placed to explain what it all means in practice. And for the National Electricity Market … what comes next?",

    "title": "Curtailment concerns provide a view of the future",
    "date": "09-12-2024 03:13:00 PM",
    "content": "Taking another look at the 27 th of November we aggregate the supply availability measures reported in Availability utilisation on 27 November 2024 in NSW into region totals. The region aggregates show how supply was curtailed rather than priced out between 14:30 and 16:10 (approximately). The curtailment component represents the majority of the gap during that time. We calculate curtailment was upwards of 2,000 MW during the extreme periods. The regional total for NSW supply dispatched, curtailed and priced out was as follows: Curtailed availability not able to alleviate reserve levels Stating the obvious with that header, but permit me to elaborate. When max spare capacity of a PASA result drops below a threshold a LOR1 or LOR2 condition may be declared. If there are constraints impacting supply there will be a lower projection of spare capacity, increasing the chance of LOR conditions. In the chart below we highlight the low spare capacity levels of the November 27 in light yellow and orange. In the chart below we see: PASA max spare capacity, which dropped below the LOR2 level in the 15:30 to 16:00 half-hour. We also construct two additional series’ to arrive at alternative views of capacity: Series [Max spare capacity + curtailed availability] Adding curtailed supply to max spare capacity aids evaluation of the extent to which availability that was curtailed might have raised reserve levels, if not needing to be curtailed. Series [Max spare capacity + curtailed availability + forced interconnector exports] Including forced exports accounts for an additional impact of network congestion that can force interconnector flows out of NSW. During the high NSW price period flows to VIC or QLD were often forced to flow in a counter-price direction. When we focus on the period when the availability gap was predominately driven by curtailment (14:30 to 16:10) , and we inspecting the +curtailed series: The chart demonstrates how curtailed supply (if able to be dispatched) could have kept NSW out of LOR1 and LOR2 territory in the leadup to 16:00. Preventing interconnector exports could have helped too. After 16:00 the level of spare capacity + curtailed fluctuated about the LOR1 threshold. What might this mean for reserves in 2027? I’ve taken a back-of-the envelope approach to making an estimate on what the events of the 27 th might tell us about meeting demand in 2027, once Eraring closes . Some data points we will use are: During the period of extreme prices Eraring’s availability was 1,950 MW (unit 3 was offline, so not contributing, other units were available but under max capacity). Bayswater’s unit 2 and 3 were out reducing supply availability from that power station by 1,370 MW (685 MW each, based on unit 4’s availability being ~685 MW on the day). So let’s now consider we are at September 2027, instead of 2024. Eraring has closed. If we use conditions of the day, availability would be down -1,950 MW; a reduction for Eraring’s availability. But we might (optimistically?) expect Bayswater’s 4 units to be running; we add 1,370 MW. Note this could also come from any of the dispatchable generators that were unavailable on the day. But is seems conservative to not expect 100% availability from all units in September. That leaves us in a net position of -580 MW, lower in supply availability, all else being equal. To replace this with VRE, for the conditions on the day, we might assume the day’s availability factors the percentage of max capacity that was available for dispatch. Availability factors on the day for wind did vary but we had to pick a number. In the interest of simplicity we take 48% for wind and 43% for solar (performance in interval 15:10). So we may now say that we would require somewhere between 1,200 and 1,400 MW of VRE (depending on the mix) to provide the equivalent supply availability of that removed by closures in 2027 (net of Bayswater providing more). After recently glancing at AEMO Generation information (October 2024 release) it does appear we are on kinda on track to see this, in NSW. For solar, NSW looks to be adding 1,960 MW (committed and anticipated) by the end of 2027. For wind, NSW looks to be adding 470 MW (committed and anticipated) by Feb 2028. Actually, that’s not that much, and most of it is Uunugula wind farm (414 MW by Feb 2028). So, there’s potential to exceed that 1,200 – 1,400 MW replacement level we approximated above (while the sun is shining). In the clear, right? Well, what about curtailment? Let’s reflect on network congestion on the day. Solar and wind availability was already curtailed considerably. How much more can we add and realistically expect it to be able to be dispatched? To recap, here are the two curtailment-by-fuel-type charts for solar and wind: So, to try to conclude. On the 27th November 2024: It appears there was enough supply to keep the region out of LOR1 conditions on the 27th during the spiciest part of the day. Yet spare capacity did dip into the LOR2 zone. Contributing was the curtailed availability, at times in at the level of 1,000 – 2,000 MW. So the problem appeared a transmission congestion problem rather than specifically a supply problem. Looking to the future: There may be enough VRE in the pipeline to help cover Eraring’s closure in MW terms, for a day like the one we analysed and also with our assumptions. (a net reduction of 580 MW, adding committed and anticipated new VRE builds, and if we also include 1,370 MW of coal unit availability not being offline). Demand was not that high though! However, curtailment was restricting NSW generation on the 27 th . Particularly wind and solar. With this in mind, it is foreseeable that adding more generation in the already-constrained parts of the network will materially suffer from congestion, impacting ability to meet demand in 2027. We already knew that it’s not only “what you build” but “where you build it” . The circumstances of the November 27, 2024, provided another demonstration of this.",

    "title": "Mercury Rising: Recent NSW prices and the impact on customers",
    "date": "09-12-2024 01:34:00 PM",
    "content": "With the first of the hot weather arriving in Sydney, the New South Wales region of the NEM is seeing a number of Lack of Reserve (LOR) warnings. Editor’s Note – worth highlighting in particular Wednesday 27th November 2024 , where LOR3 (load shedding) was forecast but not enacted, but RERT (Reserve Trader) was triggered. Moreover, recent contract price outcomes in the region are higher than at almost any other time save for the energy crisis of 2022 . All signs point to a precarious position for consumers as we enter summer 2024-25 and beyond that through 2025. Against this backdrop, it seems timely to survey recent outcomes for price, demand and generation in NSW and to ask the question: what is happening to the price of energy in NSW, and who are the winners and losers? Historical spot prices in NSW We start by considering the basics – what are the recent outcomes for NSW spot prices, and how does this compare to historical outcomes? Chart 1 shows average annual spot prices for each of the mainland regions of the NEM on a calendar year basis from 2000 to 2024 YTD. We have highlighted the current year-to-date average for NSW of $126.70 per MWh. NSW spot prices are currently the highest of all four NEM regions, and are at an all-time high save for 2022, when outcomes were driven by the energy crisis. Chart 1 – NSW Spot Prices are at record levels save for the 2022 energy crisis Annual average spot prices on a calendar year basis for mainland regions of the NEM, 2000 to 2024 YTD But this is not the whole story. Chart 2 shows the breakdown of these average prices into three bands: Prices above $300 per MWh, shown in light blue. Prices below $300 per MWh but above $0 per MWh, shown in dark blue. Negative prices, shown in red. The combined height of the three bars represents the time-weighted average price for the quarter, as shown in Chart 1. The different components show the contribution of each category of prices to the annual average. The recent outcomes for NSW in 2024 YTD show that the +$300 per MWh component prices are at record levels of $32.53 per MWh, with most of December still to come. Even during the energy crisis of 2022 , the value of the cap never reached these levels. Chart 2 – The value in the cap is at an all-time record level for NSW Annual average prices by price band, NSW, 2000 to 2024 YTD Is a rising market price cap the culprit? One factor that has not been constant over the period shown in chart 3 is the market price cap (MPC). Chart 3 shows the historical progression of the market price cap since 2003 (ie, when the MPC rose to $10,000 per MWh) versus the average value of +$2000 per MWh prices (ie, prices representing scarcity pricing). We have capped all prices above $10,000 per MWh to show normalise for the effect of rises in the MPC. Even after adjusting for this, 2024 has been a record year , although the higher market price cap is making a substantial contribution to the additional value in the cap. This is not to say this is unwarranted, but merely to observe that changes in the market price cap over time are only partly responsible for the higher levels of cap prices. Chart 3 – Even after accounting for a rising MPC, 2024 represents a new record for +$2000 MWh value Count of number of intervals where NSW price exceeds $2000 per MWh by quarter, Q1 2005 to Q4 2024 What’s been happening with demand? What more can we learn about what is happening here? For starters, it is helpful to have the background of what has happened to demand in NSW over the last 25 years. Chart 4 shows a plot of every 5-minutes of demand since 2000. By way of explanation: Each panel of the chart shows the outcomes for a single year. We have included only every second year (ie, 2000, 2002, 2004, …, 2024 YTD). We have added a line to each panel showing the average demand for each year. To aid in visualisation we have added a colour scale. The change in the shape of demand is striking. Solar PV has crushed demand in the middle of the day, leaving two sharp peaks in the early morning and late afternoon/early evening. However, the time-of-day plot reveals that there are still extensive periods where the system needs to be able to cope with high levels of demand. Put another way, falling average demand has not removed the maximum levels of demand that we see in the system. Chart 4 – The shape of demand has changed drastically over the last 25 years Plot of all NSW demand outcomes by time-of-day for every second year, 2000 to 2024 YTD We see a similar story for residual demand, ie, demand minus large-scale solar and wind. Chart 5 shows the same analysis as Chart 4, but for residual demand. Once again, the change is striking, with residual demand for NSW now reaching down to levels of almost zero net demand for energy. And yet we still see the upper envelope of maximum and peak demand remaining stubborn – periods remain where the system is reliant on dispatchable generation for the morning and evening peaks. Chart 5 – Residual demand has reduced from around 9000 MW to 6000 MW in the last 15 years Plot of all NSW residual demand outcomes by time-of-day for every second year, 2010 to 2024 YTD So what is the relationship between extreme price outcomes (ie, where price exceeds $2000 per MWh) and demand? Chart 6 shows the count of the number of such intervals by quarter, coloured by the overall level of demand. We see that the outcomes over the past year are unprecedented – we have never before seen so many high-priced events for four consecutive quarters . What is more, these outcomes are occurring at relatively low levels of demand , often less than 10,000 MW. Chart 6 – We have not seen 4 consecutive quarters with this frequency of +$2000 per MWh events Count of number of intervals where NSW price exceeds $2000 per MWh by quarter, Q1 2005 to Q4 2024 Who are the winners and losers? So prices are high and these high prices are being heavily driven by extreme price events, many of which are occurring at moderate levels of demand. Who are the winners and losers? To understand this, we have compiled a chart showing the dispatch weighted prices earned by each of the main technology types in NSW: solar, wind, gas, hydro, and coal. We note that this is only part of the story – the contract market has not been factored into our analysis. But our analysis still sheds light on the underlying question of what a generator can earn in the spot market – a relevant reference point for a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), a standardised contract, or a physical hedge. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the chart shows that gas and hydro are making record dispatch-weighted prices – even higher than during the 2022 energy crisis. But more remarkable is that coal is earning an astonishing $141 per MWh this year . Wind is also doing well relative to historical levels, with prices exceeding $100 per MWh in 2024. In contrast, solar is only seeing modest returns of $63 per MWh – about half of the average price in NSW. Chart 7 – Gas and hydro are making record returns in NSW, while solar struggles Dispatch-weighted prices for black coal, gas, hydro, wind and solar in NSW, 2010 to 2024 YTD Conclusion The prices in NSW are unprecedented, in terms of the amount of value that we are seeing in the +$300 per MWh component of prices. The big winners out of this are the thermal generators that can shape their generation to capture these prices. To a lesser degree, intermittent generators that are producing at all (ie, wind) during high price events are also capturing value. The clear losers are consumers, particularly residential consumers who draw more power during hotter weather. They can expect to be faced with much higher prices once these cap and swap prices flow through to the Default Market Offer. In addition, the frequency of high price events and the low levels of demand at which these are occurring suggests that the system is under extreme stress. If the trends to date continue in summer cap values will likely reach new records. Far from seeing prices fall as some commentators and institutions have suggested, the market is signalling that the wholesale component of bills in NSW will rise markedly.

    "content": "AEMO’s Frequency Performance Payments (FPP) project has commenced in production today under “non-financial operation” (NFO). This is a trial period whereby market participants will start receiving data generated by the new FPP engine to allow a window of time to become familiar with the operation of the scheme with real data before financial operation commences, expected to be mid next year. This FPP project was actually agreed on back in 2022 with the AEMC’s rule change that also introduced Primary Frequency Response (PFR). Paul wrote about that rule change at the time , noting “incentive arrangements” were a large part of the rule. It’s those “incentive arrangements” that are now known as FPP. In a nutshell, FPP is the successor to the currently operating scheme for allocating Regulation FCAS costs, known as Causer Pays . It’s a new way of allocating incentive payments to generators deemed to have been “helpful” in maintaining system frequency, funded by penalties for those deemed “unhelpful”, across a five minute dispatch interval with respect to the unit’s target and actual output for that interval. The majority of new data to support the scheme will be provided in new MMS tables (mostly prefixed with “FPP_”) and will mostly participant-private in real time, but available for all public next day (4am). Some aggregated data will also be publicly available in near-realtime, including new 4-second resolution frequency data in FPP_REGION_FREQ_MEASURE , available as soon as the FPP run has completed. AEMO has a number of excellent FAQs and technical documents related to both the NFO that goes live today and also the timeline for full Financial Operation go live, scheduled at this stage for 8 June 2025: AEMO’s overall project page outlining the reform here: https://aemo.com.au/initiatives/major-programs/nem-reform-program/nem-reform-program-initiatives/frequency-performance-payments-project The “NFO Go Live Plan” (pdf) FPP Frequently Asked Questions (pdf) It’s important to note the new reports commencing today are not the full set of FPP data, there will also be additional P5MIN and Predispatch forecasts available in the coming months during NFO; these are expected to commence in mid-January. To avoid any doubt, the current Causer Pays arrangements for the recovery of Regulation FCAS will continue in parallel until 8 July 2025, throughout the FPP non financial operation period. We here at Global-Roam along with many other market observers will be interested to unpack the new data as time permits over the next few months.",

    "title": "Initial Review of price volatility in NSW in early afternoon Friday 6th December 2024",
    "date": "07-12-2024 05:33:00 PM",
    "content": "We noted briefly ‘Afternoon volatility in NSW on Friday 6th December 2024’ as the prices were spiking in NSW. During and after the price action there were several conversations we noted (internal and external) about what was happening. That fact, plus some underlying curiosity, drove me to open ez2view today and utilise Time-Travel (and the added clarity of ‘next day public’ data) to take a look at what happened: 1) It was pretty quick to use the pre-configured widgets to track down the significant factors; 2) It took considerably more time to put together this explanatory article! (A) An overview Utilising the ‘Trends Engine’ in ez2view , we start by presenting two basic trends to summarise what actually happened on the day: For those with a licence to the software, you can open your own copy of the above query here . In this trend we’ve highlighted both: 1) the gradual decline in Available Generation (of any wholesale supply source, at any price) in the top line 2) the faster ramp in ‘ Market Demand ’ for the NSW region over 2-3 hours, culminating in the price spike occurring. The above does not take into account any capability for imports from VIC or QLD to help support the escalating demand … but the zoomed-in trend chart below does: For those with a licence to the software, you can open your own copy of the above query here . It shows that: 1) from 14:20 (at 9,594MW) to 14:30 (at 10,996MW – with the first spike) the required dispatch of local supply options inside of NSW climbed by 1,402MW 2) over the same two periods, the Available Generation in NSW climbed by only 123MW (i.e. 13,737MW to 13,860MW). … so the supply-demand balance grew considerably tighter . (B) Specific Dispatch Intervals Let’s start at the 14:20 dispatch interval and use a collage of ez2view widgets in Time-Travel, highlighting only some of what’s visible in each of these images (readers should remember to click on any image to view larger resolution image in separate browser tab). At 14:20 … the NSW price is $299/MWh We’ve added a number of annotations here to help set the scene for the price spike that will emerge in 2 more dispatch intervals: At 14:25 … the NSW price drops, to $76/MWh Five minutes later, the price has dropped … despite the local requirement for ENERGY dispatch of NSW units has climbing by more than 1,000MW : Significantly, we now see that the VIC1-NSW1 interconnector is now: 1) Subject to a bound constraint; but also 2) Constrained such that it must flow south (despite the price differential and hence counter-price flow ). Ironic (but hardly a surprise ), given we’d posted about ‘The most recent 14 days of data for VIC1-NSW1’ on Friday morning 6th December 2024 …. before the afternoon bout of volatility! At 14:30 … the NSW price spikes, to $17,480/MWh This was the first of four dispatch intervals seeing a price spike: If readers are curious as to why there’s ( relatively cheaper) volume apparently available in a few batteries (but which is not dispatched ), let’s us the ‘Constraint Dashboard’ widget to take a closer look at the ‘N::N_CTMN_2’ constraint equation : This is a very rich dashboard allowing many insights to be gleaned … but we’re only going to note here that: 1) The ‘N::N_CTMN_2’ constraint equation (which we have seen before ) is part of the ‘N-MNYS_5_WG_CLOSE’ constraint set (which we have also seen before) 2) Amongst the DUIDs on the LHS are the three batteries in question 3) Despite them all offering volume at bid price bands below the RRP, the CPD Price for each unit is (by virtue of constraint impacts) significantly lower than the RRP and, as such, these units are amongst the units that are ‘constrained down’ by the action of this* constraint. * possibly in conjunction with other constraints (I have not checked). At 14:35 … the NSW price remains high, at $17,499.89/MWh As the 4th dispatch interval included here, we’ll add 14:30 – but with no annotations: At 14:40 … the NSW price drops again, to $299.64/MWh No snapshot here. At 14:40 … the NSW price rises again, to $15,766.43/MWh No snapshot here. At 14:40 … the NSW price drops again, to $299.49/MWh No snapshot here. At 14:55 … the NSW price rises again, at $14,101.50/MWh In this case, here’s a snapshot of ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view zoomed into a narrow window of time and filtered down to show bids just for the NSW battery units: Note that: 1) For a start, there is much less volume of energy bid into NEMDE across the entire 3-hour time range selected – for reasons not explored at this point, but speculated to be due to a combination of: (a) Commissioning; and/or (b) SIPS requirements; and/or (c) Something else 2) Of the smaller volume of energy bid into NEMDE, at 14:55 we already see some BESS are shifting volume to higher-priced bid bands … (a) coincident with a drop in aggregate Target; and (b) perhaps to conserve limited stored energy? (C) Summarising So it’s worth summarizing a number of the significant factors* we’ve already identified that, in combination delivered a period of price volatility in an early afternoon period. * and noting that there may well be other factors not yet identified. Factor 1 = climbing demand It’s not a coincidence that the spikes occurred after a period (from ~12:00 to ~15:00) of climbing ‘ Market Demand ’ – which itself might have been some combination of both: (a) underlying weather patterns driving Underlying Demand ; but also (b) potentially (and I’ve not yet looked) some reduction in Rooftop PV. Factor 2 = inter-regional congestion In this case both QLD and VIC were limited in their ability to support NSW with additional supply options, due to congestion on the interconnectors … creating what we’ve termed before a NSW-only ‘ Economic Island ’ – which had the effect of exacerbating the tight supply-demand balance. Factor 3 = a thin supply curve … increasingly clumped at both ends We’ve written before about the declining volume of energy ‘bid in green’ – as one illustration of how an increasing volume of capacity is clumped at very low and very high prices, with not much in between. 1) We saw in the ‘Current Bids’ widget that this was the case yesterday. 2) This will increasingly lead to: (a) Boom-bust and high-stakes outcomes for participants on the supply side; and (b) Increasing volatility for consumers on the demand side of the market … including as it filters through to retail prices. Factor 4 = constraints are (again) a factor! In a conversation with a generation participant this week (another generator that is considering coming onboard with ez2view … it’s been a busy 6 months for us), part of the reasoning they outlined was that: 1) Increasingly constraints are playing a central role in how dispatch works and how prices are set (a) It’s always been possible that this would be the case, it’s just that their sense is that this is happening increasingly often (b) Whereas perhaps 5-10 years ago, more people were focused on ‘simpler’ economic assessments of bidding behaviour. 2) Aligned with the above is the fact that one of the strengths of ez2view is that: (a) We’ve already invested $Millions over the years in delivering a range of widgets (such as shown above) to help make constraints more understandable; and (b) With our investment plan into 2025 and beyond, this investment will be compounded. In the case of what happened yesterday in NSW, we see above that the ‘N::N_CTMN_2’ constraint equation definitely played a significant role here … along with others not discussed here. Factor 5 = auto-bidders are far from perfect (and should not be expected to be) Finally, the example yesterday revealed yet more examples of where auto-bidders did not produce the ‘perfect’ dispatch outcome for a range of plant. No time to go into more details on this weekend day. Anyone believing that auto-bidders and ‘set and forget’ are all you need for a battery are probably missing the bigger picture. … this was discussed by James Tetlow recently at All Energy .",

    "title": "Today’s discussion (at the Senate Committee) of planned or unplanned outages in the NSW supply fleet on Wednesday 27th November 2024",
    "date": "05-12-2024 07:47:00 PM",
    "content": "It’s happened before … but it’s not often that WattClarity becomes a reference for discussions in Federal Parliament. One of our readers flagged to us that this was the case in today’s session (which is recorded on Youtube here ) of the Senate Committee on Energy Planning and Regulation in Australia: For those who want to replay, suggest you watch around the ~04:48:00 mark. The topic of discussion at that time was what units in NSW were offline through Wednesday 27th November 2024 … which: 1) was a time of tight supply-demand balance in NSW – including: (a) Actual LOR2 and (b) forecast LOR3 ; and (c) triggering of Reserve Trader (a.k.a. RERT ) 2) But also a period where I was attempting to ignore* the NEM and take a short break, leaving the articles on the day ( collated here ) to others**. * with only partial success as those alerts were very persistent! ** 100% success rate with me not posting articles, at least. 3) It’s worth singling out two particular articles relevant to this one: (a) Adam’s article ‘A chronological record of events in NSW on Wednesday 27th November 2024’ is a useful starting point for putting it all in context; and (b) Dan’s article ‘Which units are still offline in NSW and QLD, as of 3:30pm on 27th Nov 2024’ is a useful reference … and might even be the article Matt Canavan referred to in the recording with respect to what happened on the day. Earlier today I’d written about ‘The extended outage at Eraring unit 3 (as at Thu morning 5th Dec 2024)’ (incidentally an article that Matt Canavan had referred to in the recording above) and had noted an intent to take a look back at what I’d missed. Given the topic above was related to which units in NSW were offline*, (including whether planned or unplanned) I thought it would be useful to explore here… * and also given the growing number of questions we’ve been receiving on the broader topic of supply-side unit outages (another article is coming on that one) (A) What Daniel Westerman noted today in the Senate Committee At ~04:38:40 in the video above, Daniel Westerman notes his understanding was that, on Wednesday 27th November 2024 , there were 5 significant units out in NSW. He says: 1) Three units were on planned outage: … ER03, BW02 and TALWA1 2) Two units were on unplanned outage: … BW03 and VP6 (B) What is shown in the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view Opening my own copy of the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view I have chosen to: 1) time-travel back to 15:30 ( NEM time ) on Wednesday 27th November 2024 : …. which was the same dispatch interval used by Linton in his article written on the day ; 2) but I’ve chosen to filter differently (i.e. zooming into just NSW units, and bringing the cap down to 100MW to include some smaller ones) time-travelling back to 15:30 ( NEM time ) on Wednesday 27th November 2024 : As a result of this, we see the following: … for ease of reference, I’ve highlighted the 5 units nominated. (C) It’s not just black and white (or grey and red), in relation to Planned or Unplanned Without falling into that rabbit hole, readers should understand that there is considerable nuance required in understanding whether a unit is on a ‘planned’ or an ‘unplanned’ outage … and even that two equally capable people might describe the same outage in that grey area between black and white differently. From 9th October 2023, the data set published by the AEMO in the MT PASA DUID Availability data space was significantly* enhanced . * alas not for Semi-Scheduled units, but that’s only one aspect of remaining invisibility in the market more broadly. This stemmed from an AEMC Rule Change … part of which the AEMO was required to produce Guidelines for how generators were to classify their outages. These AEMO’s guidelines (subsequently upgraded) drew on various international practice (including IEEE standard 762-2006 … which has since been superseded by IEEE standard 762-2023 ). Without readers falling down their own rabbit hole, a key take-away is that there’s some subjectivity involved in trying to squeeze every outage permutation into two broad buckets, if that’s all that’s allowed in terms of categories . That’s further complicated by the fact that the ez2view software classifies (i.e. colours) outages utilising logic embedded in the software interpreting what each individual participant has submitted (and the AEMO has hence published) as data: 1) Planned outages are (mostly) shown as ‘grey’ in the ‘Generator Outages’ widget. 2) Unplanned outages are shown as ‘red’ in the ‘Generator Outages’ widget. Let’s look at the 5 cases noted above… (D) What about the 5 units specifically mentioned? Let’s work through each in turn (in each case utilising the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget * in ez2view (also time-travelled to 15:30 ( NEM time ) on Wednesday 27th November 2024 ), in the order they have been highlighted in the image above: * Remember that this widget allows one to ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to see ‘ that other dimension of time ’. BW02 … shown as ‘Basic Planned Outage’ With this image we see that the outage was planned over a year in advance and, at the time of the snapshot, appeared to be running to schedule: BW03 … shown as ‘Unplanned Forced Outage’ In contrast, here, this is clearly an unplanned outage : ER03 … shown as ‘Extended Planned Outage’ Remember that this morning we subsequently* wrote about ‘The extended outage at Eraring unit 3 (as at Thu morning 5th Dec 2024)’ * i.e. we now know that the outage plans changed somewhat. But back at 15:30 ( NEM time ) on Wednesday 27th November 2024 , we already saw that there’d been two instances of slippage of expected return to service dates. I can see why the participant has classified this as a planned outage … but important to keep in mind that this outage has been extended (for reasons unknown at this point). VP6 … shown as ‘Extended Planned Outage’ The picture above (for ER03) has some similarities for VP6: In this case there’s been one slippage of expected return to service date … but not to the same extent as for ER03 above: 1) Only one slippage for VP6. 2) Not as much delay. I can also see why the participant has classified this as a planned outage … but important to keep in mind that this outage has been extended (for reasons unknown at this point). Note that ( unless I misheard? ) Daniel Westerman referred to this unit as an unplanned outage , but I’d not have classified it as such (especially if ER03 was planned)? Zooming into this display (image not shown here) we see that: 1) Until the end of the day on 15th November 2024 , the participant had the expected return to service date as Monday 25th November 2024 2) From that point forwards, the expected return to service date was 1st December 2024 or 2nd December 2024 (it varied a few times). Given we used ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget for ER03 in this morning’s article , we take a similar approach with this image … albeit that this window is also time-travelled to 15:30 ( NEM time ) on Wednesday 27th November 2024 : As highlighted there, there were submissions made of (new) ‘Daily Bids’ on the early evening of 16th November 2024 to take account of the extended outage. There does not need to be a rebid reason for these (i.e. they are Daily Bids, not Rebids after Gate Closure #1 ), so we’re none the wiser as to the reason for the extension to the outage. TALWA1 … shown as ‘Basic Planned Outage’ Here’s a view of the same widget for Tallawarra A: In this case a planned outage, with (at this point) no slippage in expected return to service. (E) From a Reliability (i.e. capital ‘R’) perspective Whilst this example could easily lead to readers falling down the rabbit hole in terms of defining outages, at the end of the day one perspective is to ask oneself whether each of these 5 units were expected to be available and operational (say) N days/months prior to Wednesday 27th November 2024. If using this line of questioning: 1) BW02 and TALWA1 behaved ‘according to the plan’ produced many weeks (months!) beforehand; 2) BW03 clearly did not 3) For ER03 and VP6, it really depends on ones frame of reference. … especially with Wednesday 27th November 2024 being a very sensitive day (with extra cost incurred for RERT, high prices in the spot market, public calls for conservation, and ‘blackouts’ in the news headlines etc…). … and finally, with respect to ‘according to plan’ here’s something (obliquely relevant?) that comes to mind for me . That’s all for now.",

    "title": "Mothballed diesel generators might be brought back in SA",
    "date": "05-12-2024 02:03:00 PM",
    "content": "A recent AFR article on December 2 2024 brought the initiative to our attention. The AFR article, linked via the image below, reported that the SA Government is urgently seeking to have the mothballed Snuggery and Port Lincoln diesel power stations reactivated . The proposal of the SA Government comes in the form of a rule change: South Australian jurisdictional derogation – Interim reliability reserve eligibility . The change requests that AEMO be allowed to consider two additional plant for IRR in summer. The two additional plant are the Snuggery and Port Lincoln power stations. IRR means interim reliability reserves. AEMO’s Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT) report for Q1 2024 clarifies: “ Interim Reliability Reserves are a category of RERT which AEMO may procure for up to three years to address interim reliability exceedances identified in the AEMO Electricity Statement of Opportunities (ESOO) or updates to the ESOO. ” RERT eligibility includes being ‘out of market’ If the derogation is accepted, AEMO will be able to consider these generators eligible for RERT. Owner Engie will then be able to negotiate procurement of these resources with AEMO under the RERT mechanism. Currently the rules require AEMO to only consider out of market resources for RERT. This is to prevent so called ‘double dipping’ between the wholesale market and this emergency mechanism. The change is requested because both Snuggery and Port Lincoln were available and last dispatched in the market on 1 July 2024 , so they aren’t eligible, currently. That timing of being mothballed meant the generators don’t meet the criteria for having been out for at least 12 months. They were mothballed at that time by owner Engie who announced the move earlier in the year . Motivation The SA Government, in its request , cites delays to Project Energy Connect are compounding the already identified shortfall identified in AEMO’s 2024 ESOO . In addition to noting fluctuations in ESOO reliability gaps over the years, it also notes the limited pool of out of market reserves it can draw upon for RERT within SA. It asks for the generators to be considered eligible for the next two years. Project Energy Connect (PEC) Taking the motivation of the SA Government, that PEC is critical to SA’s reliability outlook let’s revisit the project’s details. A deep dive into the background and progress of the project, PEC, was published earlier in 2024 in A tale of two mega-projects: Project Energy Connect and Snowy 2.0 timelines (Part 1) . In short it is a new transmission link from SA to NSW. Stage 1 of PEC (PEC1) will increase transfer capacity from VIC to SA (and vice versa) by 150 MW. This increase is to be managed in dispatch as a combined flow on the V-SA (Heywood) interconnector. It is linked to VIC rather than NSW because Stage 1 stops at Buronga which then flows to VIC (via Red Cliffs). It is modelled as an increase on the Heywood interconnector as flows at the two points will be managed in tandem. PEC1 has been undergoing commissioning testing in recent months. PEC Stage 2 (PEC2) is anticipated to have completed commissioning a while later, in Q4 2027. This extends the transmission into NSW to Wagga Wagga. The combined flow capability into SA, once PEC2 is complete, across V-SA and PEC interconnectors, is anticipated to be 1300 MW . A collection of articles relating to PEC, including many observations on commissioning milestones, is available here : An updated look at firming capacity in SA In-market dispatchable (scheduled) capacity is what’s needed to firm renewables in the long-term. To monitor this, we present the changes in max capacity ( note the pros and cons of using this parameter ) of scheduled supply resources in SA over the past and into the future. We chart two variations: A conservative view of firming capacity to 2027 using only committed scheduled generation projects in SA. Optimistic view, including anticipated projects, and including the additional import capability afforded by PEC stages 1 and 2. Both variants make adjustments (using estimates) to account for capacity reserved for SIPS or SIPS-like programs. Conservative view: Current SA outlook with ESOO committed generation only This first chart captures the bare-bones, conservative, view of firming capacity to 2027 using only committed scheduled generation projects in SA (October 2024 Generation Information). It’s clear that the retirement of Osborne and Torrens Island B put a considerable dent in scheduled supply capacity. Keen-eyed readers will observe the up-down in September/October 2024 which was the cutover of batteries (as load/gen) to bidirectional units. Optimistic view: Current SA outlook with ESOO committed and anticipated generation, and PEC This view suggests that PEC is critical in providing an option for additional power to enter SA. Large BESS units are also visible in contributing to increases capacity in 2025 and 2026. Risks to PEC flows: There is an acknowledged risk (likelihood) that the loop flows created by PEC2 will contribute to greater potential for accumulation of interregional negative settlements residues, and that would lead to restricting flows on PEC under current management approaches. However, there is a rule change in progress to reform how negative residues around loop flows may be managed. The rule change, when implemented, is anticipated reduce the amount of dispatch clamping that will be required on the interconnectors as part of the normal occurrence of negative settlement residues from the commencement of PEC. Read more about this here . Negative residues may be a topic for a separate article. Yet it seems prudent to anticipate that the full capacity of PEC may not always be available to flow into SA, for this reason but likely others too. On the above chart, we’ve included the increases to SA import from PEC1&2. For the chart we set PEC1 to add 150 MW in January 2025, being additional schedulable capacity for supply into SA. We added an additional 550 MW in 2027 to account for additional capacity with PEC2, representing the difference between the typical Heywood limit of 600MW, plus 150 for PEC1, and the 1300MW combined potential when PEC2 is operational. Heywood interconnector limits and target flows hit a max of 600MW (V-SA, into SA), so we have used that rather than the notional 650 MW transfer capacity. “Anticipated” projects are also considered in ESOO modelling for reliability analysis. There is less certainty about the timing of these projects and they are more likely to see delays. But there is still likelihood that they will proceed in some form eventually. Coverage of the proposal in other media The move to permit the diesel gensets to be eligible for RERT has been reported elsewhere too. We’ve observed the following: RenewEconomy: https://reneweconomy.com.au/south-australia-wants-to-bring-back-mothballed-diesel-plants-due-to-lack-of-demand-side-options/ 7 News Adelaide: https://x.com/7NewsAdelaide/status/1863477669469540469?t=hbwwX3z2nnFm9ur8uIGkxw&s=09 And as we mentioned earlier, the AFR: https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/south-australia-wants-to-restart-diesel-plants-as-cable-dream-frays-20241129-p5kun1",

    "title": "The extended outage at Eraring unit 3 (as at Thu morning 5th Dec 2024)",
    "date": "05-12-2024 09:33:00 AM",
    "content": "It’s my first day back in the office after some time on leave, and then travelling for work – and I’m hoping to find some time to review what’s been happening in the market the past couple weeks. But I thought I’d first take a quick look at Eraring unit 3, given it was the focus of Colin Packham’s article yesterday ‘NSW’s largest coal power station suffers fresh delays ahead of hot weather return’ in the Australian. Utilising three widgets in ez2view , we see the following… (A) Looking at changing outage plans Firstly, let’s use the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget at 08:55 ( NEM time ) on Thursday 5th December 2024 to take a look at how the outage plans have changed somewhat over time: Remember that this widget allows one to ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to see ‘ that other dimension of time ’. In this case we’re looking at the MT PASA DUID Availability data set, filtered down just to the ER03 unit and zoomed into ‘more recent’ periods (i.e. not the full 3 year + year window now possible following the extension to the data set). We see that: 1) This was a planned outage on the agenda for ~18 months 2) But there were some modifications to plans closer to the outage date: (a) It came off early … we noted on 26th August 2024 that ‘Eraring Unit 3 offline for planned outage … but no more outages planned for Eraring through to 2027 (yet?)’ (b) The outage was prolonged. i. First extension was announced in June 2024, with the planned RTS extended (from 22nd October) to 11th November; … we’ve not explored why that was the case – it could be for various reasons, including personnel or plant ii. Then in early October there was a second extension announced – with the planned RTS shifted back to 28th November; iii. In recent days More recently there’s been the wobbles that Colin mentions in his article. (B) Current outage plans Utilising the ‘Generator Outages’ widget at 09:05 ( NEM time ) on Thursday 5th December 2024 , we show the state of outage plans across the 44 x remaining coal units in the NEM: It looks like: 1) In the data shown in this widget, we see ER03 is expected to be back on Sunday 8th if not sooner … … we note in Colin’s article he says: ‘The unit was initially scheduled to return on November 27, but suffered a delay as works were then set to be finished on November 29. But work continued until this week when, on Tuesday, the unit was restarted.

    "title": "AEMO’s 2024 Intermittent Generator Forum provides renewed awareness for wind and solar generators",
    "date": "04-12-2024 12:13:00 PM",
    "content": "AEMO hosted the Intermittent Generator Forum on December 3, 2024. These forums typically happen once each year so a large body of information was presented in the 2-hour session this time. Points of interest Information spanned the following topics: Recent improvements to AEMO intermittent generator forecasting systems, Future improvements underway and proposed, A weather data initiative, A guest presentation by AER on “biasing”. Advice on updating intermittent generator availability, and Perspectives and updates from the AEMO control room regarding measures, and capabilities, for managing inverters for power system security. If slides are published by AEMO we’ll endeavour to update this post with a link when available. Until then, we’ve collated the following points from the forum. Recent improvements to AEMO forecasting systems The recent improvements to AEMO forecasts were highlighted. These included: Improvements to accuracy performance in 2022 (15% improvement to the dispatch forecast models), Enhancement of ASEFS and AWEFS forecasts provided by AEMO – from Wednesday 23th November 2022 In 2023, enablement of bid Max Avail for semi-scheduled generators – this equips participants with a way to restrict unit availability for commercial reasons, for dispatch, and acts as a backup for communicating physical availability when SCADA signals are not available. Implemented: Enablement of bid energy MaxAvail for semi-scheduled generators Publishing actual SCADA availability data – elements available and the local limit In November 2024, self-forecast submission API upgrades – in response to slow submission times due to volume of submissions, upgrades to the API have drastically improved the speed of self-forecasts to be submitted and accepted into AEMO systems. Other administrative changes, including Managing how TLS certificates are created, Clarity on who can submit an application for participant self-forecasting. Future improvements underway and proposed The audience now understands there’s a bunch of improvement work that AEMO is doing to transform the forecasts it produces. Improving the AWEFS/ASEFS dispatch forecast models (the FCST analog, typically used during early stages of onboarding, will no longer be required). Anticipating early 2025. Uplifting systems to support a multi-vendor approach to forecast models used. We anticipate that when multiple models are making forecasts there’ll be a ‘track’ table that indicates which one is eventually used. Anticipating December 2025. Rooftop PV actuals and forecasts are getting a revamp. Particularly the introduction of 5-min forecasts (P5-min) and actuals, alongside 30-min actuals and forecasts. A multi vendor approach to forecasts is also planned. Anticipating December 2025. The Observation Hub Project Attendees were introduced to the Observation Hub Project and received the call for collaboration and feedback on the project. The project was announced in the NEM engineering framework roadmap . December 17 2024 is the deadline for feedback to op.foreasting. The project aims to make enhanced use of weather observation data that is being collected at intermittent generator sites. The weather data can contribute to improved AEMO wind and solar forecasts. It’s also envisaged that appropriate, controlled, sharing of this data could support specific industries including emergency services. A guest presentation by AER on “biasing” We’ve prepared a separate article on this item: AER sends clear message on self-forecasting behaviours We’ve noted the following reflections in other media: Overwatch Energy on LinkedIn. Advice on updating intermittent generator availability It’s always good to reflect upon the inputs AEMO uses for its forecasts. Helpful because the industry in general is undergoing a lot of change – new market participants coming in, staff changes, and market reforms all happening (seemingly) at the same time making it a challenge to keep up to date with requirements and responsibilities. Yet we must. Intermittent generator availability information is a key input to AEMO forecasts in the pre-dispatch and ST-PASA timeframes. There was particular focus in the forum on availability under extreme weather conditions. A degree of understanding is required to effectively submit values for local limits, inverters available, turbines in extreme wind cut-out states, high-temperature impacts on inverters (deratings). Perspectives and updates from the AEMO control room The real time operations group at AEMO, as the name implies, operates the power system in real time, principally through the control room. Attendees at the forum gained an appreciation of potential ambiguity in what it means to turn off a semi-scheduled unit’s inverter. This was discussed in the context of AEMO needing to have fine-grained control on inverter-based resources for system security. Current approaches involve the control room making phone calls to participants to make the necessary changes to inverter settings when needed. Even under normal conditions this can result in a large number of phone calls. We gathered that, as more and more semi-scheduled inverter-based VRE enters the market the time needed to make individual calls is becoming a looming barrier to effect timely change at plant inverters. To turn off an inverter? We understood this can mean stopping it from exporting active power or going further to prevent it from any interaction with the power system. This latter case is needed in situations where the control room needs enhanced control of the power system. Work is underway to consider whether these power system requirements can be automated to address issues raised with phone calls. E.g. though constraints. Yet it appears there is some ambiguity in what it means to ‘turn off’. Categories discussed included “blocked”, “paused”, “disconnected” and discussion indicated that certain words or phrases may mean different things to different people. Further, differences between these categories may require different actions (and time) on behalf of plant operators. And, importantly, there are differences in how the inverter interacts with the power system when in these states. We look forward to seeing support for AEMO in its efforts to effectively manage the system, and in resolving potential ambiguity around inverter control so that participants respond as necessary when needed.",

    "title": "AER sends clear message on self-forecasting behaviours",
    "date": "04-12-2024 12:12:00 PM",
    "content": "In the December 2024 AEMO intermittent Generator Forum, the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) accepted a welcome opportunity to present its perspectives on self-forecast biasing . Self-forecasting is the provision of an unconstrained intermittent generation forecast that represents a unit’s power generation availability for the end of the upcoming dispatch interval. Sometimes it is also referred to as the dispatch self-forecast as it is used in dispatch to determine the unit’s generation availability. Significant concerns In short, AER communicated that it holds significant concerns with the biasing of self-forecasts for commercial benefit. It expects participants ensure that self-forecasts contain an accurate reflection of expected generation capability . Ongoing work on compliance and enforcement The presentation leveraged the work of the AER’s Wholesale Compliance Team. It is motivated by Priority 3 of AER’s Compliance and Enforcement (C&E) Priorities for 2024/25 which is to: Support power system security and an efficient wholesale electricity market by focusing on generators’ compliance with offers, dispatch instructions, bidding behaviour obligations and providing accurate and timely information to Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). Readers can find the C&E Priorities for 2024/25 through the link below: Self-forecasting, a valuable addition to the market The concerns around biasing raised by AER don’t represent call to shut down the self-forecasting capability for participants. AER said that self-forecasting helps AEMO access more accurate wind and solar availability forecasts and this improves power system security . It’s clear AER sees self-forecasting as a valuable addition to the market. This is a sentiment shared widely across industry. The problem with biasing The AER concerns over biasing – where the unconstrained dispatch availability forecast is deliberately under or over stated – were highlighted in relation to: Adverse impacts on system security and dispatch outcomes, Reductions in the accuracy of AEMO’s forecasting, Competitive advantages due to targeting lower ‘ causer pays ’ costs (and therefore those costs shared among fewer others), and Potential higher costs being passed on to consumers. In targeting lower causer pays costs by employing self-forecast biasing participants are treating self-forecasts are commercial parameters. AER clearly mentioned that semi-scheduled generators should seek not to treat self-forecasts as commercial parameters. AEMO’s Manager of Operational Forecasting also noted, in ensuing discussion, that biases do adversely impact power system operation, and make AEMO forecasts less dependable impacting control room operations which must trust self-forecasts. A further expectation of AER’s, related to having better forecasts, was that semi-scheduled generators should regularly assess the performance of their self-forecasts and apply learnings to continually improve the accuracy of the forecasts. WattClarity interest in self-forecasting continues Here at WattClarity we’ve long been interested in the performance of intermittent generator self-forecasting and have collated a series of articles on the topic over the years at this link . Often we’ve reflected on the ” the purpose of self-forecasting ” when observing unusual patterns. In 2024, Global-Roam partnered with a new startup to support wider access to high quality intermittent generator forecasts, and detailed understanding of performance. This new startup draws upon the experience of a highly capable and knowledgeable team who have extensive experience in operational forecasting and deep market understanding owing to prior roles in AEMO and working closely with with industry. The service provides participants with an opportunity to source accurate forecasts and avoid exposure to the risk of the biased forecasting that AER is monitoring. Going forward, FPP to the rescue? AER anticipates the upcoming Frequency Performance Payments (FPP) mechanism will deter self-forecasters from employing biases. FPP is the new incentive arrangement that compliments changes to the recovery of costs of regulation FCAS. FPP aims to compensate units for the provision of primary frequency response and penalise those who make unhelpful contributions to system frequency. Conservatively, AER remains vigilant for potential gaps in outcomes of the new mechanism, relative to expectations. Some behavioural change is anticipated (following today and with introduction of FPP). And we are still yet to even test the water with the FPP mechanism – the FPP non-financial operation period commences 9 December 2024. So we’ll probably have to wait and see whether the practice of biasing continues in any form. The AER plans to continue monitoring for biasing, carefully. The door to considering rule changes, if issues persist, remains open.",

    "title": "Wrap-up of price spikes in November 2024",
    "date": "04-12-2024 10:34:00 AM",
    "content": "The last week of November has a history of exhibiting extreme spot prices and this year, was no exception. There have been about 10 occasions in the market’s history when the last week of November has led to extreme prices. However, the one that sticks in my memory is before the NEM started, back in November 1997. Distant memory … For the first time in the market’s short history there was serious price separation between VIC and NSW in November 1997 due to the arrival of hot weather and a VIC to Snowy interconnector outage. During this time, the VIC forward market was at a premium to NSW; but those days are long gone. Consequently, NSW Government owned generators adopted the practice of also selling VIC contracts against the NSW node. The Victorian retailers welcomed their offers as an alternative to the stand-alone poor credit-rated, debt-laden Victorian private generators. However, when the VIC and NSW prices materially separated for the first time in 1997, the NSW generators were on the wrong side and reportedly lost about $12m across the two days of 25 and 26 November 1997. And now, November 2024 … Back to last week, extreme prices were evident in NSW on Wednesday 27 November and then again in bizarre fashion, on Friday 29 November. Looking at Wednesday you can use the play-back and shows how extreme prices were predicted from about 1:30pm through to 8:00pm, with demand predicted to reach 12,000MW amongst tight reserves. Such an event would have triggered the $600/MWh price administered cap. A spike occurred at around 3:00pm and a small amount of RERT (i.e. 65MW) was activated and then unregulated demand response caused demand to drop to about 11,000MW. All the remaining extreme prices then faded away. You can hit the play button and stop at any point, as well as scroll along using the scroll slider. Taking a look at Friday 29 November, this was a bizarre outlook with demand forecast to only reach less than 9,000MW while extreme prices were predicted to last from 7:00am through to 3:30pm. Another case where the administered price cap would have been triggered. However, as the day played-out, there was one half-hour spike of about $3,000/MWh at around 7:00am, but then the extreme prices faded away. The team at WattClarity have done some homework on the event and pointed out the AEMO dispatch engine “is forecasting possible outcomes based on one equation in predispatch, but a very different form of equation in dispatch, so the actual outcome in dispatch is that the constraint is not binding anywhere near as much, and so prices are remaining moderate.” As the playback chart shows below, after the initial spike it all faded away with no doubt many market players hanging onto each 5-minute period as it unfolded. Having a broader look at the quarter, the dials below show our probabilistic spot forecast along with the current quarterly average spot price below each dial. The observations are: QLD actual spot is currently sitting between our 50th and 75th percentile forecast, so nothing too remarkable to report and the higher location has been driven by riding on the back of NSW stronger spot prices. The forward market expects the average to drift down from $130.52/MWh to $124.75/MWh by the end of the quarter. The forward market peaked at $151.50/MWh early last week, but since then has been correcting downward rapidly. NSW is tracking in our top quartile of our forecast due to the extreme price days. Last week the forward market peaked at $169.50/MWh and has corrected downward as the threat of sustained high prices faded. The forward market also expects by the end of the quarter to move downward from $154.60/MWh to $145.50/MWh VIC has yet to flex it’s muscle this quarter so the average spot price is sitting in our bottom quartile at $42.88/MWh. The forward market has factored in a bit more strength in the spot by trading at $48.00/MWh by the quarter end. SA has also been relatively calm so far and is averaging a slight premium to Victoria at $48.49/MWh located just above our 25th percentile forecast. SA has also yet to flex it’s muscle in the spot and the forward market which hasn’t traded for more than a month, is sitting at $57.00/MWh TAS is tracking between our 25th and 50th percentile at $72.48/MWh comfortably above the last offered price by HydroTas of just under $58/MWh. By combining the last offer with the actual spot prices during the quarter puts the end of quarter estimate at around $72/MWh which almost matches the current average spot price. The key percentiles on the dials below are where the dial ranges from the 5 th to the 95 th percentiles, then the 25 th percentile is marked by the start of the dark segment, the 50 th is the white line between the dark segments, and finally the 75 th percentile is the end of the dark segment. The area charts below the dial show the journey of the forward price for the quarter since 1 July, and the label shows the current forward price.

    "content": "In this article, we present a summary of the extent to which supply-side energy availability was utilised for energy dispatch on the 27th of November 2024 in NSW. This was the NEM region where the greatest risk to supply was anticipated (recall the lack of reserve projections and events of the day ). Media announcements and changing network outage schedules indicate considerable work was done to modify, cancel or reschedule many network outages that were initially planned for the day to maximise transmission capacity and reserve levels . So, how did dispatch make use of the available supply mix? How much of what was offered got used? Aggregating by fuel type uncovers differences in use Bid and dispatch data was processed and aggregated to summarise totals for: Dispatch Availability (the black line at the top), Dispatch T arget , and The gap representing energy that was available but not dispatched, split into “ Curtailment ” (think power system restrictions such as network congestion), “ Priced out ” (think offered price was higher than the dispatching price). The method follows Allan’s approach as described in Renewable curtailment – forced and not quite so forced . Note that, in the case of VRE (wind and solar) units, economic ‘ offloading ‘ was the term used instead of priced out. For VRE we can think of this as ‘ offloading ‘ available energy to avoid dispatch, typically when the energy price to be earned is low. We’ve used priced out here because we also cover non-VRE supply sources that have controllable input fuel supply. On the chart there’s a fourth colour ( gray ) for when there was over-constrained dispatch ( OCD ). When OCD is resolved prices are redetermined by the dispatch engine. In such situations the price inputs that we require for determining the split are not available in the MMS. Update: Note that we can expect the non-dispatched portion of availability under OCD conditions to be “curtailment’ in all the foreseeable situations that we are aware of. Here’s the chart for eager eyes. We discuss each fuel type category below. But note, there’s more to know about what has gone into the data to prepare the chart. For this, see ‘ The details’ section at the bottom. Black Coal A considerable amount of capacity was offline (outages) and that’s not shown in the top panel of the chart. What is shown is the availability of the fleet that was in service , greater than 5,000MW typically, and peaking at 5,350 MW at 14:15. Below the availability is a slice for “Priced out”. This represents availability that was not dispatched due to the offer price being too high. This is the main portion of available energy not dispatched. There wasn’t very much curtailment at all throughout the period we have looked at. During the main OCD period coal unit dispatch hit its’s peak, only 43 MW below full availability (0.8% not dispatched, relative to availability). This was at interval 15:20. The chart ends at 20:00 but note that increase in aggregate target to almost 100%, again, by 20:00. This period aligns well with the absence of solar generation and a period of declining wind availability. Hydro The second biggest group, in terms of aggregate availability on the day, is Hydro. This category tended to (as with coal) see dispatch in line with bids. On other words, typically, only offloading occurred. There was a period where network constraints impacted supply and led to reduced targets for hydro units. This, appearing in blue, was 14:50 to 15:05. One example of curtailment in this period was at TUMUT3: Constraints impacting TUMUT3 included to avoid O/L Bannaby to Sydney West (39) on trip of Avon to Macarthur (17) line , and to avoid O/L Wagga to Yass (990) on trip of Wagga to Lower Tumut (051) line. These were binding. At 14:50 TUMUT3 had 474 MW priced at $17 499.92 (at RRN). The RRP was $17,500 so, ordinarily, this would have been dispatched as it was priced below. Yet that volume was curtailed due to the constraints. The price TUMUT3 would have needed to bid at to see dispatch of that volume was ( CPD price ) $ 1,370.39. This was a primary (but not the only) contributor to the total “curtailment” in the Hydro Panel at the 14:50 interval. Solar Solar units saw, predominately, curtailment when availability was not fully dispatched. 09:50 looks to be the only exception in the period we’ve assessed. There was a reasonably high amount of variability in availability (relative to total availability) between one interval and the next (often around +/-200 MW). This is indicated by the top black line going up and down frequently. Its attributed to cloud formations suppressing solar irradiance over NSW during the day. Wind The low point for wind availability was in the early afternoon, around 13:00. Even them, some network curtailment is apparent. Curtailment became considerable around 15:50 (possibly earlier, though we can’t say for sure given the OCD status of dispatch then). For example; At 15:50 only 36% of available wind generation was dispatched. By 16:30 curtailment had improved and continued at low levels into the evening. Prices were relatively subdued in the morning (in the order of 50 – 200 $/MWh). We do observe some minor level of ‘priced out’ MWs in the morning. This is unusual for VRE unless the price is low. For example, around 10:00 Flyers Creek Wind Farm had 30 – 50 MW occasionally priced at $17,500 during periods when the physical dispatching price was around $100 or below. Gas There was a key period of increased curtailment of natural gas from 14:50 to at least 15:05 (before OCD set in at 15:10). Gas generators running at the time included Tallawarra B (A was on a planned outage) , Colongra and Uranquinty. Battery Storage The same period of increased curtailment for gas units was seen for battery storage units. On the batteries, for the purpose of this assessment , we’ve only aggregated them when they weren’t charging . One could take a different approach, but this approach acts to say that the unit was unavailable to supply because it was charging. This is the reason for the bumpiness in availability on the chart. Diesel The diesel category saw full utilisation while prices were high, once it offered availability to the market. During the OCD period it was not dispatched from its availability of 20MW. Later, and still with availability, it was priced out. Prices We’d mentioned prices a lot in the article. The split to distinguish curtailment for priced out uses the physical dispatching price, but units earn the RRP for the energy generated on the spot market (adjusted by their MLF). Here is the RRP (at the RRN) over the analysis period. This can be different, at times, from the physical dispatching price. The details More like caveats, perhaps, these points are worth noting: NSW supply units are included. Supply from interconnectors isn’t included. On the batteries, we’ve only aggregated them when they weren’t charging, as mentioned above in the Battery Storage section. When a unit gets a target that is below the level it’s bid suggests it should be, that amount gets tagged as is ‘Curtailment’. Generally this is network curtailment but it can also emerge due to plant limitations such as ramp-up limitations in thermal units. We noticed this occurring in the coal fleet from time to time on the 27th. We’ve not disentangled the role of FCAS co-optimization in how the energy target may be reduced/raised to provide headroom for FCAS in the charts. From time to time NEMDE will determine that the most cost-effective solution is to adjust a unit’s ordinary energy target so that it can enable it in an FCAS market (lower energy to deliver a raise service or vice-versa for lower services). For example, when energy targets are lowered below the volume offered at the dispatching price to support an FCAS raise service, that reduction amount in the energy market will show up as ‘Curtailment’ in the approach we’ve used. In any case, it’s not an economic choice being made by the generator. Rather its result of the dispatch engine meeting the requirements of the network – namely the enablement of the required amount of ancillary services. Explicit separation of this will have to be for another day! Wholesale demand response wasn’t included in the study even though these loads act as a supply-side resources in dispatch. Non-scheduled units aren’t included. These units aren’t managed in central dispatch so we can’t detect and attribute changes in output to the categories used in this article. Yet non-scheduled units may still be price-sensitive.",

    "title": "High NSW price forecasts not materialising in dispatch, 29th November 2024",
    "date": "29-11-2024 02:04:00 PM",
    "content": "A curious phenomenon we’ve been watching with interest today, the 29th of November 2024, has been the somewhat persistent and alarmingly high predispatch price forecasts for NSW. If you had looked at the predispatch forecasts last night, you might have been shocked to see NSW Energy prices forecast to spend more or less the whole day at or near the MPC of $17,500. But, as the day progresses, apart from a short burst of actual volatility at 06:55 and 07:05, these predispatch forecasts have not ended up materialising in P5min forecasts or dispatch, disappearing seemingly “just in time”. Actual prices have been very moderate throughout the day. What’s going on? We’ll use ez2view to investigate. This screenshot is from ez2view at 11:00. Using the “Constraint Equations” widget, we can apply a filter to select just those constraints affecting the NSW region, then order by “Maximum MV” over a reasonable forecast horizon, in this case, 4 hours. Here, the first result is the N::N_CNSD_2 constraint, forecast to bind with a large maximum MV of -$18,134.52 in 4 hours. This is an outage constraint for a very small section of 330kV transmission in the ACT, the 3C line, Canberra – Stockdill, some kind of maintenance scheduled in advance, basically. The constraint aims to provide a “stability limit (Snowy-NSW) for fault of various location between Yass-South Morang area”. Here in “Constraint Dashboard” we can see that looking back to the actual dispatch outcomes, the marginal values of this constraint in dispatch show that it has been binding, but with continually moderate MV. Looking into the future P30 horizon here however, the predispatch outlook is quite dire, with very high MV! The final piece of the puzzle, looking at the “Plain English Translation” for this N::N_CNSD_2 constraint from “Constraint Dashboard” widget offers at least a partial explanation — the constraint RHS terms are vastly different in Predispatch vs Dispatch. Essentially, NEMDE is forecasting possible outcomes based on one equation in predispatch, but a very different form of equation in dispatch , so the actual outcome in dispatch is that the constraint is not binding anywhere near as much, and so prices are remaining moderate.

    "title": "Four NEM-related themes from COP29",
    "date": "29-11-2024 06:45:00 AM",
    "content": "I returned to the office on Monday after two and a half weeks in Azerbaijan, where I was attending the 29 th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference, better known as COP29. I would describe COP as a sprawling event with a very wide audience. The main conference area is a secured zone managed by the UN, featuring high-level intergovernmental negotiations, plenary sessions, side events, and an exhibition hall showcasing country pavilions. The conference runs for 11 days (with one rest day in the middle), with events practically on non-stop between 8 am to 9pm each day. My photos below should give an indication of some of the things you might expect to see on the ground at the conference. Clockwise from top left: the blue zone entrance, John Podesta opening the US pavilion, a media scrum for IAEA’s Rafael Grossi, a presentation by Octopus Energy’s Zoisa North-Bond, a press conference for German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, Matt Kean on a panel at the Australian pavilion, Keir Starmer delivering a national statement, and Andrew Forrest being interviewed at the Global Renewables Hub. For such a broad conference, my focus was fairly narrow: to gain a better global perspective on the successes and challenges that we’re currently seeing in Australia’s energy transition. In this article I will share four high-level reflections from my time at COP29 as they relate to current trends and developments in the NEM. 1. Uncertainty over the future of the IRA, and global capital flows The start of COP29 came just six days after the US election, where Donald Trump was re-elected as President, and Republicans secured a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. This news added significant confusion and uncertainty to the atmosphere at the conference, given that Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement in 2017 – a decision later reversed by Joe Biden in 2021. Many now expect that Trump will once again withdraw from the Paris Agreement and also repeal the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), one of Biden’s signature energy and climate policies. The IRA, introduced in August 2022, offers significant tax credits for US-based manufacturing, research, and development of renewable and nuclear energy projects. Latest estimates project that public and private investment in such projects had totaled $493B in the two years since its introduction, compared to $288B in the two years prior. The future of the IRA was a hot topic at COP29. John Podesta, leader of the US delegation on behalf of Joe Biden, struck a more optimistic tone about its future. At several speeches and media engagements, Podesta highlighted that the IRA is popular in many Republican-held states, with more capital flowing into red states than blue states. One of the US delegation members pointed me to this analysis from MIT and the Rhodium Group which shows that nine out of the top ten states benefiting most from IRA-related economic growth are Republican-held, where they are contributing single-digit percentage contributions to state GDP. As the Republican party holds only a slim majority in both houses, the theory/hope within the US delegation was that it may prove difficult to get all Republican congressmen and senators on board to repeal the act. For Australia, the fate of the IRA carries implications. With nearly half a trillion dollars deployed, the policy has shaped the flow of global capital for energy projects, particularly for capital earmarked for ESG investment. Some argue that this has driven down investment appetite for projects in the NEM, but has also driven up demand for critical minerals in Australia. This dynamic was the topic of a presentation by Quinbrook’s David Scaysbrook to the Queensland Energy Club that I attended back in October last year, but has also been well summarised in this piece by the AEC . Insufficient investment (and risk) appetite in new project development in the NEM was one of the the key catalysts for the introduction of the Capacity Investment Scheme in December 2022. 2. Data centres have started to navigate electricity markets (not the other way round) Co-location, co-location, co-location. That was my main takeaway from a roundtable discussion titled “Is the energy sector prepared for data centres and AI?” held at the UK Pavilion on Day 3. Amongst others, that session had a panel that included: Steve Smith – Chief Strategy and Regulation Officer at National Grid (UK); Antonia Gawel – Global Director of Sustainability at Google (USA); Jake Oster – Director of Energy Policy at Amazon (USA); and Yvonne McIntyre – Vice-President of Federal Affairs at Pacific Gas and Electric (USA); The consensus amongst the panelists, particularly between those representing Google and Amazon, was that co-location for data centres – with a BYO energy approach – is currently the most viable pathway through the grid connection process in many North American and European electricity markets. As I mention in my next theme below, a lack of spare transmission capacity appears to be a common thread in many international markets. Both Antonia from Google and Jake from Amazon made it fairly clear that dispatchable low-emissions generation (namely, nuclear and geothermal) was core to each company’s long-term energy strategy – given the expected load profiles of the hyperscale data centres that they are preparing to build, at least in the US. Both also made mention of each company’s investment and partnerships in pursuing SMR technology R&D, through Kairos Power and X-energy respectively. 3. Congestion woes are not a NEM-specific problem Over the two weeks, I had a number of discussions with other analysts and professionals who work within other electricity markets such as California, PJM, Germany and the UK – and it was somewhat comforting for me to hear that many characteristics of the congestion woes that we see in the NEM are not confined to our grid. In Germany they see significant north-south transmission congestion – stemming from a very high concentration of offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea. Within Germany’s market design, the cost of ‘re-dispatch’ is almost entirely passed on to end-consumers. The latest data here, shows that the German grid experienced 19 TWh of VRE curtailment in 2023, with €3.1B of these re-dispatch costs passed on to consumers. By comparison, we’ve calculated that the NEM had 3.7 TWh of semi-scheduled VRE curtailment throughout 2023 – but worth keeping in mind that the two countries have very different population sizes, industrial sectors, etc. These conversations reminded me of a quote from Paul Simshauser’s State of the Network address last year (available to watch on Youtube here ) – “When you go and study any electricity market over the world – if you see booms and busts associated with renewable generation, it comes down to hosting capacity and curtailment rates” . On Day 2 of the conference I attended a presentation by Zoisa North-Bond, the CEO of Octopus Energy Generation in the UK. In order to get around congestion, the company is pursuing some fairly novel retail products compared to what we see in Australia. One of these products is a special tariff for UK residents who live within defined postcodes near certain wind farms that the company operates. The energy user receives a 20% discount on their base rate when the wind speed exceeds 0m/s on-site, and a 50% discount when it surpasses 8m/s. I am yet to do a deep dive into how tariff works behind-the-scenes and how Octopus manages the hedging – but Zoisa stated that the tariff has sold out in every area where it is available. 4. Our firming challenges are unique From listening to national statements and chatting to delegates throughout the conference, it dawned upon me many times that Australia’s proposed transition to net zero is extremely unique. If you ignore countries that are yet to make inroads on electricity decarbonisation or have the benefit of interconnection to other jurisdictions, Australia is the only major developed nation transitioning its electricity system towards net zero with less than 10% of its generation currently coming from hydropower and/or nuclear. My view is that this fact (and please feel free to fact-check me and comment below) – combined with our world-leading rooftop solar penetration and hot summers – means that the NEM is fast becoming one of the most weather-dependent large electricity markets in the world. Because yes, even the state-of-charge of a battery has some relationship to weather patterns (in addition to the challenge of how accurately its owner can predict the future in order to manage finite storage levels). On a different note, I had one exchange with a representative from the UK and asked him what he sees as the next big transition challenge further down the road. His response was focused on how the UK’s gas transmission system will adapt to changing GPG dynamics due to increasing VRE. His first remark was along the lines of “I’m not sure everyone has grasped the fact that gas molecules don’t move as quickly as electrons” then, he added, “our gas transmission system was designed for winter, not summer… and it took over 20 years to build”. That exchange gave me flashbacks to this last autumn, where in Australia the east-coast gas system saw a significant pinch , whilst we were in the middle of a long-running wind drought . That’s not to say that those two situations were linked, but to say that those two issues could eventually compound if they simultaneously occurred again further along the transition. – With the learnings and musings above in mind, I left COP29 with a better understanding of how global challenges intersect with the NEM’s unique dynamics – but also, with many more questions and much more suspense about what lies ahead.",

    "title": "NSW seemingly squeaked through yesterday: Was it even that hot? Did batteries save the day?",
    "date": "28-11-2024 03:58:00 PM",
    "content": "The situation in NSW yesterday felt a bit like a rollercoaster ride. As the late afternoon approached, the supply-demand balance looked precarious – but thankfully, the lights stayed on and the run of extreme high prices eventually subsided before the late afternoon. Our team noted some interesting takes in the post-mortem analysis this morning – both on social media and from the traditional media. Many people were quick to draw conclusions, with these takes ranging from ‘why did the energy system struggle when it wasn’t even that hot’ to ‘batteries saved the day’ . Many of those types of conclusions didn’t pass our smell test – so this post is planned to be the start of a case study that will eventually examine (1) the demand-side factors, (2) supply-side factors, and (3) network factors. As time permits, myself or another member of our team will look to follow these analysis threads in Part 2. An unusual demand shape One of the most distinctive and tell-tale characteristics of what happened in NSW yesterday can be seen in the shape of market demand . Linton Corbet has produced the very handy interactive graph below for me (thanks Linton!). It highlights that the shape of demand in NSW yesterday was unusual because the peak occurred 1 to 2 hours earlier than what we would have expected. ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ How the shape of NSW market demand (a.k.a total demand) looked yesterday compared to the previous 30 days. Note: times shown are in NEM time. The ‘generation type x saved the day’ narratives that we typically observe after days like yesterday are usually over-simplistic. This is especially the case here, as the graph above suggests, that whatever potentially worse situation was avoided yesterday, can at least partially be attributed to one or more demand-side factors that altered the shape of demand yesterday. Demand-side factors In a future article, we hope to dig a bit more into the outages, bidding, constraints, etc. but in this post, I will start by taking an early look at weather and demand response – two factors that may have contributed to the shape of market demand that eventuated yesterday. Weather Was it even that hot yesterday? Yes, and unseasonably so. In fact, Ben Domensino determined that Penrith was the hottest place anywhere in the world at 10am (NEM time) yesterday morning. But importantly, the day began very hot in NSW – with temperatures in Sydney already above 30 degrees before 8am (NEM time). Air Temperatures around major load centres in NSW rose very quickly in the morning but experienced an early reprieve in the middle of the day. Note: times shown are in NEM time. Source: NEMreview Thankfully, temperatures started to subside just before midday for most parts of the region. It’s worth noting that there can be a delayed relationship between high temperatures and electricity demand for air-conditioning, because of the thermal lag experienced in buildings. Thermal lag describes the rate at which a material absorbs or releases stored heat. For materials with high thermal mass (e.g. concrete and brick) that delay is greater – for example, a standard 100mm thick slab of concrete has a thermal lag of approximately 4 hours. Wind and increased cloud clover coming in from the west are likely to have contributed to temperatures in NSW beginning to cool in the early afternoon (but would have also concurrently had some impact on rooftop solar generation – but we hope to explore that in a later article). Easterly moving cloud cover is likely to have contributed in helping to alleviate high temperatures in the middle of the day yesterday. Note: times shown are in NEM time. Source: Windy Demand response At around 3pm (NEM time), the AEMO published a press release stating that government agencies had been requested to reduce electricity grid consumption . A couple of our readers commented on that article that these protocols included turning off unused office equipment, adjusting air-conditioners, closing external facing blinds, etc. At around 3:47pm (NEM time), the AEMO published a market announcement that the RERT mechanism had been triggered for the region. Earlier today, Linton was able to forensically analyse the next-day public data, and determined that 65 MW of RERT was dispatched between the 15:50 and 16:45 dispatch intervals . RenewEconomy reported yesterday evening “AEMO said it had also dispatched contracts under its reliability and emergency reserve trader mechanism (RERT), and it is believed this included 75 MW of demand response capacity through Enel X.”. We will need to wait for the official AEMO reporting to be released to determine if this stated contribution by Enel X was the amount contracted (as opposed to dispatched) through RERT – but it is also possible that this stated figure is a combination of what was dispatched by Enel X through both RERT and the WDRM mechanism. WDRM in NSW provided small contributions during a period between the 14:45 and 16:45 dispatch intervals – but this contribution only hit a maximum of 14MW. Total registered WDRM capacity in NSW is just 33MW for the ‘energy’ commodity. Although there is a lack of visibility of behind-the-meter demand response, most people assume that there is a material amount of C&I customers on spot-exposed retail contracts (and a slowly growing number of residential users too) – these C&I users can hedge their load through a combination of physical and financial means. Depending on the primary purpose of the plant and operational protocols in place, the response times can vary significantly. The price spiked at or near the market cap ($17,500/MWh) for nearly an hour yesterday afternoon. Source: ez2view’s Trends More to follow…",

    "title": "QLD State Government ‘Electricity Maintenance Guarantee’ announced on 28th Nov 2024",
    "date": "28-11-2024 10:50:00 AM",
    "content": "A short, belated and back-dated article to point to this Queensland Government Media Statement from the new LNP Government that reads as follows: ‘ MEDIA STATEMENT: A Fresh Start for Queensland: Electricity Maintenance Guarantee to power Queensland’s future Published Thursday, 28 November, 2024 at 10:38 AM Treasurer, Minister for Energy and Minister for Home Ownership The Honourable David Janetzki A Fresh Start for Queensland: Electricity Maintenance Guarantee to power Queensland’s future Crisafulli Government flicks the switch on affordable, reliable and sustainable power with Electricity Maintenance Guarantee. The $1.4 billion Guarantee will boost energy reliability, putting downward pressure on energy costs for Queenslanders. Government-owned energy companies to have strict KPIs on new investment & performance under new accountability framework. GOC executive bonuses to be tied to reaching KPIs. The Crisafulli Government has taken the first step to delivering affordable, reliable and sustainable energy to power Queensland’s future, implementing an Electricity Maintenance Guarantee. A five-year base $1.4 billion Electricity Maintenance Guarantee will lock in investment for maintenance of power plants and create a new framework around investment, performance, and accountability for Queensland power assets. Executives at Queensland’s government-owned power companies will lose bonuses if they fail to comply with tough key performance indicators (KPIs) on maintenance, personal safety, process safety, and plant performance. Under the Guarantee, Stanwell, CS Energy, and CleanCo will be provided with investment certainty to deliver on their five-year maintenance programs, driving the effective maintenance, safety, and long-term reliability of Queensland’s power generators. Ultimately, the Electricity Maintenance Guarantee will give Queensland’s power grid more reliable energy generation and put downward pressure on power prices, by helping prevent disasters like the Callide explosion. The Callide C failure – which left unit C4 offline for more than 1100 days – caused widespread blackouts and contributed to Queensland’s 19.9 per cent electricity price hike last year, an increase three times the national average. The investigative Brady report into the incident condemned the organisation’s “failure to value and implement effective process safety practices”. Executives at Queensland’s three major energy companies pocketed over $2 million in performance bonuses over the past five years, in spite of the Callide failure. This included bonuses to CS Energy senior executives in the aftermath of the 2021 Callide C power plant explosion and cooling tower incidents in subsequent years. A 2020 shareholding ministers’ mandate prioritised cost savings and constrained the government-owned corporations’ investment strategies. New shareholding ministers are writing to the companies to implement the Guarantee as a new investment, performance and accountability framework. Treasurer David Janetzki said the Electricity Maintenance Guarantee was part of a Fresh Start for Queensland’s Future and delivered on a key commitment in the 100 Day Plan. “Under the Crisafulli Government’s Electricity Maintenance Guarantee, Government Owned Corporations will prioritise maintenance expenditure and have no excuse not to maintain assets,” Treasurer Janetzki said. “Despite Labor’s rivers of gold in revenue, they failed to allocate funds for adequate maintenance at Queensland power plants, leading to the Callide explosion. “We’re being clear to power executives: no KPI delivery, no bonus. “Inadequate maintenance was a key concern for years leading up to the Callide Catastrophe and the resulting power-price hikes cost Queenslanders every time they switched the lights on. “Our Electricity Maintenance Guarantee will ensure Queensland’s energy assets are never left in a state of neglect again. “The Electricity Maintenance Guarantee will make power executives accountable for performance, including clear KPIs for maintenance, personal safety, process safety, and plant performance. “The Crisafulli Government is focused on delivering affordable and reliable power for Queenslanders to drive-down cost pressures.” ENDS MEDIA CONTACT: Harry Spicer 0452 118 197’",

This screenshot was taken at 16:50, showing how NSW demand dropped considerably from forecast levels: At this early stage we didn’t observe the impact of RERT on NSW demand levels. This suggests (at this early stage in looking back) that any large loads that were activated had not been dispatched to reduce; RERT from such resources may have been ‘activated but not not used’.

    "date": "27-11-2024 02:45:00 PM",
    "content": "Sydney and other areas in eastern NSW are in the middle of a severe heatwave that’s making the end of spring feel more like the middle of summer. This early-season heat was so intense on Wednesday morning that the Sydney Basin briefly became the hottest place in the world. So, why is it feeling so hot this week? As clocks ticked over to 10am in Sydney on Wednesday, temperatures were already well well above 30°C in a number of the city’s suburbs. The highest running temperatures at the time were: 34.7°C in Richmond 34.5°C at Sydney Airport 34.2°C at Penrith By 11am, Penrith’s temperature had risen to a sweltering 36.5°C. This made Penrith not only the hottest place in NSW or Australia, but the hottest place in the world at that time. Image: Modelled maximum temperatures over eastern NSW on Wednesday. There are a few reasons why western Sydney became the hottest place in the world on Wednesday morning: A low pressure trough sitting over Australia’s eastern inland is feeding a warm air mass towards eastern NSW. The urban heat island effect combined with the foehn effect allowed the Sydney Basin to become warmer than surrounding areas of central eastern NSW. At 10am AEDT, Sydney has already been under the warming influence of the sun for hours, while other heat-prone areas of Australia, like WA and the NT, hadn’t had as much solar heating yet (the sun rises about 2-3 hours later in WA than NSW). While it is near the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere, the Northern Hemisphere is approaching winter and is therefore much cooler at this time of year. Other heat-prone areas in the Southern Hemisphere, such as Africa and South America, were at a cooler point in the day/night compared to Australia at 11am Sydney time. Image: Modelled surface air temperature at 11am AEDT on Wednesday, November 27, showing Australia’s standing out as a global hot spot. Source: ClimateReanalyzer.org Parts of Sydney are likely to reach close to 40°C on Wednesday and high volumes of atmospheric moisture will add to the muggy feeling of the day in parts of the Sydney Basin. This will be followed by a warm night and another hot day in the Sydney region on Thursday, although increased cloud, rain and thunderstorms will help limit the heating compared to Wednesday.

    "content": "As we’ve already noted, just before 10am this morning the AEMO announced their intention to initiate RERT negotiations in NSW this afternoon. And now, at around 11am, we’ve seen that the AEMO has just published a press release for the wider public: “AEMO is working with industry to manage electricity reliability during high-demand, heatwave conditions in New South Wales with major power stations unavailable due to forced and planned outages. We have flagged this risk to industry through market notices (lack of reserve) urging all available generation to return to service and restore all available powerlines across the grid to meet consumers’ electricity needs. In addition, AEMO is looking to procure additional reserves (reliability and emergency reserve trader, RERT) to best manage low electricity supply forecast this afternoon and early evening. We’re closely monitoring the situation and will keep stakeholders informed.” This comes after the AEMO published a separate press release 42 hours earlier , likely in response to extensive media coverage warning of possible ‘blackouts’ in NSW. — Below is an updated look at the forecast LOR conditions for this afternoon – where we are now in the P30 window. We can see that the forecast LOR3 condition reappeared for four hours this morning (between the 07:30 and the 11:30 forecast run). As we now move within the P30 window, we see that the forecast LOR3 condition reappeared for four hours this morning. Columns represent point in time, rows represent the recency of the forecast. Source: ez2view’s Forecast Convergence widget One contributing factor was an uptick in the demand forecast for NSW. In the forecast convergence line chart below we can see two groups of lines, with a roughly 200MW gap in between. The gap shows the change in forecasts beginning from the 07:30 run (coinciding with the reappearance of forecast LOR3 condition). Demand forecasts for this afternoon began rising from the 07:30 P30 forecast run. Source: ez2view’s Forecast Convergence widget Whilst a ~ 200 MW difference in demand is a relatively small change – especially when compared to total demand (which is currently forecast to peak at 12,019MW at 17:00 in NSW this afternoon, NEM time) – it does highlight how tight the supply-demand situation is currently looking in the region.",

As a result, the previously forecast Lack of Reserve Level 3 (LOR3) has been downgraded to a less critical Lack of Reserve Level 2 (LOR2). This improvement is largely due to the cancellation of transmission outages in the region.

According to the government’s press release: “The panel will look at National Energy Market (NEM) wholesale market settings to ensure the market promotes investment in firmed renewable energy generation and storage capacity into the 2030s and beyond. This is vital as electricity demand grows and ageing coal fired power stations exit the system.” The release goes on to state that the review will specifically be looking at reform initiatives that are likely to be implemented “once the current CIS tenders end in 2027, to ensure that investment pipeline remains strong” which may imply that the focus on the review may be on investment rather than operations. The four-person panel will be lead by economist Tim Nelson, who will depart his role with Iberdrola to head the review full-time.

    "content": "Given the tight supply-demand balance forecast for NSW and QLD on Monday 25th November 2024 , Tuesday 26th November 2024 , and Wednesday 27th November 2024 ( especially Wednesday , with more than 1000MW of load shedding currently forecast ), and even perhaps Thursday 28th November 2024, it’s worth revisiting the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view at 15:35 on Sunday 24th November 2024 to show what the current status is of generator outage plans: 1) For fully Scheduled units … noting that Semi-Scheduled units are invisible in this respect 2) For QLD and NSW only 3) filtering out units smaller than 200MW. To be clear, the filter used was this one: There’s some nuance in the detail that our ez2view clients can delve into, but for general consumption note the number of units with planned outages (i.e. grey cells) spanning those days above … with the NEM caught out by what’s perhaps sooner-than-expected hot weather forecast for NSW: Additionally note the unplanned outages at BW03 (a significant one, given the forecasts) and GSTONE5 and TNPS1. In terms of things to watch 1) Can any of those on forced outage be brought back in time for Wednesday? … seems unlikely, given the number of days set to go beyond Tuesday 2) Can the planned outage at ER03 be finished sooner so the unit is online for Wednesday? … probably slightly more chance than for the other units, but still difficult to do (no doubt AEMO will have spoken with Origin to ascertain this possibility). 3) Collective breaths will be held for the return to service for Kogan Creek on Wednesday morning, as well.

    "date": "24-11-2024 03:43:00 PM",
    "content": "A very quick post to look at one of the several reasons we are seeing LOR3 and LOR2 forecasts for NSW and Queensland respectively next Wednesday (27 November) . Previous posts from Paul (including this one ) have looked at a range of factors, including weather / demand, network outages and generation availability. This post just focuses on the last of these in a time-series fashion, as in “how did we get here?” – with a significant amount of thermal generation unavailable across the NSW and Queensland fleets. Looking at thermal units of at least 150 MW capacity – all the coal-fired plus the larger gas-fired units – nearly one-third of this appears to be unavailable for the first few days of the week. The first chart shows how the MTPASA forecast view of availability for these units has evolved over the last couple of months, and particularly the last couple of weeks, picking dates on which there have been material changes: From looking fairly benign up to the end of October, there have been a series of downward steps in projected available capacity in AEMO’s MTPASA runs. The next chart, concentrating on 27 November, shows the unit outages contributing to these downward steps at each selected forecast date: We see a real mix of: planned outages which have been “on the books” throughout the leadup period (Braemar units, Tallawarra, Bayswater 2 and Tarong 2) A more recent planned outage emerging for Callide B1 – and a fairly late-notice extension of an ongoing planned outage of Kogan Creek, which has now changed to being due back on 27 November in the lastest run charted (fingers crossed) Slippage in return dates for two NSW coal-fired units which are completing longer term outages (Eraring 3 and Vales Point 6), and Forced outages emerging over the last two weeks at Bayswater 3, Gladstone 5 and Tarong North Lets hope one or more of these come back earlier than planned and that there are no further outages leading into next week. As Paul says, that’s all for now. ================================================================================================= About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

    "content": "When I wrote ‘It’s back! Forecast LOR3 for NSW on Monday 26th November 2024’ on Wednesday, I did note that we were not going to religiously post articles at each update of the AEMO forecasts. Rather, we provided some tips via ‘Here’s a few things to watch, w.r.t. the forecast tight supply-demand balance in NSW (and QLD) for early next week’ . In the >36 hours since that article on Wednesday there have been a number of cycles – but most importantly we note that the forecasts for LORx on Tuesday 26th November 2024 have been less strident in recent times … with the downwards progression in severity highlighted here in a snapshot from the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view at 09:35 on Friday 22nd November 2024 : There are essentially two step changes downwards in the forecasts for LORx for next Tuesday, as noted here (all times in NEM time ): Step Change Down #1 – between 12:00 and 13:00 We see above that these are the two runs that straddle the step change down from forecast LOR3 (in the run for 12:00) and the forecast LOR2 (in the run for 13:00). As Allan noted in this comment here yesterday afternoon, it appears that the AEMO did indeed remove its permission for the line 17 outage : 1) which was reflected in the ‘N-X_11_17’ constraint set . 2) which relates to an outage on the Dapto-Sydney South (11) 330kV line* and Avon-Macarthur (17) 330kV line ; * noting that the line 11 is already out in the the ‘N-DTSS_11’ constraint set 3) This change appears to have been made at 12:48 on Thursday 21st November 2024. PS1 … update with more detail Initially it appeared yesterday that the outage had not just been deferred … i.e. it appeared that the outage had been totally cancelled (in terms of assessment for invocation at some future point in time). One might think of this, perhaps, in terms of ‘back to the drawing board’ in terms of whatever work TransGrid was planning to do on that line with summer fast approaching? However in an update at 08:55 on Friday 22nd November 2024 , it appears that the outage has been re-submitted: 1) With the new plan being: (a) Outage starts from 05:00 on Wednesday 27th November 2024 ; (b) Outage ends 17:00 on Saturday 30th November 2024 . 2) Though this appears not to have been approved yet? Step Change Down #2 – between 22:00 and 23:00 We see above that these are the two runs that straddle the step change down from forecast LOR2 (in the run for 22:00) and the forecast LOR1 (in the run for 23:00). Now, there may well have been other changes, but it was easy to find this step change increase in forecast Wind UIGF for NSW for Tuesday afternoon/evening 26th November 2024 (i.e. increasing by ~500MW to ~1,000MW) that would have been one contributing factor: … but remember what comes down (i.e. forecast LORx) can also go up, so keep watching this space.",

It’s been given the project reference ERC0403 by the AEMC, with materials available at the sub-site here . The key dates appear to be as follows: Date Milestone 1st October 2024. On 1 October 2024, the AEMC received a rule change request from Delta Electricity to amend the National Electricity Rules and National Gas Rules. This is what we noted (a week later) in ‘Delta Electricity submits ‘relatively urgent’ Rule Change Proposal for December 2024 credit support deadline’ . 17th October 2024. On 17 October 2024, Delta Electricity resubmitted the rule change request to clarify that the proposed changes only relate to the National Electricity Rules. 24th October 2024 On 24th October, the AEMC produced this Consultation Paper: At this point the AEMC commenced its process ( their news release is here ), noting that: ‘Stakeholders can object to this expedited process by lodging a written objection with us by 7 November 2024 .

    "date": "20-11-2024 07:28:00 PM",
    "content": "There’s been a bit of yo-yo-ing with the forecast LOR3 condition in NSW for Tuesday afternoon-evening 26th November 2024 : 1) With our latest (and perhaps last?) update of AEMO’s Market Notice updates noting ‘It’s back! Forecast LOR3 for NSW on Monday 26th November 2024’ 2) Whilst ‘risk of load shedding ’ may well be in the media headlines in the coming days, it’s important to remember that: (a) these types of forecasts are designed to elicit a market response … so, as noted in earlier articles, we’re hoping for that. (b) The broader sense is that (whether LOR3 or LOR2 eventuates) it seems almost certain that it will be quite tight, and hence quite volatile i. both on Monday 25th November 2024 ii. also on Tuesday 26th November 2024 If our team has time, we’ll endeavour to post some snippets here on WattClarity in terms of what unfolds … but, for those with their own licence to ez2view , here’s some things we suggest you keep an eye on…. (A) Watching constraints on Interconnectors! Let’s start by remember that ‘An inter-regional interconnector refers to *the whole of* the transmission path between RRNs’ ( not just the bit of kit that hangs over the region boundary). A1) Watching the VIC1-NSW1 interconnector In recent weeks we’ve already written about the number of times that VIC1-NSW1 interconnector is heavily constrained. 1) for instance the ‘N-MNYS_5_WG_CLOSE’ Constraint Set has been a particular culprit, because of the effect it has on some 330kV flow paths from southern NSW to Sydney … including via the ‘N::N_CTMN_2’ constraint equation, which is one of many constraint equations in that set. 2) when that happens, NSW can’t be supported by surplus capacity in VIC, SA or TAS – so relying on supply capacity locally, and possibly* in QLD as well. To take a look forward at what might be on the cards for Monday 25th and Tuesday 26th November, here’s a Gantt-chart style view of the scheduled invocation of a filtered list of Constraint Sets in the ‘Constraint Sets’ widget in ez2view : Now in the filter applied here, we’re only looking at outage-related constraint sets that relate to network outages on the 330kV network between southern NSW and the Regional Reference Node. … in Allan’s prior article ‘What’s happening around Wagga?’ he explains why these are important. In the view above, we see three particular constraint sets that are worth highlighting as follows: Constraint Set #1) The the ‘N-MNYS_5_WG_CLOSE’ Constraint Set In the article ‘Reviewing the ‘N-MNYS_5_WG_CLOSE’ Constraint Set, as a major factor in recent northern volatility’ we took a focused look at this one. In the snapshot above we see that (currently) the expected end of the outage is Monday afternoon 25th November 2024 : 1) interestingly, that article showed an earlier snapshot showing the expected end of outage being Tuesday afternoon 26th November 2024 2) so, thankfully, that outage looks to be running ahead of initial schedule (perhaps with a ‘hurry up’ delivered via these forecast LOR3 warnings from the AEMO?) Constraint Set #2) The the ‘N-DTSS_11’ Constraint Set There’s a gantt chart entry for the ‘N-DTSS_11’ constraint set … which: 1) Has not (yet?) featured as heavily in articles here 2) But relates to an outage on the Dapto to Sydney south (11) 330kV line ; and 3) Is currently scheduled to extend to Friday evening 29th November 2024. Constraint Set #3) The the ‘N-X_11_17’ Constraint Set More ominously (perhaps?), there’s also a Gantt chart entry for the ‘N-X_11_17’ constraint set … which: 1) Has not (yet?) featured as heavily in articles here 2) But relates to an outage on the Dapto-Sydney South (11) 330kV line and Avon-Macarthur (17) 330kV line ; and 3) Is currently scheduled: (a) to only commence on Tuesday morning 26th November 2024 ; (b) and extend until Friday evening 29th November 2024. … one wonders if this outage will find itself moved? Those with the ‘Notifications’ widget configured could even set an alert watching it become invoked (or even checking, say 24 hours out, that it’s forecast to be invoked). A2) Watching the VIC1-NSW1 interconnector Worth remembering that for periods in and around 8th May 2024 , the QNI interconnector was also limited … so NSW was really ‘on its own’ there. We’ve not, at this point, looked at potential limitations on QNI via constraint sets at all… but that would be worth keeping an eye on. (B) Watching demand Moving right along, we’ll use a collage of two copies of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view with NSW on top of QLD for a change*, looking successive forecasts for ‘ Market Demand ’ in both regions: * well, NSW did win State of Origin in 2024. As noted on the image, we see that NSW forecast ‘Market Demand’ (at just over 11,000MW) is much higher than any neighbouring days – whilst still being a long way below the all-time maximum. (C) Watching available generation … for Scheduled units On the assumption that VIC1-NSW1 flows will be heavily constrained at periods of stress (e.g. because of outages on those 330kV backbone lines) we’ve filtered the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view here to look at any fully scheduled* units above 300MW in size, using this filter: * noting the invisibility of Semi-Scheduled units in terms of MT PASA DUID Availability data) That reveals this list: Now I’ve highlighted the two days in question and would encourage ez2view users: 1) to keep an eye on how the planned outages marked unfold … does the AEMO step in to recall any ? 2) … or any other unplanned outages (in addition to BW03 ) that emerge. (D) Watching energy-constrained availability … for Semi-Scheduled units In another view of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view we flip NSW and QLD to look at UIGF for Wind in each region. As noted on the image, it’s looking like a decidedly modest contribution from wind farms across QLD and NSW during the critical period … noting that network constraints might mean performance is lower still than capability. I have not bothered to flip for Solar units, because we all know they won’t be producing after sunset … what would be interesting is to see how they perform in the couple hours leading into sunset (e.g. whether affected by rainfall similar to what we’ve seen the past couple of days?). That’s where we will leave it for today …",

    "title": "A question about (currently) planned outages for Eraring Power Station through until (currently planned closure) in August 2027",
    "date": "18-11-2024 04:07:00 PM",
    "content": "Most readers here will remember that it was on 23rd May 2024 that the announcement was finally made that the Eraring Power Station would remain open until August 2027 (i.e. a 2 year extension on a stated closure date, to that point, of August 2025) … though perhaps fewer will remember the caveat that the extension might actually be for as long as 4 years, to August 2029. … we noted this at that time in ‘Eraring Power Station closure delayed by 2 years (or maybe 4?)’ . That’s roughly 6 months ago today. I’ve had a question that’s puzzled me for a while – and wonder if some more learned readers here can help me out, please? (A) A look forward, in MT PASA DUID Availability In our article on 23rd May , the first image included was one of the ‘MT PASA DUID Availability’ widget inside of ez2view , showing (to that point) what had been the expected trend of availability across the four units at the Eraring Power Station. Given that it relates to my question, I thought I’d start this article with a similar snapshot of this morning’s snapshot from 09:30 ( NEM time ) for the Eraring Power Station: Note that this was too early for the first data update from the AEMO (notionally for 09:00 but often actually published after that point) for this data set, so the current run we see is the update for 18:00 on Saturday 16th November 2024. I’ve set the ‘previous run’ to be 1st April 2024 so that the prior closure date of August 2025 can be clearly seen. 1) Obviously there are near-term changes in availability (such as due to forced outage) … but that’s not the focus of this article 2) Rather, looking forward from August 2025 to August 2027 we can see the aggregate profile shows two drops (but only 2?!) in availability for planned outages over that additional 2 year period: (a) There’s a lengthy planned outage for Unit 4 from September 2025 to November 2025; (b) And there’s a shorter planned outage on Unit 1 through April 2026 … shorter, but still (at ~4 weeks) still pretty significant. We wondered about the extent to which these current plans for planned outage might continue to evolve over time … and specifically if there’d need to be any planned outages on Units 2 and Units 3 , given the closure date is a little under 3 years away from now ? Our interest in the above question is through several lenses, including: Lens #1) This is the first case that comes to mind for me where a coal-fired station’s had a clearly stated closure date (presumably around which has been built maintenance plans – including outage plans visible in the 3-year MT PASA DUID Availability time horizon), to find that service life significantly extended: (a) in that sense (for instance) the hush-hush ‘safety net’ agreement struck between the Victorian Government and Yallourn is different, as that might not have changed outage plans noticeably within the MT PASA DUID Availability time horizon. (b) but it may be that we see more of these types of things in future, if delays in development of sufficient firming capacity continue? (c) I wondered how long it might take (i.e. was 6 months since the extension announcement enough?) to put in place outage plans for the extended service life? Lens #2) With a 2 year extension (but notably also a further 2-year option), my rusty engineering brain is interested to see how this type of arrangement flows through to outage plans. Lens #3) We’re also curious how this decision (and what might(?) be still-to-be-finalised outage plans) impact on hedge contract prices and the like … (B) Backwards and forwards… So, with the above in mind, let’s take a look at a 14-year time series of Availability at each unit at Eraring Power Station … back ~10 years of actuals and forward ~3 years of projections. All four units We’ll start with this trend of aggregate availability across all four units from 1st January 2014 to 1st January 2028: One of the first thing that jumped out at us in the above was the period of about 4 weeks late in 2016 when all 4 Eraring units … for those who are unfamiliar, that’s quite unusual! My outsourced memory failed me on that one, so we fell into a bit of a rabbit hole in investigating and so have posted this (incomplete record) belatedly . Eraring unit 1 (2014 to 2028) Now we’ll unbundle the trend above, looking at each unit in turn – starting with ER01: This unit had a major outage in the second half of 2022: 1) 122 days in total (including a failed RTS), with the unit back online from 19th December 2022 2) a quick scan of WattClarity revealed no articles specifically tagged with the station from around that time that might have explored this outage 3) but I don’t have time to fall into another rabbit hole today. We noted above that this unit has an outage (roughly 4 weeks) planned from 3rd April 2026 … which would mean 3 years + 4 months between ‘longer’ outages . Eraring unit 2 (2014 to 2028) Here’s the same trend for Unit 2: This unit’s last ‘major’ outage late in 2023: 1) For 82 days in total 2) Back online for 24th November 2023. With no planned outages on the horizon out till the mooted closure date of August 2027, (and skipping over the 23-day outage to 25th May 2024 … which perhaps we should not? ) that would be a duration approaching 4 years at closure . Eraring unit 3 (2014 to 2028) Here’s the same trend for Unit 3: Note that this unit’s currently on outage: 1) Since 26th August 2024 ; and 2) With expected return to service Friday 29th November 2024. There’s no further outages planned in the ~3 years from that point until mooted closure. Eraring unit 4 (2014 to 2028) Here’s the same trend for Unit 4: We see that: 1) the last outage of length was in April 2024: (a) 41 days in total (b) Back online for 1st May 2024 2) … and we noted (above) a planned outage (from September 2025 to November 2025) 3) So, after that, a ~2 year period with no outage planned till closure in August 2027. (C) When were those outage plans added? Utilising the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view we can see that the slated outages for ER01 and ER04 prior to closure in August 2027 were added into the Ordinarily we’d note that this widget can be used to ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to ‘see that other dimension of time ’ … but, in this case, it’s the horizontal that’s more interesting. As highlighted, it shows that the two outages added for the future were added into the AEMO data set on Friday 13th September 2024 : 1) That’s approaching 4 months after the extension announcement. 2) During that interim period, I imagine the generator (Origin Energy) would have been busily updating their asset management plans are arranging the necessary resources (people and plant) to complete the required outages. 3) As noted above, I wonder if there are any other planned outages that are not yet finalised but which will pop up in the MT PASA DUID Availability data set in the weeks ahead? With the above in mind, we’ll keep watch on how this changes in the future…",

    "title": "NEM Mainland frequency patterns – historical overview from 2024",
    "date": "15-11-2024 03:46:00 PM",
    "content": "We’ve been keeping a close watch on NEM mainland grid frequency lately, using the data from Global-Roam’s high speed frequency monitor located in Brisbane. And we’ve been spurred by a number of questions and comments to look back at historical frequency patterns, including one (via LinkedIn ) related to Paul’s article NEM Mainland Frequency drops below the NOFB, on Tuesday 12th November 2024 . It’s not the first time we’ve done this at WattClarity. For example we reported on the patterns in 2021. That analysis, and more, can be found at the Trend of Frequency Performance page. In this overview standing at the tail end of 2024, we take an updated longitudinal look-back at how frequency has changed over the years. In doing so, we aim to obtain a good overview of mainland frequency extents and typical ranges, helpful to contextualise any follow-on investigations into NEM frequency. Narrow, then wide, now narrow Using the 4-second data we’ve processed frequency in 2011, and from 2017 to 2024 (year -to-date). The following chart summarises the frequency in those years by month as a density plot (number of measurements in a bucket divided by total number of measurements). Narrow In 2011 we can see the frequency distribution was tight, typically well within 49.9 and 50.1 Hz. Wide By the time 2017 came about that tight distribution of mainland frequency had slipped. Relative to 2011, many more 4-second readings were outside the 49.9 to 50.1 range (not seen in 2011) and even outside the normal operating frequency band (NOFB) of 49.85 to 50.15 ( represented by the vertical lines on the chart below ). Back in 2017 Kate Summers highlighted the regulatory settings that were driving this slippage in Fast Frequency Service – Treating the symptom not the cause? Narrow It wasn’t until November and December of 2020 that the frequency distribution showed signs of a tighter domain around 50 Hz. This is attributed to the introduction of mandatory primary frequency response . Since 2021 the tighter distribution has persisted. However, the distributions aren’t quite the same as we uncovered the 2011 data. There’s a dip about 50Hz that was not present in 2011. *Note that distributions for January 2020 and October – December 2019 are omitted due to data quality. Less time spent at 50 The next two charts take the monthly distributions and plot them individually, year-by-year. These distributions (for the highlighted month and year) are coloured by season. Additionally, grey lines for the other years are drawn to help compare. But before we get to the chart, let’s go over a sample, the Januarys, to highlight some patterns that are emerging. We see the patterns of the January months are evident in the other months in the chart below. However, a weaker signal appears to be evident in the winter months. At the extremities When we cut out the incidences at typical frequencies, performance at the extremes becomes more visible. The distributions of the first chart (above, top) are clipped, producing the chart below. For this chart, note the y-axis is the count rather than the density. In all years charted we see instances of frequency below the lower end of the normal band Events in recent memory include the the s ignificant power system event on the 13th of February, 2024 , driving that month’s performance. Yet recalling the distributions of 2017 to 2020 nowadays grid frequency remains in a much better place comparatively. There is a skew to lower frequencies One reason for this, that may lead to further analysis, is the role and prevalence of semi-dispatch caps on semi-scheduled units – when these caps are in force affected units are permitted to deviate below their energy target and not above it. Therefore, there will be a tendency for under supply of energy when semi-dispatch caps are on (associated with inaccuracies in dispatch availability forecasts), leading to a drag on frequency. As more and more VRE comes into the NEM this effect has the potential to play a greater role in the future. There is more to uncover in the outliers when frequency is outside the NOFB, as well as trends of frequency within the NOFB. And let’s not to forget Tasmanian frequency performance. We’ll aim to delve into these aspects in the future.",

    "title": "Snippets from AEMO’s summer readiness briefing for 2024-25",
    "date": "14-11-2024 04:55:00 PM",
    "content": "The summer readiness briefing for the NEM 2024-25 summer was presented by AEMO EGM Operations, Michael Gatt and Head Communications Meteorologist · Weatherzone Ashleigh Madden. The briefing branched into two main themes: Weather and Climate (Weatherzone), Gas and Electricity (AEMO). The recording and slides will be circulated to attendees by AEMO in due course. There was more content in the presentations, so readers will do well to access the full slide deck (and recording) when it becomes available. Until then, here are some highlights we captured. In the gas and electricity segment AEMO addressed a comprehensive set of elements that contribute to its readiness plans Notable aspects boxed in red. The network A host of maintenance or commissioning works in Victoria are flagged as contributing to a greater number of high impact outages over summer in the VIC region. Generation Availability Several large generating units are taking planned outages spanning the November and December period. The return to service dates will be closely monitored as delays could compromise availability in January. Extreme demand There is an increased likelihood of demand records (both minimum and maximum). The record QLD peak demand of last summer ( on 22nd January 2024 ) was noted as an example that peak demand could climb higher this summer. In addressing the supply reliability shortfalls identified for this summer in the recent ESOO, AEMO noted that it will procure interim reliability reserves (pay for availability) to firm up the shortfalls in SA and NSW, and short notice RERT will be used to cover the 10MW gap in VIC. Gas Powered Generation (GPG) GPG will be crucial in providing peak generation capacity to the NEM this summer, but how much and when is linked to uncertainties in supply from VRE, demand levels and the utilisation of new large-scale batteries. There is reduced volume of gas production due to facility maintenance (compared to last year) meaning that storage refilling will take longer. I also interpreted related points as there being potential for higher gas prices as under peak GPG utilisation periods there could be a possible need to draw down upon gas storage levels, to supplement that from production facilities. On the weather and climate outlook for the summer, highlights include El Nino-Southern Oscillation Warm sea surface temperatures and La Nina -like conditions (index officially neutral, but on the low side). This increases the likelihood of heavy rainfall, and thunderstorms. Increased number of tropical cyclones in QLD (3.8 vs 3 typically per season). We know from experience these events can bring flooding and trees down over powerlines. Temperatures Looking to December and beyond, temperatures across the NEM are anticipated to be generally about average or cooler with a slightly lower numbers of days in extreme heat. This is associated with the southern annular mode projected to be more-often positive in the summer, leading to high pressure systems sitting further north. This would be bringing cooler south-easterly winds to southern states. It was also noted that these climate conditions have the potential to lead to heatwaves if it sits in the right location for extended periods. And looking at the maximum temperature charts below, parts of SA (being coloured light red) might expect warmer maxima than typical. Notably, the number of days at or over 35°C at Ipswich, QLD, is anticipated to be more than typical – 20 days, relative to an average of 17.8. Bushfire risk above average in some Australian locations Based on the analysis for spring 2024, key regions in the NEM are western VIC and southeast SA, and inland QLD. The recording and slides will be circulated to attendees by AEMO in due course. Update (25 November) – Presentations available AEMO report the following: “The presentation slides from the AEMO and Weatherzone (DTN) presentations, along with the meeting recording, are now available on AEMO’s website: AEMO | Summer operations 2024-25 “.",

    "content": "We’ve noted this morning that ‘AEMO directs 4 units on in Victoria, to cover System Strength shortfall’ … noting that, at that time, there were 3 coal units in Victoria offline. Shortly afterwardsL: 1) we noted ‘Loy Yang A2 joins three other coal units in VIC offline’ ; and 2) we speculated the the short-notice outage of Loy Yang A2 was the trigger for the AEMO direction (i.e. dropping number of coal units in VIC down from 7 down to 6). How often is it that only 6 coal units in VIC are online? I wondered how often it’s been that the Victorian region had a low of 6 coal units online : 1) I need to pretty a chart up a bit before publishing, 2) But the short story is that it’s happened quite often . So why the direction? So, we wondered, why the direction (especially for 4 units to replace the System Strength from the ‘missing’ coal units)? Others have asked the same question – and smarter people than i have pointed to the AEMO document ‘Victorian Transfer Limits Advice – Outages’ (from Oct 2024), and specifically the required combination for direction with an outage on the Moorabool to Sydenham line. See page 68/87 copied in here, with the 4th row highlighted … which turns out to be the combination of units directed with only 6 coal units online in VIC: The outage of the Moorabool to Sydenham line Rounding out this short story is this snapshot from ez2view at the 13:50 dispatch interval ( NEM time ) with two widgets shown: 1) At the top is the ‘ Constraint Sets ’ widget … (a) filtered down to constraint sets referencing both network substations (b) revealing just one constraint set 2) The ‘V-MLSY_NOEMTT_R’ constraint set is then expanded in the ‘Constraint Set Details’ widget underneath … note that we’ve seen this outage before in prior articles here. We see that this constraint set: 1) Became invoked yesterday late morning (Wednesday 13th November 2024 at 11:35 NEM time ) 2) Is currently expected to remain invoked out until Wednesday 20th November 2024 at 19:00 That’s all for now…",

Perhaps a mistake in a switching sequence?’ … which led me (on Wednesday morning) to the update ‘Victorian coal plant goes offline after leak in boiler tube’ by Peter Hannam here: Using ‘Next Day Public’ data… Utilising ez2view with ‘Next Day Public’ data this morning, we quickly take a look at each of the four units. YWPS1 … offline planned outage As noted with the snapshot from ‘Generator Outages’ widget in the first article , this unit is offline on a planned outage with expected return to service on Sunday 17th November 2024 . So note that: 1) it played no role in what happened on Tuesday 12th November 2024 . 2) I also wonder if this unit is also amongst those Peter includes as ‘up and running by tomorrow morning’ noting: (a) The noted return to service is some days away still (b) Albeit that the MT PASA DUID Availability data for this week is stale, not having been updated since Saturday 9th November for 18:00. YWPS2 … tripped, but back online later Tuesday As captured in this snapshot from the alert triggered by the ‘Notifications’ widget in ez2view , YWPS2 began its return to service in the period just prior to 16:55 NEM time : Reviewing the trend of data, we see this unit dropped from 367MW (InitialMW) to 22MW (FinalMW) in the dispatch interval ending 10:45 NEM time , thereafter to 1MW (FinalMW) at 10:50 and then to 0MW at 10:55. 1) So slower than for YWPS4: (a) … though perhaps still inevitable that it was coming offline? (b) Will need to think of the effect on frequency drop if a not-so-rapid as YWPS4 decline 2) That’s why the time offline appeared to be later than for YWPS4 in the ez2view ‘Notifications’ widget snapshot included at the bottom of this first article . We can see this in the snapshot from the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view focused on this period (looking back 1 hour): This image is now populated with ‘next day public’ data – and nothing in the bidding to the 10:50 dispatch interval anticipated that this unit would come offline. There was a rebid that arrived at AEMO at 10:49:30, however (taking effect for 10:55 given Gate Closure #2 ), that noted: ‘Adj avail bands portfolio redist YWPS OOS SL’ We see this here: YWPS3 … offline for tube leak The case for this unit is different (as noted by Peter Hannam above), in that this unit commenced reduction in load at ~08:35 NEM time on Tuesday morning. We can see this in the snapshot from the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view focused on this period (looking back 3 hours): In this case, there was a rebid received at the AEMO at 08:53 noting: ‘Adj avail PASA tube leak SL’ We see this here: YWPS4 … tripped, but not yet back online (as at 06:15 Wednesday 13th November 2024) With this one, we see this unit dropped from 357MW (InitialMW) to 0MW (FinalMW) in the dispatch interval ending 10:45 NEM time … hence the ez2view ‘Notifications’ widget snapshot included at the top of this first article . We can see this in the snapshot from the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view focused on this period (looking back 1 hour): Similar to the case for YWPS2 … and arriving at the AEMO simultaneously (i.e. 10:49:30) that noted: ‘Adj avail bands portfolio redist YWPS OOS SL’ We see this here: Note that, as we hit publish here, this unit remains offline on Wednesday morning 13th November 2024 .",

    "date": "12-11-2024 12:56:00 PM",
    "content": "Editor’s Note – This is the text of a speech presented by Philippe Orhan at All-Energy in Melbourne on Thursday 24 th October 2024. Philippe’s talk was the fourth of 4 presentations that Paul noted in his article ‘‘Operating in the NEM’ … from All Energy 2024’ . With the publication of Philippe’s articles, WattClarity ® now features articles from all four presenters from that session. Neoen’s journey in the NEM Neoen’s journey in the NEM started 12 years ago. As a developer of exclusively renewable energy (with a focus on large scale solar, wind and storage technologies), Neoen has adopted a “develop-to-own” model , keeping ownership in the long-term, operating our assets on the various markets we are active in. In Australia, this strategy led Neoen to be operating a diverse portfolio of over 2GW of clean energy, over all mainland states of the NEM. We most recently made our entry into Western Australia and the WEM, which has highlighted some interesting specificities of both markets. While the core of Neoen’s activities was focused on the development and delivery of projects, this focus gradually shifted towards the intricacies of operating a large renewables portfolio in the NEM . While the portfolio grew in size and diversity, a few key decisions shaped the way we are interacting with the NEM today. First, the establishment of our own 24/7 Operations Control Centre, based in Canberra in 2018. The team is working round the clock, monitoring the entire portfolio in the NEM and the WEM, managing the bidding into the market. As Pan highlighted in his presentation , the NEM is a highly volatile market. The experience that this team is accumulating over time, as well as their ability to react quickly to unforeseen events, is critical to the success of our operations. Given the early development of Neoen’s storage portfolio, they have accumulated an unparalleled experience in battery operations. The second milestone relevant to today’s topic is the development of our internal automated bidding algorithm. If you’ve read Alex’s article on big batteries revenues , you’ll easily understand that operating batteries manually in the NEM would prove inefficient. Keeping this competency internally is critical in developing a tool that is tailored to the needs of the Operations Control Center and the specificities of Neoen’s portfolio. Data in the NEM : opportunities With this context in mind, this presentation endeavours to share some insights we learned along the way, and shed some light on the unique role of data in this market and the opportunities and challenges a market participant faces. Data is central to the way the NEM is operating, and surprisingly the approach is very different from other electricity markets in the world. A few aspects to keep in mind : An unparalleled amount of data available Overall, transparency is the norm of this market, with AEMO making available to market participants virtually all the data they can dream of. AEMO is releasing every 5 minutes all outputs of the NEM Dispatch Engine, which include : (a) Usual market characteristics such as demand, price, generation mix, etc (b) State of all network constraints (c) Facility-level details, allowing participants to see their competitors production (d) Prices are even computed over the forecast horizon on a range of scenarios This data is available not only for the current dispatch interval, but also over the P5 and predispatch horizons. It’s easy to take this data for granted, but this level of transparency is far from the norm on electricity markets . Most markets will release only aggregated data, and you can forget about short-term forecasts. An efficient real-time approach As a consequence of the real-time nature of the NEM, all this data is released in real-time to market participants , allowing them to quickly react and adapt to any changes in the market or with their plants physical capabilities. After the start of an interval, AEMO usually releases all this data within around 30 seconds, and accepts bids until 15 seconds before the start of the next interval (some call this ‘ Gate Closure #2 ’). NEMDE is therefore collecting data, solving the market (again, not only for the current interval but all the intervals on the horizon), and sending the data across in less than a minute. This is no small feat, and allows participants ample time for an algorithm to produce an optimisation and send their bids across. Once again, this contrasts greatly with other markets, which can be on a day-ahead or hourly granularity. A mature ecosystem These characteristics have allowed the growth of a mature ecosystem, helping participants to tap into this data, understand the market dynamics and optimise operations. AEMO itself has developed tools to manage market data efficiently, and a range of actors have developed solutions to analyse, visualise and draw insights from this data. A good testimony to this is the time it takes between a market event and a post from Paul McArdle on WattClarity (a matter of minutes). Contrast to WA, and the WEM? The value of this ecosystem became apparent when we entered the WEM : while AEMO operates that market and is also doing a great job at publishing data in real-time, the market is much smaller and participants are left to develop their own solutions to access it efficiently. These features of the market have been critical to unlock the potential of flexible assets, and in the rise of large-scale storage. Once again referencing Alex , batteries are inherently highly flexible assets, and their value is therefore realised when they are able to tap into this flexibility, co-optimising between the various services on a real-time basis. Another parallel with the WEM : a 15-minutes “gate closure” is in place, meaning that rebids made for economic reason need to be locked in 15 minutes before the interval. While 15 minutes can seem like a short-time, there is more uncertainty when a bid is locked in (e.g. what will my battery state of charge be 15 minutes from now?). This results in additional buffers taken in operations, and therefore slightly less optimal operation . Forecast data, in the NEM The forecast data published by AEMO also forms the basis of all automated bidding systems, as the purpose of such algorithm is to form a view on what will happen in the short term in order to take the best decision now. While machine learning models are being developed, I’d be surprised if models are completely ignoring AEMO’s data, which is based on a range of data sources not directly available to participants. It drastically reduces the barrier to entry to develop such automated systems. Data in the NEM : pitfalls Now that we’ve had an overview of how helpful the NEM’s relationship to data can be, this does not come without its challenges, especially for companies such as Neoen that are not inherently data or software companies. The IT challenge Operating an automated bidding system requires careful management from various data sources : the market data coming from AEMO, which spans hundreds of tables; the telemetry data from your assets; and the data produced by the automated bidding system itself. To give an order of magnitude: an automated bidding system for a bess produces bids for up to : 14 market/direction pairs, 288 intervals in the forecast horizon, for each of the 288 intervals of the day. A multitude of data points are saved for each (targets, pricebands, configuration, etc), adding up to tens of millions of data points produced per day. A robust database infrastructure is required to manage this volume in real time. Even short outages can have large impacts given the nature of the NEM, posing additional challenges : how to schedule maintenance? What strategies to prepare when, inevitably, some data points will be missing? How to design a resilient system, but still ensure issues are identified and timely addressed? As is often the case in the IT world, the teams organisation can vastly influence the way that these issues are tackled. When it comes to data management, there are two main schools of thought : 1) A centralised approach , where a dedicated data team is directly interacting with the infrastructure, taking requests from other departments and building dashboards, queries, ready to use. This prevents unexperienced users from hindering the infrastructure performance with il-designed requests, but the main risk is that the data team becomes a bottleneck, introducing friction and slowing every other team even for simple requests. 2) A decentralised approach , where teams are building their own queries and dashboards – this approach reduces friction as everyone is free to access the data as required, but requires proper training and strict documentation for every user to understand the data and the limitations of the infrastructure. Empowering real-time decision making As described earlier, decisions in the NEM are fast-pace. Real-time data access is therefore critical, but is not a sufficient condition to efficient decision-making. Here are a few pitfalls to avoid : 1) Ignoring what you don’t see. When you have 5 screens spitting numbers in front of you, it’s easy to trust what you are seeing. But this data is often not showing the full picture. One illustration : renewable assets are often not paid at the spot price. In between your PPA price, it’s negative price clause, FCAS cost recovery, LGC trading, something as trivial as “what revenue is my asset generating right now?” is not straightforward to monitor. 2) An overwhelming data feed. At the other end of the spectrum, is the tendency to watch and monitor everything : visual alerts, notifications are easy to set up. But when something goes wrong in the NEM, it’s often causing a cascading chain reaction. Too many notifications can distract you from focusing on what really matters for your portfolio. 3) Blind faith in your auto-bidder The rise of auto-bidders (which has been discussed in a range of articles tagged here ) in is posing another challenge for real-time decision making. Operating on many co-optimised markets simultaneously, it can be challenging to understand what it’s doing or why. It can therefore be tempting to trust it implicitly. But just as a human watching the market is not aware of everything, your auto-bidder is only as good as the inputs and strategies it is fed with – and it can therefore ignore important factors at times. This will join one of the conclusions of James’ presentation : a careful balance between efficient automation and informed human oversight is key. The analysis paralysis This last point relates more to long-term analysis than real-time operations. With the wealth of data available at a 5 minute granularity in the NEM, the common trap is to dive deep in the data, end up at some point lost in the data and losing sight of the bigger picture. To avoid this, analysts have long been working on aggregated data, and building simplified KPIs to extract long-term trends and insights. However, this can sometimes hide a crucial part of the phenomenon we are trying to describe. For instance, when analysing battery performances, the intraday spread is often used as a proxy for the revenue potential of the battery on a particular day (just like the average price will be used for a generation asset). For more detail on the definition of the intraday spread, refer to the presentation by Alex. I have cherry-picked two days in VIC with similar intraday spreads : the 16th of September, with a 2h intraday spread of $169/MWh, and the 9th of June, with an intraday spread of $180/MWh. Judging by these numbers, a battery should get similar revenues on both days. But if we look at the 5min data, two very different realities emerge : 1) The 16th of September had a usual profile, with negative prices in the afternoon allowing to charge the battery, and a consistent evening peak where a battery would be allowed to discharge above $100/MWh. 2) The 9th of June , on the other end, sees prices jumping up and down in the middle of the day, with swings of more than $200/MWh between intervals, without a clear pattern. If your auto-bidder can capture as much value as on the 9th of June, I’d be pretty impressed! While simplified analysis is inevitable in the NEM, this example only shows the importance of staying conscious of the limitations they carry, and to keep a critical eye on the results.

    "date": "10-11-2024 04:17:00 PM",

Last Thursday evening we noted that ‘VIC1-NSW1 interconnector unable to Target Flow north, on Thursday afternoon-evening 7th November 2024’ . … following from that article, a number of readers expressed their gratitude for helping to clarify the significance of the interconnector limitation. In part because of that, we thought it was probably best to start with this slightly longer (3-day long) view of the VIC1-NSW1 Target Flow, Import and Export Limits, and also the Price Difference between NSW and VIC regions: Across this three day span: 1) We already noted some brief ‘Early evening volatility in QLD and NSW on Wednesday 6th November 2024’ . … in the chart above, we can see that the few dispatch intervals with a large positive price difference occurred when the interconnector was flowing north at ~+600MW . 2) Thursday 7th November 2024 was a much more significant period of volatility: (a) With a number of articles already written to discuss various aspects of what occurred, all catalogued here : … with perhaps more to come (time permitting) (b) From the chart above we can see that the VIC1-NSW1 clamped tightly so it’s unable to flow much in either direction . 3) We also noted that there was ‘A much shorter run of evening volatility in QLD and NSW on Friday 8th November 2024’ … in the chart we see that the volatile period on this day has flows running very strongly south . So each of the three days saw periods of volatility in NSW compared to VIC … and on each of the three occasions the VIC1-NSW1 interconnector delivered quite different flow patterns . Constraint Equations, and Constraint Sets, played a significant role in this outcome … and below we’ll start to provide an explanation for this (though will require more than just this article to do it properly). The role of constraints With respect to Thursday afternoon/evening we already published ‘Three dispatch intervals (sampled from a long run of volatility on Thursday 7th November 2024) to illustrate the complexity (and significance) of congestion’ . That article has generated some interest – including with Dave Smith’s note here on LinkedIn : So hopefully this follow-on article (and others to come) will also help… Some high-level reminders about Explicit Constraints At any given time the AEMO (via NEMDE) invokes something like ~600 constraint equations to ~1200 constraint equations in order to reflect the state of the network for the dispatch interval in focus. 1) The higher number of constraint equations invoked* occurs during ‘outage season’, when transmission operators take network outages (and generators also have their units on outage at times. * note that ‘invoked’ is just the fancy NEM time for ‘used’ 2) Constraint Equations are always invoked in Constraint Sets 3) The basic form of a constraint equation is as follows: Why are Readers (here) interested in Constraints? We know that there’s a diverse bunch of readers of this site – and I’m guessing that different readers might fall into one (or more) of the following categories: Category 1 might be primarily focused on broader market outcomes … principally interested in why the NSW (and QLD) price was so high for so long? … perhaps this group might be largest in number, but we don’t really know? Category 2 will include those who have particular interest in specific assets (such as those that were constrained down across the various regions through these periods) and read articles here to gain some insight in what might have happened to them … we’ve heard of many instances where articles such as these are handed around internally to help the broader team understand Category 3 includes those who are interested in these articles to find some tips and tricks to deploy in their own usage of our software. Category 4 includes those who are more focused on the future – which might be in relation to: (a) Business development; and/or (b) Regulatory reforms; (c) Or something else Other Categories … and, no doubt, there are those readers who don’t fall neatly into any of the above. So in writing this article, we’ve tried to include some observations for a cross-section of readers. The ‘N-MNYS_5_WG_CLOSE ’ constraint set invoked from early Thursday morning With respect to the challenges with volatility (and constrained megawatts etc) on 7th November , one of the places to start the story might be at 05:10 on Thursday morning 7th November 2024 when a copy of the ‘Notifications’ widget within ez2view triggered this email alert for us, giving us some warning of one of the contributing factors: Some key points here: 1) Allan’s article ‘What’s happening around Wagga’ provides a good explanation of the challenges relating to the multiple 330kV ‘highways’ connecting Victoria into central NSW . 2) In part because of those issues, ages ago we pre-configured an alert within the ‘Notifications’ widget in ez2view to alert us to any constraint sets becoming invoked that relate to outages on any of these 330kV lines. (a) Sometimes these network outages pass with minimal fuss (b) But occasionally (such as on 7th November 2024 ) they pack a punch. In this case, it’s the ‘N-MNYS_5_WG_CLOSE ’ constraint set that is ‘the culprit’ … but there are other cases documented here where similar issues have arisen because one of the other highways are out of action. Let’s use the ‘Constraint Set’ Details widget for the the ‘N-MNYS_5_WG_CLOSE ’ constraint set to have a quick look at what it’s about, time-travelled back to the 05:10 dispatch interval ( NEM time ) on Thursday morning: There’s a few key points here: 1) We see that the ‘N-MNYS_5_WG_CLOSE’ constraint set became invoked in the 05:05 dispatch interval this morning … hence the email alert 2) Importantly, note that the ‘N-MNYS_5_WG_CLOSE’ constraint set is envisaged to remain invoked out until 16:00 on Tuesday 26th November 2024 (a) That’s over 2 weeks away (b) a harbinger of more volatility to come, if other conditions are right? 3) The Constraint Set is in place because: (a) of a network outage… ‘ Marulan – Yass (5) 330kV line ’ (b) with … ‘Wagga-Yass 132kV parallel lines CLOSED’ 4) It contains many different Constraint Equations as members of the Set (a) any of those might bind in a dispatch interval – each equation having a different effect (b) with three different Constraint Equations in this set featuring in these ‘Three dispatch intervals (sampled from a long run of volatility on Thursday 7th November 2024) to illustrate the complexity (and significance) of congestion’ .: i. There was the ‘N::N_MNYS_2’ constraint equation bound (at 14:25, 15:50, and 17:55). ii. There was the ‘N>>5_998_4’ constraint equation bound (at 15:50 and 17:55). iii. There was the ‘N>>5_998_61’ constraint equation bound (at 17:55). (c) Remember that we’ve not looked at all the other dispatch intervals Borrowing the same TransGrid diagram that Allan used in his article , here’s the relevant ‘Line 5, between Marulan and Yass’ highlighted : Note that Allan’s article was mostly written with respect to the Line 051 (also highlighted above) – for which the concerns are somewhat different . However there are also some broad similarities , in that flow capacity into central NSW from southern NSW is limited – as a result of which the situation is quite different (within NSW) either side of that link: 1) South of Line 5 there’s reduced capacity to get power ‘to market’ … but, because everyone in NSW is paid the RRP, there’s increased desire to be dispatched (a) which leads to some interesting bidding behaviour – some specifics of which we might look at in a subsequent article, time permitting; (b) as a result of which the affected unit’s CPD Price drops to –$1,000/MWh (or worse), as they jostle for limited headroom; whist 2) North of Line 5 there’s an increased opportunity to dispatch (because what’s happening further south), and also increased incentive to dispatch (because of the high RRP for the NSW Region). So we’ll leave this article here for now, as something we’ll be able to refer back to later as we continue to unpick some of what happened on Thursday 7th November 2024 … and also with reference to other events as well.",

As a stepping stone to further analysis, we extracted data from around that time and present the two charts, starting with the entire extracted range: Utilising the extracted data to ascertain the specific time points and precise frequency readings, we’ve presented the following hour worth of readings (from 13:30 to 14:30 NEM time ) to cover both of the events noted in yesterday afternoon’s article: Event 1 = there was a the fairly steep afternoon ramp in ‘ Market Demand ’ across the NEM from 13:35 (18,399MW) to 13:50 (19,570MW) … i.e. 1,171MW over 15 minutes. Event 2 = there was the price spike in NSW (to $14,322.98/MWh) as dispatch target for the 14:25 dispatch interval. Event 3 = We can see in the following chart that the sharpest ramp up in System Frequenc y occurred in between those two Events … wholly within the 14:20 dispatch interval.

    "date": "08-11-2024 10:55:00 AM",
    "content": "With apologies in advance for this article, which will probably prompt more questions than it answers, we’ve selected three dispatch intervals through the long run of volatility in the QLD and NSW regions on Thursday 7th November 2024 to help illustrate: 1) How the issue of ‘congestion’ or ‘constraints’ in the NEM is so complex; 2) But also why it’s so significant to price and dispatch outcomes . The intent is that we might start from here and then drill in further to these (and other) particular dispatch intervals ( and Constraint Equations and Constraint Sets ) … but those subsequent articles might take a while to complete. In the meantime those less knowledgeable readers might just take this as another illustration of how ‘The NEM’s a complex place™ … and increasingly so!’ . General notes: 1) All times are ‘ NEM time ’ 2) All dispatch intervals illustrated with a collage of widgets from our ez2view software: (a) The ‘Swim Lanes’ widget (b) The ‘NEM Prices’ widget (c) The ‘Bound Constraints’ widget (d) Plus a prototype new widget we’ve been workshopping with clients in recent times: i. which helps to tell the story… ii. briefly, the dots are DUIDs coloured by each units CPD Price (which, you will clearly see, varies between DUIDs over an enormous range … due to congestion). iii. Default colouring utilises the same default ‘Blue Green and Red’ colour scheme we’ve used for quite a while to categorise bids … such as in the article ‘Updated trend of ‘ENERGY’ bids in red, green and blue’ from April 2024. The 14:25 dispatch interval We’ve selected this one, in part, because it was the one written up with ‘Price volatility starts early, on Thursday 7th November 2024’ early yesterday afternoon: There’s plenty that could be pointed out in this single dispatch interval – some annotated on the image – but we’ll start with these highlights: 1) In Queensland we have one form of a ‘central-to-south’ style constraint equation bound : (a) This is the ‘Q>>NIL_BCCP_RGLC’ constraint equation : i. Which is a member of the ‘System Normal’ constraint set ii. And is intended to ‘avoid overload of Raglan to Larcom Creek (8875) on trip of Bouldercombe to Calliope River (812) line’ . (b) Which acts to dissuade generation in the north and promote supply options in the south … depending on how each unit bids, of course! (c) More about this one later… 2) In NSW we have three separate constraint equations, each of which has a different purpose and effect, all combining to deliver a colourful map (and complex dispatch outcome): (a) We have the ‘N>>NIL_964_84_S’ constraint equation i. Which is a member of the ‘System Normal’ constraint set ; and ii. Which is intended to ‘avoid overload of Port Macquarie to Herron Creek Tee (964/2) on trip of Tamworth to Liddell (84) line,’ ii. Affects units in northern NSW (b) We have the ‘N::N_MNYS_2’ constraint equation i. Which is a member of the ‘N-MNYS_5_WG_CLOSE’ constraint set ii. Which is an outage-related constraint set in place because there is an ‘outage of the Marulan – Yass (5) 330kV line [with Wagga-Yass 132kV parallel lines CLOSED]’ iii. With the constraint equation bound above impacting on many units across southern NSW either side of the 330kV outage . iv. Note that the ‘N::N_MNYS_2’ constraint equation is the only constraint equation (in this set) bound … at this point… v. More about this one later… (c) We also have the ‘N^N-LS_SVC’ constraint equation i. Which impacts on the Directlink interconnector ii. During times of ‘outage of Lismore SVC, or reactive power control mode’ . 3) There are obviously other constraints that were bound in this dispatch interval … but the above were the main ones. The 15:50 dispatch interval The second dispatch interval we’re going to (semi-randomly) select is the 15:50 dispatch interval … because it was ( as highlighted here ) the next dispatch interval that saw prices above $1,000/MWh in QLD and NSW: In this case, there are three bundles of constraint equations that we’d like to highlight: 1) In a Queensland ‘System Normal’ constraint set , we a different form of a ‘central-to-south’ style constraint equation bound : (a) This one is the ‘Q^^NIL_CS’ constraint equation (b) Which implements a ‘CQ-SQ voltage stability limit’ … ‘to prevent voltage collapse for a trip of a single Calvale-Halys line’ 2) Of all the constraint equations in the ‘N-MNYS_5_WG_CLOSE’ constraint set (the outage-related constraint set noted above), in this dispatch interval there are two constraint equations bound : (a) We have the ‘N::N_MNYS_2’ constraint equation bound … as it was at 14:25 above (b) But we also have the ‘N>>5_998_4’ constraint equation bound: i. This one is to ‘avoid overload on Cowra to Forbes (998) 132kV line on trip of Collector to Marulan (4) 330kV line, [Wagga-Yass 132kV parallel lines CLOSED]’ ii. There are also a large number of DUIDs on the LHS of this constraint equation. 3) Thirdly there are some constraint equations bound in the ‘I-BDBU_ONE’ constraint set: (a) This constraint set is for ‘outage of Bundey to Buronga (6F) 330kV line, #5 Buronga phase-shifting transformer or #8 220/330kV transformer’ (b) And the two constraint equations bound are: i. The ‘V^^V_BDBU_KGTS’ constraint equation is bound; and ii. The ‘V>>BDBU_ELML_BAML2’ constraint equation is bound. The 17:55 dispatch interval The third interval we’re going to (semi-randomly) select is the 17:55 dispatch interval … because it was the one selected for the NEMwatch snapshot when reporting the ‘Late afternoon and Evening run of volatility in NSW and QLD, on Thursday 7th November 2024’ : In this dispatch interval we see some commonality, but also some differences… 1) In Queensland the two different types of broader divided (shown above) have unbound and instead there’s a hyper-localised ‘Q>NIL_TV66’ constraint equation that’s impacting a couple units in Townsville. 2) In NSW we see the ‘N-MNYS_5_WG_CLOSE’ constraint set once again … but on this occasion three constraint equations are bound : (a) We again have the ‘N::N_MNYS_2’ constraint equation bound … as it was at 14:25 and 15:50 above (b) We have the ‘N>>5_998_61’ constraint equation for the first time in this article: i. Which is to ‘avoid overload of Cowra to Forbes (998) 132kV line on trip of Crookwell to Bannaby (61) 330kV line, [Wagga-Yass 132kV parallel lines CLOSED]’ ii. And has many DUIDs on the LHS (c) We also have the ‘N>>5_998_4’ constraint equation bound … as it was at 15:50 above. 3) In NSW we also se the ‘N>NIL_999’ constraint equation bound (a) This is a System Normal constraint equation (b) Which is to ‘avoid overload of Bango999 to Cowra (999)’ . 4) Also notable in South Australia there are two constraint equations bound in their own System Normal constraint set: (a) We have the ‘S>NIL_HUWT_STBG3’ constraint equation bound (b) We also have the ‘S-NIL_WTPT_SC+INV_2’ constraint equation bound … but we’ll leave them along for now… One of the main take-aways that readers might make in the above is that it was not just one constraint equation that was the single cause of all that went on in the price volatility on Thursday 7th November 2024 !",

For the broader readership, a couple key points: 1) Better to think of an interconnector as a collection of all of the network elements making up the flow path between the relevant Regional Reference Nodes than just the bits of kit hanging over both sides of the region boundary – as per this sketch: 2) NEMDE is a mathematical model that produces dispatch (including price) outcomes … (a) interconnectors need a number sign (i.e. flow in one direction is positive, the other direction is negative) (b) easiest way I find to remember is that it’s Hobart-centric (c) so for the VIC1-NSW1 interconnector, we have: i. Flow (and Limits) VIC to NSW are positive ii. Flow (and Limits) NSW to VIC are negative 3) We can see in the chart above: (a) that the Export Limit and Export Limit vary markedly through all dispatch intervals in a day: i. That’s because of the effect of constraints ii. We recently also showed a different case for the ‘Heywood’ interconnector on 23rd September 2024 . (b) that flow will normally be from cheap region to expensive region … but that’s not always the case. 4) In the case of the VIC1-NSW1 interconnector, we see that from before 12:00 ( NEM time ) today, any flow north was not possible. … in a subsequent article we’ll help explain why…",

So I thought it was worth a quick look in the morning of Thursday 7th November 2024 utilizing this collage of 4 different ‘Forecast Convergence’ widgets in ez2view at the 08:35 dispatch interval looking forward to this evening: Keep in mind that this with allows one to ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to ‘see that other dimension of time ’ … and that you can click on the image to open a larger view. We see that: 1) The forecasts for LOR2 conditions in NSW and QLD have both moderated: (a) No forecast LORx condition of any colour in NSW currently; and (b) Down to forecast LOR1 in QLD … but there it’s visible that there was a very brief period where the red swatch shows forecast LOR3 in the NSW region a few days ago, looking forward to this evening! 2) In terms of prices: (a) We can see the evening volatility up until 18:00 yesterday (b) We can see a wide swatch of spicy prices for both regions for this evening … with QLD colours showing ‘higher for longer’ than in NSW. Stay tuned…",

    "title": "The effect of the ‘S_PPT+SNPT+BLVR_220’ Constraint Equation on Monday 23rd September 2024 (Part 4 of a Case Study)",
    "date": "05-11-2024 04:07:00 PM",
    "content": "We’ve already posted three earlier parts in this case Study : 1) On the day, we published ‘Evening blast of spot price volatility in South Australia on Monday 23rd September 2024’ as (what we’re now calling) Part 1. 2) Earlier this week, we published ‘ Taking a look inside South Australia’s lengthy run of volatility on Monday 23rd September 2024 ’, as Part 2: (a) In that article we highlighted that there was a period of volatility: i. This began at 17:50 ( NEM time ) with the price at $3,499.99/MWh – up from $286.89/MWh at 17:45 ii. and ended at 20:30 ( NEM time ) with the price at $8,800.01/MWh – before dropping to $560.04/MWh at 20:35 (b) we also highlighted that the ‘Heywood’ interconnector was running hard west for the duration of this period of volatility: i. often during the time range above ii. which created an ‘ Economic Island ’ and allowed SA prices to separate from (lower) VIC prices (c) We also used the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget to highlight the supply stack 3) Then we posted ‘Reviewing 12 dispatch intervals in South Australia on Monday 23rd September 2024’ as Part 3: (a) Which spanned the 17:45 to 18:40 dispatch intervals, and so highlighted some of the underlying factors (b) Including a very thin supply stack of any volume bid in between $0/MWh and the Market Price Cap i. and especially in the ‘green’ price ranges (from $0/MWh to $300/MWh), ii. which traditionally would have hosted many thermal units bidding their short run marginal costs iii. and hence delivering a ‘stickiness’ of prices in that range. iv. whereas in contrast now prices more often sail right through from negative prices to sky-high prices and not much in between (as one outcome of this energy transition ). (c) In this article we also saw two constraint equations bound: i. We saw the ‘V^SML_BUDP_3’ Constraint Equation that’s bound, affecting the flow on the Murraylink interconnector … we might look at this more in another subsequent article ii. We also saw the ‘S_PPT+SNPT+BLVR_220’ Constraint Equation , affecting the three units (BOLIVPS1, PPCCGT and SNAPPER1) . In this article, we’ll take a closer look at the ‘S_PPT+SNPT+BLVR_220’ Constraint Equation , to see how this impacted on Market Outcomes… (A) Some background to Constraint Equations Remember that NEMDE (the NEM Dispatch Engine) is an LP*-based dispatch optimisation engine. * note that LP stands for Linear Program 1) This utilises a series of (implicit and) explicit constraint equations to translate the complexities of the physical grid, and aspects of the market rules, into mathematical terms 2) The Implicit Constraints are things like: (a) DUID Target can’t be more than Maximum Capacity (b) Increase in Target for unit (i.e. Target – InitialMW) can’t be more than the ramp rate up over 5 minutes. etc… 3) The Explicit Constraints are the things represented in Constraint Equations you can see in the EMMS, and which software like ez2view makes more understandable through widgets like the ‘Constraint Dashboard’ widget . (B) About the the ‘S_PPT+SNPT+BLVR_220’ Constraint Equation So let’s use the ‘S_PPT+SNPT+BLVR_220’ Constraint Equation to illustrate some of these concepts…. B1) Details of the Constraint Equation Briefly, let’s understand that the form of this particular constraint is as follows… B1a) The form of the Constraint Equation Looking at the formula itself (in the ‘Constraint Dashboard’ widget , but not shown here in all the images) … LHS ≤ RHS … where: i. the Left-Hand Side (LHS) contains all the terms that NEMDE tries to influence in the co-optimisation process assembled in a linear equation … in this case LHS = 1.0 x Target (BOLIVPS1) + 1.0 x Target (PPCCGT) + 1.0 x Target (SNAPPER1) ii. the Right-Hand Side (RHS) reflects the things that generally NEMDE can’t control, but essentially treats as an constant for the given dispatch interval. … in this case: Default RHS value= 220 … believe me, they are often much more complex than that! B1b) Other Details Extra details of the Constraint Equation are: Description: ‘SA Pelican Point + Snapper Point generation +Bolivar PS<= 220 MW’ Reason: ‘Upper limit on Pelican Pt + Snapper generation+ Bolivar PS’ … neither tell us much more than the LHS does, in this instance. B1c) Invocation (the fancy term for ‘in use’) Remember that Constraint Equations are ‘invoked’ in Constraint Sets (because the network is often more complex than linear in form). In this case the ‘Constraint Dashboard’ widget shows the following additional details i. It’s invoked in the ‘S-PAPG’ constraint set ii. Which relates to a network outage of ‘Para to Parafield Gardens West 275kV’ in South Australia iii. Which … 1. at that time, was scheduled to be invoked through until 17:00 on 1st October 2024 (and then again for a couple durations in October). 2. and had been invoked since 18th September 2024 (in that outage), and in the past as well. B2) Specific Dispatch Intervals In our Part 3 of the Case Study , we started at the 17:45 dispatch interval, as that was just before the start of the run of evening volatility. However in this article we need to look back earlier in time, because of a few earlier developments. Because of this, we’ll be skipping over a number of dispatch intervals in intervening periods… The 15:00 Dispatch interval At the 15:00 dispatch interval ( NEM time ) we can sum up the story as ‘all’s quiet’ . With all of the images below (there are quite a few!) remember to click on the image to open in larger resolution (readable!) form in another tab. Specifically: 1) All three units have a 0MW Target 2) This is because: (a) Two units (PPCGT and BOLIVPS1) have no volume offered at all; whilst (b) SNAPPER1 has 150MW offered to NEMDE, but at and above +$1,000/MWh at the RRN … which is ‘out of the money’ – hence a 0MW Target 3) As a result of the 3 lots of 0MW Target, the LHS calculates to 0MW and the constraint equation is not bound. So let’s step forward …. The 15:30 Dispatch interval At this point we see nothing has changed, from a ‘current dispatch interval’ perspective: But we do see that the restart of the three units is expected to happen sequentially – one, then two, then three in the two charts in predispatch as highlighted. It is forecast at this point that the constraint will bind, within the next hour . The 15:35 Dispatch interval Stepping forward 5 minutes and we see PPCCGT starts up: We see: 1) The generator adds 6MW to its bid band at –$1,000/MWh, which NEMDE accepts gratefully and allocates a Dispatch Target to. 2) On the LHS of the constraint: (a) this means (rinsing through the factor of +1.0) the contribution is 6MW and hence the LHS is 6MW (b) with LHS << RHS the constraint is a long way from binding. So let’s skip a few dispatch intervals … The 16:00 Dispatch interval At 16:00, the PPCCGT unit is up to 70MW Availability (and Target): The other two units have not noticeably moved… The 16:30 Dispatch interval Six dispatch intervals later, the PPCGT unit has 160MW offered down at –$1,000/MWh … but we see only 131MW Target (i.e. NEMDE seems to be leaving 29MW of ‘cheap’ energy on the shelf ), and we wonder why that’s the case ? So we flip to the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in the ez2view software to see more detail about the PPCCGT unit: As noted in the annotation, we see the unit received a ramp up signal of 60MW (or 12 MW/minute) from 71MW (InitialMW) to 131MW (Target). That ROCUP rate was as bid by the unit as is one of those ‘Implicit Constraints’ noted above – and, importantly, ramp rate constraints will never be violated by NEMDE (i.e. they have a very high implied ‘Weight’). So that explains why some of that ‘cheap’ energy offered in this dispatch interval can’t be allocated a target… The 16:35 Dispatch interval Stepping forward we might expect to see a further ramp up in output (utilising that 12MW/min ROCUP rate) would absorb all of that ‘cheap’ energy from PPCCGT in the Target 5 minutes later … but that’s not the case! Instead, we see that the Target is now capped at 220MW … 1) … because the LHS of the constraint equals the RHS of the constraint 2) … which means that the constraint is bound 3) … and, as a result, has a non-zero Marginal Value. 4) We see that, as a result, the bound constraint drives the CPD Price for all three units down to –$1,000/MWh The constraint is full … and that’s even before the other two units (BOLIVPS1 and SNAPPER1) begin to ramp up! The 17:00 Dispatch interval So we step forward 25 minutes to the 17:00 dispatch interval: The situation is largely the same. Starting from this point, we’ll walk through each dispatch interval in turn… The 17:05 Dispatch interval Stepping forward 5 minutes, we see that there was a change in bid (on this occasion a rebid) for SNAPPER1 …. However (because the cheapest volume offered was still at +$1,000/MWh at the RRN, there’s no change to dispatch outcomes. The 17:10 Dispatch interval Five minutes later another rebid at SNAPPER1: Volume offered is reduced (from 150MW to 85MW), and that 85MW is also offered at a ‘cheaper’ price band (i.e. $230/MWh at the RRN). But it’s still not cheap enough to be dispatched, noting that the CPD Price for the unit is down at –$1,000/MWh due to the bound constraint. The 17:15 Dispatch interval Another 5 minutes later and the picture remains the same: The 17:20 Dispatch interval Another 5 minutes on, and there’s no substantial change: Note that we know ( in hindsight , which is a wonderful thing! ) that there was volatility that began within the hour. There is an expectation of volatility shown in the P30 predispatch forecast … but remember that there are many instances where: 1) Forecasts have been a ‘false positive’ … leading many to believe that the AEMO’s forecasts were somehow ‘wrong’ 2) A more correct/informed view: (a) is that the AEMO P30 price forecasts are one of the forecasts published by AEMO intended to elicit a response (b) so the fact that some market response meant the price forecast often does not eventuate is a ‘Very Good Thing™’ (c) as was loudly noted in ‘Operating in the NEM’ session during All Energy 2024 … yes, it was me who clapped loudly at one of the speaker’s answer to that question from the floor! So keep in mind that the RRP at the time (‘only’ $138.25/MWh) would likely not be enough to pay back the SRMC of the two other peaking units that are not running at this point… The 17:25 Dispatch interval Five minutes on and the puzzle starts to get more interesting… We see that: 1) SNAPPER1 increases (back to 150MW) the volume that it’s offered to NEMDE; 2) This remains offered at $230/MWh at the RRN 3) We note that the RRP is now above this level (at $297.73/MWh) (a) Which would ordinarily* see the unit receive a Target * note … ‘ordinarily’, with quite a few caveats! (b) But you’ll see that this is not the case here. 4) Which is a reminder that the ‘price to beat’ for these units is the (constraint depressed) CPD Price , which sits down at –$1,000/MWh at the RRN. … so SNAPPER1 could be seen as being ‘constrained down’ in this dispatch interval. The 17:30 Dispatch interval At 17:30 we start to get to much more complex dispatch intervals: As we can see in this snapshot: 1) SNAPPER1 moves its 150MW of Availability from $230 (at the RRN) to –$1,000 (at the RRN) 2) Because this is ‘at or below’ the (constraint depressed) CPD Price for the unit: (a) it should get a target (b) but this is where the complexity starts i. because PPCCGT is already producing the 220MW that forms the aggregate limit of output across the three units ii. so that means giving a Target to SNAPPER1 means that PPCCGT gets less 3) Now Marcelle already thankfully explained ‘ Who gets to run when everyone bids the same ? A crash course in disorderly bidding and tie-breaking’ back in 2022 … including the excerpt from Clause 3.8.16 of the NER has the tie-breaking principle: “Equal priced dispatch bids and dispatch offers … the MW quantities specified in the relevant price bands of those dispatch bids or dispatch offers must be dispatched on a pro-rata basis, where this can be achieved without imposing undue costs on any party, or violating other constraints.” 4) So my simplistic read of this suggests that the logic would work as follows… (a) Total Volume offered at –$1,000 = 241MW + 150MW = 391MW (b) Total RHS allowance translating back to Targets (remembering this is easy as Factors are all +1.0) = 220/391 = 56% (c) So that should mean that: i. PPCCGT gets 56% of 241MW = 136MW ii. SNAPPER1 gets 56% of 150MW = 84MW (d) But wait, that’s not what we see … instead we see: i. PPCCGT gets 156MW … which is higher than 136MW ii. SNAPPER1 gets 64MW … which is lower than 84MW 5) In this case we can see, using the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in the ez2view software for the PPCCGT unit that ramp rates rear their head again … this time ROCDOWN : (a) The ROCDOWN rate for PPCCGT in this dispatch interval is -12MW/min (b) So that means a Target of 156MW … which is: i. 60MW down from the 216MW InitialMW ii. Or -12MW/min. (c) That also then means that the available space for SNAPPER1 is only 64MW … i.e. the 220MW (RHS limit) – 156MW (contribution from PPCGT taking into account the LHS Factor of +1.0). Complex, right!? The 17:35 Dispatch interval Hold onto your hats, because 17:35 becomes even more complex… Without going into as much detail as above, we see that: 1) BOLIVPS1 enters the market, with 96MW added to the –$1,000/MWh bid band. (a) the headline here is that there’s now 489MW of Available Capacity across 3 units, all squabbling for 220MW of available RHS on the constraint . (b) In this dispatch interval the RRP is $149.99/MWh … but we know (ah, that hindsight thing) that the price goes ballistic shortly, so the opportunity cost on missing out on volume (hence spot revenue) is going to be enormous! (c) something about Camel and ‘eye of the needle’ comes to mind?! 2) Simplistically applying Marcelle’s tie-breaker explanation what we would expect to happen would be: (a) The new entrant (BOLIVPS1) to go up; and (b) The two existing producers (PPCCGT and SNAPPER1) to each go down. … but look at the data above and see that: i. this is not the case. ii. specifically, PPCGT remains steady with a Target of 163MW … whilst SNAPPER1 goes down by the same amount (-22MW) that BOLIVPS1 goes up (+22MW). Wait, what? So let’s again use the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in the ez2view software for the PPCCGT unit that ramp rates rear their head again … again this time ROCDOWN : As noted on the image: 1) The PPCCGT unit has submitted a rebid: (a) Which lowers their ROCDOWN rate (which you remember was –12MW/min) to be 0MW/min (b) this was in a rebid received at the AEMO at 17:26 so taking first effect in the ~17:30 NEMDE run for the 17:35 dispatch interval 2) The effect of this rebid is: (a) for PPCGT it effectively puts a floor on the PPCGT target … i.e. Target (163MW) = InitialMW (163MW) (b) for the other two units, that means the combined target is shared for the remainder of the RHS: i. RHS (220MW) – PPCGT (163MW) = 57MW ii. So 22 (of 96MW for BOLIVPS1) and 35 (of 150MW for SNAPPER1). 3) The rebid reason given for this rebid was ‘Target below Unit Technical Minimum’ …. (a) Without slipping down that rabbit hole, I am hearing echoes of an AEMC forum back in 2014 or 2015 at a Forum held during the ‘ Bidding in Good Faith’ deliberations – during which: i. Some were vocal that rebids should not be able to change ramp rates; ii. Whilst there was strong push-back from some generators who clearly made the point that there might be occasions when it was necessary to do so … perhaps like this occasion? (b) Keen eyed readers will also see in the trended bid stack chart above for the PPCGT unit ( highlighted in orange ) that the level of unit output pertaining to the reset of ROCDOWN = 0MW is actually above the level of output seen the last time the unit ran . This will obviously prompt questions – I don’t know what the answer is, but wonder: i. Is the difference something to do with different configurations within the CCGT assembly of GTs and ST? ii. Or was the rebid placed with respect to what the P5 predispatch target was going to be for the 17:35 dispatch interval (i.e. before the rebid)? iii. Or was it something else? Perhaps some more learned reader can help us out (e.g. in comments below)? Suffice to say, this ‘simple’ example illustrates that the NEM is a complex place ! The 17:40 Dispatch interval Moving right along, we see that the wash-up for the 17:40 dispatch interval is similar to 17:35, with the same issues occurring: The 17:45 Dispatch interval The picture looks quite similar for 17:45: The 17:50 Dispatch interval At this dispatch interval (as we saw in Part 3 of this Case Study) the price spikes to $3,499.99/MWh – up from $286.89/MWh at 17:45. (C) Summing up So, bringing it back almost full circle, in Part 2 we wondered why there was considerable volume of gas-fired generation that was bid down at –$1,000/MWh but yet which was not dispatched. This was shown in this trended Bid Stack from ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view : I wonder if the ‘S_PPT+SNPT+BLVR_220’ Constraint Equation is the only reason why there’s Gas-Fired Generation bid down at –$1,000/MWh at the RRN that’s not dispatched? One way of checking this is via the modified filter below, in which we look at using this ‘Power Filter’ for the bids as follows: This gives us the following picture of ‘net’ volumes of bids from gas-fired generation: So that’s where we’ll leave this Part 4 in the Case Study …",

It shows 74 market notices containing the phrase ‘LOR’. All market notices that contain the phrase ‘LOR’ in the past 7 days. Source: ez2view’s AEMO Market Notices Widget In the next few charts, we’ll see the trend in forecast changes for several different measures, as they relate to Thursday morning and afternoon in NSW and QLD. We’ll start with an updated look at how the LOR conditions have been changing within the three LOR tiers , for the two regions. In these screenshots, yellow represents a forecast LOR1, orange represents a forecast LOR2, and red represents a forecast LOR3. The forecast convergence of LOR notices for NSW (top) and QLD (bottom). Source: ez2view’s Forecast Convergence widget Next we’ll look at the forecast convergence of surplus generation* in each of these regions, as published in STPASA. The asterisk is because the numbers show the projected deficit in available generation vs demand in both regions. The current STPASA run, as of midday today, is projecting ‘surplus generation’ to hit a low of -1,564 MW in NSW for 16:30 on Thursday (NEM time) and to hit a low of -294 MW in QLD for 18:30 on Thursday (NEM time). The forecast convergence of surplus generation for NSW (top) and QLD (bottom). Note that both charts are autoscaled, hence colour scales are different on each chart. Source: ez2view’s Forecast Convergence widget We should keep in mind that the LOR forecast mechanism is meant to act as a signal – that a market response is being sought to alleviate projected supply-demand tightness, where and as possible. As is evident in the charts above, the market has yet to respond – but we will be keeping an eye on how these forecasts continue to converge on the actual outcome, as time approaches.",

    "content": "This update from Frank Calabria (CEO of Origin) popped up in my feed yesterday with respect to Frank’s talk at the CEDA Lunch in Sydney on Monday 4th November 2024 : … and I’ve seen a few media articles covering some of the talk – so I thought I’d have a quick read. Having read the talk, I thought it would be worth sharing here on WattClarity – in part because we might refer back to it later: (A) The full text of Frank’s Speech Frank’s full speech was published on the Origin website under ‘Actions to return stability and security to Australia’s energy markets and support the transition to net zero’ , and have been copied below for our ease of future reference: To begin, I would like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which we are meeting today, the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, and pay my respects to their Elders past and present. It has been two years since I last addressed a CEDA luncheon in Sydney and it is an absolute pleasure to be with you again. Today, I am eager to share some perspectives on Australia’s energy transition. Progress is being made and there is an incredible amount of work underway across the public and private sectors to deliver new renewables, storage, firming and transmission infrastructure. Without minimising the challenges we face in executing this first phase of the transition to meet Australia’s 2030 emissions goals, today I am hoping to lift our gaze towards the longer-term horizon. I would like to talk about Australia’s ambitions to be net zero by 2050 and the transformation this will require of our energy system. There is strong alignment towards this goal across all sides of politics, the energy industry and the business community. It is also my belief that this long-term ambition enjoys broad-based support from the Australian community. To achieve this goal while continuing to deliver reliable, secure and affordable energy supply, will require us to look carefully at the design of the National Electricity Market (NEM) and opportunities to ensure it remains fit for purpose. A more variable and complex energy system First, I want to illustrate the reasons why reform of the NEM — which is both the physical power system and wholesale electricity market covering the eastern and south-eastern states of Australia — is important, and to highlight the challenges and opportunities facing today’s market. The NEM in 2024 is infinitely more complex than it was for the first two and half decades of its existence. When the NEM commenced in 1998, Australia’s population was around 18.5 million and our economic output was approximately half a trillion dollars. The NEM was made up of a small number of large generation assets and these assets and transmission lines were largely government-owned. The market was oversupplied with coal-fired generation, there was very limited interconnection between the energy market in each state and limited retail competition. Fast forward to today, and our population is 27 million and the economy is almost four times larger than it was when the NEM was established. Today, the supply-demand balance in the NEM is tight as ageing coal plant retires. Demand has been steady for the last 15 years, largely due to the impact of rooftop solar which has been added to millions of houses. State energy markets are connected through significant transmission with more being built. Retail competition is strong and of course large-scale renewables have also grown materially. If we look out to 2040, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) projects that electricity demand will have risen by 56 per cent and all coal plants will have retired. The scale and mix of generation in the NEM is on a trajectory of tremendous change: In 1998, total generation capacity was 35 GW. Coal comprised 25 GW, or more than two-thirds of the energy mix, with the remainder made up of gas and hydro. There was virtually no rooftop solar or variable renewable energy. Today, the NEM’s generation capacity is 85 GW. Coal comprises one quarter of the mix, large scale wind and solar make up a quarter, another quarter is rooftop solar, while gas and hydro make up the final quarter. By 2040, the NEM is projected to grow to 224 GW, according to AEMO’s Integrated Systems Plan Step Change scenario, and all coal will have retired. That’s more than six times the capacity for which the NEM was originally designed and some two-and-a-half times its capacity today. Large-scale wind and solar is projected to make up more than one third of the NEM at 83 GW, and this will be complemented by 60 GW of rooftop solar, 15 GW of gas peakers and 7 GW of hydro. In addition, large-scale storage and Consumer Energy Resources (CER) are expected to increase by more than 10 times between now and 2040. AEMO’s projections for the future energy mix are based on the technologies that are proven today. New technologies may emerge over time – small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) and hydrogen are two examples – and it is appropriate that we continue to watch the technical and commercial progress of a range of technologies to assess whether they could be viable for this market in the future. This evolution in the energy mix is affecting the way the market functions. Let me share some examples. In June 2022, Australia found itself in the middle of an energy crisis. A very volatile period globally for all energy-related commodity prices combined with significant domestic coal plant outages and sustained wet weather that lowered wind and solar generation, and had an impact on coal supply and delivery. Gas peaking power plants ran very hard to cover the shortfall in supply, and for the first time in history, the market operator suspended the market to maintain stability and guard against blackouts. In Autumn of this year, a cold snap on the east coast prompted a spike in electricity demand in what is usually a subdued shoulder period. At the same time, a sustained wind drought across the southern states coincided with coal plant outages, low solar generation and low hydro availability due to Tasmania’s drought, causing a spike in wholesale electricity prices. There was a significant draw on gas for power generation, and this created very real concerns about the drawdown of gas from storage heading into winter. Then most recently, in early October, we saw two extremes in a matter of days. First, a new record set for minimum electricity demand in New South Wales due to mild weather and sunny skies. Rooftop solar met over half of the state’s total generation at the time, with black coal supplying just over 20 per cent, and grid-based renewable energy almost 20 per cent. Then, just two days later, temperatures were high and AEMO warned of a likely lack of energy reserves in Queensland, with demand forecast to outstrip supply. These warnings were successful as a signal for increased generation and demand was met. These examples show the significant variability in conditions, and complexity we face, in meeting the energy needs of our nation – within each day, across each state, given variability in weather, with changing patterns of energy usage, and with continuing uncertainty around plant performance and reliability, particularly the ageing coal fleet. And so, I think all market participants recognise that the system is not optimally structured to manage these challenges into the future. This is even more evident when you consider system variability will become more pronounced with growth in large-scale renewables, and the march of rooftop solar at an annual rate that continues to outstrip even the most bullish estimates. At the same time, demand for electricity will grow significantly with the electrification of homes, businesses and transport as the nation pursues further emissions reductions and with projected growth in data centres driven by artificial intelligence. The NEM 2.0 The challenges before us are clear, as are the opportunities to make good policy decisions that will deliver on emissions reduction along with good outcomes for energy consumers. Which brings me to the opportunity before us to redesign the NEM. Origin welcomes the post-2030 review which is a timely and important piece of reform – noting that we are currently awaiting the terms of reference. It is important that we learn the lessons from previous attempts at reform such as the NEM 2025 program that was constrained in its effectiveness by unhelpful rhetoric and lack of consensus across governments and the sector, on both the challenges and potential solutions. To reach the 82 per cent renewable target by 2030, AEMO estimates 32 GW of utility scale renewable energy will need to be built. If we use an average project size of 500 MW, that is 65 projects over 5.5 years or 5.8 GW per year. The maximum build-out achieved in a rolling 12-month period historically is around 4.3 GW. The energy transition does not end in 2030, it is a multi-decade transformation of every aspect of the energy supply chain. Therefore, this review is important because it needs to facilitate significant infrastructure, investment and outcomes in the period beyond 2030. To maintain consistency with net zero 2050 targets, and retiring capacity and demand growth, a further 72 GW of utility scale renewable energy is required. This is more than twice the already significant task to meet the 2030 target. We will also need thousands more kilometres of transmission to connect renewables to the grid. As mentioned already, 15 GW of gas peaking power stations will be required to manage extended renewable shortfall periods, like the wind drought we had earlier this year, working alongside battery storage and pumped hydro, to maintain reliability. I recognise that long-term planning of this nature can be hard given the immediate challenges in front of us. Political cycles are short-term, so too is the focus of some classes of investors. This short-termism is wholly incompatible with the world of energy and the challenges we need to address. We need long-term vision and stability of policy settings so we can make long-term investment decisions, with certainty. This enables delivery of the energy supply our nation needs, at the time it’s needed, and underpins the choices that add the least cost to the system. So, what are the priorities for a redesigned NEM that can help Australia meet its goal to be net zero by 2050? What key challenges need to be solved? First, the NEM as it is currently designed is no longer driving the required investment in new generation. A fundamental priority for the NEM design must be establishing settings that send a signal to market participants that drives investment in the right mix of technologies required to deliver reliable electricity supply at least cost – avoiding the need for government interventions. This is always important but becomes critically so over the medium term, when electricity demand is projected to increase significantly. Currently, much of the heavy lifting in delivering investment for the transition is being driven by government schemes, such as the Commonwealth’s Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) and the New South Wales Roadmap, both with very ambitious targets out to 2030. These are short-term, tactical schemes to meet 2030 emissions targets, and they sit outside of the market. The CIS also explicitly excludes gas, an important part of the technology mix, and for which investment is not encouraged by current market settings. We therefore need enduring market settings that ensure sufficient investment over the coming decades in the right technologies, including flexible dispatchable plant such as gas fired peaking power generation, that may run infrequently but are required to support the market as coal progressively retires and variable renewable energy gets built out. Options that facilitate market-led investment, while providing governments with sufficient confidence around reliability and carbon abatement goals, should be prioritised. Reforms that build on the existing NEM framework but help de-risk a proportion of a project’s future revenue in an inherently variable market environment would be consistent with this approach. A well-designed capacity mechanism could assist with this and should be one of the reform options for consideration. A capacity mechanism that allows for the procurement of capacity through competitive auction processes could provide a direct, transparent, and certain means of meeting government reliability objectives, while also supporting the investment case. Importantly, such a mechanism could be designed to supplement, rather than replace the existing NEM framework, with generators still principally reliant on spot and contract markets for revenue. The NEM is now somewhat of a global outlier with its energy-only design and absence of a distinct, long-term mechanism incorporated into the broader market design to value and incentivise capacity. This will be crucial as the market becomes increasingly volatile and unpredictable. Capacity mechanisms are commonplace in U.S., European, and U.K. markets and provide revenue certainty to plant that are not called upon frequently but are required in an increasingly variable system to balance the market when renewables and storage cannot. Secondly, the market design will need to consider how system security is best provided as coal plants retire. I assure you that I will not get too technical here, but this is an important issue that needs to be addressed. The large spinning generators fuelled by coal and gas not only provide electricity to the market, they also provide the system strength and inertia that keeps the electricity system voltage and frequency stable. As I highlighted with those earlier examples, challenges in keeping the energy system secure are already becoming evident as variable renewable energy increases, and as coal plants retire. South Australia provides a case study, with high variable renewable energy output and no coal plants. AEMO is forced to intervene regularly in this market to direct gas generators to provide system security to avoid the risk of blackouts. In fact, directions were in place for a staggering 65 per cent of the time in South Australia in the fourth quarter of 2023. The phenomenon of minimum demand has also emerged as an issue. This is where, as more demand is being met by behind the meter resources such as rooftop solar, supply from grid-based resources is being reduced despite these being needed for system security. Directions by AEMO, which were only ever intended to be used infrequently, are disruptive and can undermine the efficient operation and value of generation assets. To minimise the reliance on such interventions, it is crucial that markets and price signals are developed for the delivery of the required system services in the most efficient manner. Thirdly, the market design needs to be equipped to support continued growth in Consumer Energy Resources, and importantly to manage these resources efficiently. Consumer Energy Resources include rooftop solar and other behind the meter assets like household batteries and electric vehicles. Virtual power plants can play an important role in aggregating these distributed energy resources and orchestrating them in a way that efficiently balances supply and demand. Harnessing aggregated energy assets to shift energy loads to different times of the day when energy is abundant is one way to avoid investment in additional grid scale infrastructure and reduce the overall cost of the transition for customers. A further consideration is ensuring the orchestration of distributed assets is simple for customers to participate in, and that there are mechanisms or incentives to encourage and reward their participation. Addressing the urgent gas supply challenge To understand the significant consequences of extended periods of policy uncertainty or poorly designed market interventions, then look no further than the east coast gas market. In my CEDA Address two years ago, one of the six priorities I focused on was the need for action on policy to support new supply in southern states to help offset dwindling supply from Victorian gas fields. These concerns have been repeatedly echoed by industry participants, regulators, analysts and other experts on gas, and the calls for action have become louder and increasingly urgent. Let me reiterate today, urgent policy action is needed if we are to avoid the worst impacts of gas shortfalls on the Australian economy. A gas shortage would have material impacts on our nation given millions of people rely on gas to cook, heat water and heat their homes, and to underpin the competitiveness of their businesses. For some businesses, gas is a feedstock for their industrial processes for which there is no viable replacement today. Further, as I have pointed out, gas is important to the security of electricity supply. A lack of gas for power generation on any given day could have major consequences and undermine support for the energy transition. While we recognise the continued role of gas in the energy mix is not something everyone supports, solving our nation’s energy challenges requires pragmatism. It has become increasingly evident globally, that more time is needed to plan for the transition away from gas, allowing time for households and businesses to electrify and for technology advancements to develop. We also must recognise gas supply is needed to serve the 15 GW of gas generation critical to firm renewables and provide system security. Gas and coal are the only technologies today that can keep the lights on when we have extended periods – days, not hours – of cloud cover, low wind and drought. Given the short time to address shortfalls, the solutions available are limited. But this should not prevent us from making good policy decisions that address the core problem – supply – with a combination of short- and medium-term solutions that can restore gas security. Some have called for LNG export controls. However, this would be a retrograde action and incredibly damaging to Australia’s reputation as a safe and stable place to invest, and a reliable energy trade partner for our neighbours in Asia. The pace of the energy transition is at least as big an issue for our neighbours as it is here, and they will be reliant on our gas exports for decades to come. We also cannot expect that Queensland gas alone can continue to meet the gap from declining southern production. The options available to bring more gas into southern states quickly are: Pipeline upgrades. Encouraging investment in pipelines could allow movement of greater volumes of gas from the point of production to the demand and storage centres. Regasification terminals. LNG regasification terminals are an efficient way of moving gas around the country. Origin’s view is we are likely to need a regasification terminal, at the very least as an insurance mechanism. These are difficult investments to make with current market settings. Projects typically need to be underpinned by 10+ year offtake contracts, but these agreements are challenging given the considerable financial risk anduncertainty around domestic gas policy. Governments and industry may need to work together to partially underwrite these investments and share risk. Accelerate approval of gas projects. Given the lead times from investment decision to first gas, new projects will not address any imminent shortfall. However, they are critical to delivering secure gas supply for customers and the electricity market over the medium term and approvals should be accelerated as a priority, supported by the appropriate checks and balances. Each of these solutions require additional gas storage in the south. With all of that said, I would like to acknowledge a recent shift in the dialogue on gas. The Commonwealth’s Future Gas Strategy is an important first step, but it must be backed up with tangible actions that drive outcomes. We welcomed the Victorian Government’s decision to allow gas storage off its coast, and it is encouraging that the South Australian Government has introduced legislation that could support the development of gas peaking generation. The forthcoming reviews of the gas Mandatory Gas Code of Conduct and Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism (ADGSM) are important opportunities to restore market signals and drive the investment urgently needed to avoid gas shortfalls. Conclusion To conclude, this is a time of great challenge, great change and enormous opportunity – not only for the energy sector, but indeed, for Australia as a whole. I am optimistic, but also cautious, about the path ahead. My optimism comes from the opportunity we have to underpin the future prosperity of our nation through delivering the transition and ensuring a well-functioning energy system for all. There are promising signs of progress over the past 18 months on renewables, storage and transmission infrastructure, as the industry has demonstrated its willingness to lean into the challenges and keep forging forward. There are recent green shoots on much needed gas market policy. And, we are galvanised around the shared ambition to be net zero by 2050. But at the same time, I am a realist. A long career in energy indicates the path ahead is unlikely to be straightforward. For close to 20 years, progress on energy has been hamstrung by political division, policy delays and interventions which have delivered poor outcomes. This is not merely a frustration, there are very real and material costs to late and poor decisions, as we are now experiencing in gas markets. While I am disappointed to say we have at times become resigned to these shortcomings, it does not have to be this way. We have a choice. As leaders, we can choose to align to shared goals for the greater good, and we can choose not to pander to fringe voices and vested interests. We can choose to elevate the public discourse on energy to a level that befits how critically important it is to our economic and social wellbeing. And, we can choose to make the hard decisions on energy policy – not place them back in the too hard basket. We are not asking governments to step in and solve everything. But we do need governments to work with us to set up the frameworks that enable the industry to get on with it. Because I believe the industry has shown its commitment to the task, a willingness to continue to innovate, and we have the capital and expertise to get the job done. If we can achieve this, I am confident we can return our energy markets to the place they occupied for many decades: stable and secure, and delivering good outcomes for all Australians.

    "title": "Reviewing 12 dispatch intervals in South Australia on Monday 23rd September 2024 (Part 3 of a Case Study)",
    "date": "04-11-2024 06:59:00 PM",
    "content": "Yesterday we published ‘ Taking a look inside South Australia’s lengthy run of volatility on Monday 23rd September 2024 ’, as Part 2 of a Case Study into what happened on Monday 23rd September 2024 in South Australia. In this follow-on article, we take the next step in understanding what happened, and why… (A) The run of prices With respect to price outcomes, we sum up Part 2 as follows: During the day on Monday 23rd September 2024 Synopsis of SA price outcomes Early morning. There were some elevated prices through until sunrise – but that’s not our focus here. Sunlight hours. High yield of solar PV (particularly rooftop PV) drove prices down, and exports from SA to VIC. Evening. It was evening volatility where we will focus : (a) This began at 17:50 ( NEM time ) with the price at $3,499.99/MWh – up from $286.89/MWh at 17:45 (b) and ended at 20:30 ( NEM time ) with the price at $8,800.01/MWh – before dropping to $560.04/MWh at 20:35 Into the night. As noted in Part 2 , the price continued to bounce up to approx $1,000/MWh through until 23:05. (B) Exploring some dispatch intervals With a collage of widgets in ez2view , and Time-Travel back to these evening periods, we take a look at what’s visible over dispatch intervals beginning 17:50 ( NEM time ) … i.e. just before prices jumped above $1,000/MWh: 17:45 dispatch interval In this collage, we include a number of widgets: 1) The ‘Current Bids’ widget on the left is filtered down to only show bids for ENERGY from SA units, and is stacked from low price to high price for the dispatch interval; 2) The ‘SA Schematic’ widget shows trended FinalMW for all units in South Australia … remembering that (since IESS ) all consumption is a negative quantity 3) The ‘NEM Overview Map’ widget provides an overview 4) Underneath that shows: (a) The ‘Gen Change’ widget shows change in FinalMW from the prior dispatch interval to this one; and (b) The ‘Bound Constraints’ widget shows constraint equations currently bound in this dispatch interval, and the Constraint Sets they are invoked in. The display is annotated to highlight a number of things: In particular note: 1) In the bid stack, there is almost no volume bid in ‘green’ price ranges (i.e. between $0/MWh and $300/MWh): (a) Which is not a surprise, given prior discussion – such as in this ‘Updated trend of ‘ENERGY’ bids in red, green and blue’ article from April 2024. (b) and which helps explain the steep price escalation seen through the evening with just slight changes in the supply-demand balance. 2) For this particular dispatch interval, we see that the AGLHAL unit has a primary role in setting the Dispatch Price in South Australia for the 17:45 dispatch interval …. noting this is separated from the VIC Price because of the ‘ Economic Island ’ being formed. 3) We see the role of the interconnectors being constrained: (a) In Part 1 we noted that flows west on ‘Heywood’ were strong, but up at the Export Limit; (b) But we did not comment on Murraylink, which is flowing west at a much lower level, due to the ‘V^SML_BUDP_3’ Constraint Equation that’s bound …. more about that one in a subsequent piece of this Case Study. 4) We also see three units in particular that are of interest: (a) In this dispatch interval, all three units (BOLIVPS1, PPCCGT and SNAPPER1) have output; (b) But they are all subject to the ‘S_PPT+SNPT+BLVR_220’ Constraint Equation that’s bound …. more about that one in a subsequent piece of this Case Study. 17:50 dispatch interval Moving along to the next dispatch interval, the price spikes: The price is set by the bid at Lake Bonney BESS. 17:55 dispatch interval The price drops when the ‘Heywood’ link unbinds: This is because the ‘Economic Island’ no longer exists … it’s a Price Setter outside of SA that sets the ENERGY Price in SA (so not shown in the filtered ‘Current Bids’ widget in the image). 18:00 dispatch interval The Heywood link again binds, and prices separate again: In this instance, its the Hornsdale Power Reserve that sets the price with its bid at $9,899.50/MWh at the RRN … note that there’s not much volume between that (below) and the bid for Lake Bonney BESS we saw before then (not many price bands with volume in them). That’s pretty normal up at the spicy end of the price curve. 18:05 dispatch interval There’s quite a bid changes taking effect for the 18:05 dispatch interval (i.e. the $ symbols on the schematic) … but note that invariably some of them will be ‘noise bids’. It’s still Hornsdale Power Reserve setting the price. 18:10 dispatch interval At 18:10, prices drop substantially (even with Heywood still bound at its Export Limit), with Torrens Island BESS setting the price: We can see some movement of bid volumes for Angaston and Port Stanvac, amongst others. 18:15 dispatch interval The price spikes again, and we’re back to Hornsdale Power Reserve setting the price. Note that the ‘Market Demand’ for South Australia has increased : 1) From 1,509MW at 18:10; 2) To 1,573MW at 18:15 … which would be one factor contributing to the jump in price. 18:20 dispatch interval The price increases further – to $15,599.60/MWh (for the first time this evening), with Torrens Island BESS setting the price. Note that there’s still considerable volume (for BESS and fossil fuelled peakers) above this point – but not many price bands, other than at the Market Price Cap. 18:25 dispatch interval The price settles in at the same level ($15,599.60/MWh), so with Torrens Island BESS setting the price. More movement of volume in bid bands seen. 18:30 dispatch interval The same price outcome and price setter: Note the movement of 50MW of volume for QPS5 (at Quarantine peaker) from the MPC bid band down to the $17,099/MWh bid band* – presumably as part of an attempt to get more volume if the price moves higher. * remember that these bid bands are set at ‘ Gate Closure #1 ‘ the day before – so consider the forethought required to have a bid band only $401/MWh below the MPC! 18:35 dispatch interval The same price outcome and price setter: Note, in this dispatch interval, AGL adds 50MW to the ‘Price Setting’ bid band, taking it to 100MW offered at $15,599.60 (of which only 6MW gets a Band Target). 18:40 dispatch interval The same price outcome and price setter: Some small shuffling of volume in bid bands seen. So that’s where will leave it, in Part 3 of this evolving Case Study about what happened on Monday 23rd September 2024 in South Australia . Stay tuned for more…",

    "title": "Taking a look inside South Australia’s lengthy run of volatility on Monday 23rd September 2024 (Part 2 of a Case Study)",
    "date": "03-11-2024 01:00:00 PM",
    "content": "As it happened on the day, we posted about the ‘Evening blast of spot price volatility in South Australia on Monday 23rd September 2024’ : That was almost 6 weeks ago, today. However since that time we’ve had our attention drawn back to the same event on several occasions: 1) In some instances we had clients asking us about what we’d seen happening at the time; 2) In some instances we’ve had that instance featured in a bit of a Case Study to assist in training new clients in how to use our ez2view software. … so I thought it might be worth providing a bit more of a record here in this Case Study Part 2 (calling that first article Part 1) … and Part 3+more which will follow. (A) Recapping at a high level The snapshot from NEMwatch at the 19:00 dispatch interval ( NEM time ) in the contemporaneous article highlighted some of the broader contributing factors: 1) Constraints on the Heywood interconnector limiting further imports from VIC 2) Limited production from VRE , by virtue of: (a) The volatility proceeding well past sunset – so removing solar PV (both Small Solar and Large Solar) from the equation; and (b) Low wind production across South Australia at the time. But it’s probably worth starting with this chart from the ‘Trends Engine’ inside of ez2view to sum up some other high-level parameters: With respect to the above: 1) The pricing in South Australia: (a) Was somewhat elevated even in the morning period; (b) But it was evening volatility that gained most attention: i. This began at 17:50 ( NEM time ) with the price at $3,499.99/MWh – up from $286.89/MWh at 17:45 ii. and ended at 20:30 ( NEM time ) with the price at $8,800.01/MWh – before dropping to $560.04/MWh at 20:35 iii. but, even afterwards, through to 23:05 note that the price still bounced up to ~$1,000/MWh on a number of occasions. 2) All the while prices in other regions were much more subdued. … so moving on… (B) Interconnector limitations Remember that the VIC-SA interconnector (which is commonly called ‘Heywood’) is the representation of flow from the Victorian RRN to the South Australian RRN (for instance, with the dynamic inter-regional losses on the line calculated across the entire flow path, not just the cables that cross the VIC-SA border). With interconnector convention being positive flow being west, we’ve again used the ‘Trends Engine’ inside of ez2view to sum up the contribution of the interconnector during the period of the price volatility in South Australia: In summary: 1) During peak sunlight periods, because solar yield is oversized relative to ‘ Underlying Demand ’ (less an allowance for the remaining ‘Keeping the Lights on Services’ required to be supplied by generation plant), South Australia is strong on exports to Victoria: … up to the ‘Import Limit’ (i.e. referenced to VIC) in the middle of the day 2) But during morning and evening, with solar much declined (and also due to low wind yield) the ‘lowest cost*’ outcome NEMDE sees is to minimise use of local supply options and instead import as much lower-cost generation from Victoria (and hence further afield) as possible. (a) * i.e. this is ‘cost’ inside of the NEMDE model looking at bid prices as a direct proxy for cost (and it’s not always perfectly correlated with cost paid by end consumers) (b) but note that the ‘Export Limit’ (i.e. referenced to VIC) is only ~600MW through this period, whereas the ‘ Market Demand ’ in South Australia is ~1,700MW in the NEMwatch snapshot for the 19:00 dispatch interval above. … this means that South Australia needs to dispatch the ‘next cheapest’ supply options in South Australia to meet the gap. We sometimes use the term ‘ Economic Island ’ to describe this situation. (C) Aggregate Bid Stacks From the perspective of closing that gap, let’s now use the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view to take a look at the supply stack on an aggregate basis: In these trends we’ve chosen to span three days (i.e. Sunday 22nd September 2024 , Monday 23rd September 2024 and Tuesday 24th September 2024 ) in order to highlight some differences in bids – and hence dispatch outcomes. … if you have time, you might want to read through the linked articles for each of those days in order to understand some key differences, as background. Now let’s break the bids down into ‘Fuel Types’ in order to see where we should be focused (C1) Supply from VRE (Variable Renewable Energy) A commonly used term is VRE … but we’ve also commonly called this ‘ Anytime/Anywhere Energy ’ to better capture the structure of incentives commonly used in its development. (C1a) Supply from VRE (Wind Generation) Here’s a trended Bid Stack view across all of the Semi-Scheduled Wind Farms (plus some Non-Scheduled Wind Farms that operate like Semi-Scheduled Wind Farms from a NEMDE perspective): We’ve highlighted that the two periods of price volatility – evenings of Monday 23rd September 2024 and Tuesday 24th September 2024 – coincide with very low levels of aggregate Wind UIGF . Clearly one contributing factor. (C1b) Supply from VRE (Large Solar Generation) Here’s a trend of aggregate bids for Large Solar in South Australia over this three day period: As noted on the image, the spot price volatility occurred when the late afternoon Large Solar yield had almost completely set for each evening. (C1c) Supply from VRE (Medium and Small Solar Generation) A quick reminder that: 1) ‘Small Solar’ (the term we use to describe rooftop PV with an installed size of under 100kW (so eligible for SRES) is only partially visible , in estimated output data. 2) ‘Medium Solar’ (the term we use to describe distributed PV above 100kW (so not visible in SRES data) but below ~20MW (so not captured in AEMO dispatch data) is even more invisible . However the supply shape for these options won’t have been too dissimilar to the Large Solar above – so not of material consequence in much of the period of volatility. (C2) Supply from Firming A commonly used term is Firming … but we’ve also commonly called this ‘Keeping the Lights on Services’ to emphasise the purpose of this supply, and to also remind that it’s not just about the energy that’s supplied by this Firming Capacity. We’ll walk through each of these in turn, in a slightly different order than normal: (C2a) Supply from Firming (Liquid-Fired Generation) Here’s a view of the capacity of liquid-fuelled generators in South Australia: There’s unused capacity (i.e. above the black-line trace of output) that’s priced in the deep red colour, signifying bids up towards the Market Price Cap . (C2b) Supply from Firming (Batteries) Here’s a view of the capacity of batteries (as Bi-Directional Units) in South Australia, noting that : There’s unused capacity (i.e. above the black-line trace of output) that’s priced in the deep red colour, signifying bids up towards the Market Price Cap . (C2c) Supply from Firming (Negawatts) Negawatts are a supply-side (virtual) commodity created by the introduction of the WDRM in 2021 (roughly 3 years ago today). It’s been a (surprising?) disappointment to some – however to others (like me) there’s been no surprise, as it’s performed along the lines of what was expected (i.e. not much at all). For instance, here’s the supply stack of negawatts in South Australia over those three days: As highlighted, there was 7MW of negawatts registered for ENERGY in South Australia at this time … but none of it even offered bids for the attractive prices (Monday 23rd September 2024 and Tuesday 24th September 2024 ). (C2d) Supply from Firming (Gas-Fired Generation) Last but certainly not least, here’s a view of trended bids for gas-fired units in South Australia over this three-day period: What really jumps out as quite visible is the sizeable volume bid down at the Market Price Floor (i.e. down at –$1,000/MWh) which still does not get dispatched in this instance … both through Monday 23rd September 2024 and Tuesday 24th September 2024 . Now continued… On Monday 4th November 2024 we posted ‘Reviewing 12 dispatch intervals in South Australia on Monday 23rd September 2024 ‘ as Part 3 in this evolving Case Study.",

AEMO has not yet estimated the latest time it would need to intervene through an AEMO intervention event. Manager NEM Real Time Operations ——————————————————————- END OF REPORT ——————————————————————-‘ Note the relatively low level of assessed capacity reserve at this point. Readers should remember that the purpose of these forecasts of LOR2 is to elicit a market response . 1) So the tight supply-demand balance may not eventuate; 2) Though readers might read into this a heightened chance of some price action on Thursday afternoon and evening. Contributing Factor #1) Planned outages at some coal units Here’s a snapshot of the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view as at Saturday 2nd November 2024 looking forward to Thursday 7th November 2024 , highlighting a number of planned outages of coal units: 1) There are planned outages at 9 (of 44 currently operational) coal units ; 2) Which is normal … remembering that these shoulder seasons have traditionally been ‘outage seasons’ , though these sorts of rules of thumb are increasingly challenged as the energy transition rolls on. Across all three of the largest regions there are coal units with 1) In NSW we have planned outages at Bayswater 2, Eraring 3, and Vales Point 6 2) In QLD we have planned outages at Callide B2, Gladstone 2, Kogan Creek (which came off this morning, as planned), and Tarong unit 2 … noting Tarong unit 1 is planned to be back in service (just!) on Thursday 7th November 2024 (so there might be some stakeholders sweating on that) 3) In VIC we have planned outages at Loy Yang A2 and Yallourn unit 1. Contributing Factor #2) Forecast poor (Solar and) Wind Yield on Thursday afternoon/evening Here’s a collage of a couple ‘ Forecast Convergence ’ widgets in ez2view looking at forecast UIGF for Wind across the NEM, and UIGF for Large Solar across the NEM: Remember that this widget allows the user to ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to ‘see that other dimension of time ’. As highlighted on the image: 1) At the top, we see poor and getting poorer forecast UIGF for Wind Capability right across the NEM for Thursday 7th November afternoon and evening. 2) Whilst it’s obvious that there’ll be no solar yield after sunset, we can see (at the bottom) that the forecast UIGF for Solar Capability is lower than neighbouring days right across the NEM for Thursday 7th November afternoon, and into evening sunset. Does not make a great combination with many coal units on planned outage. Contributing Factor #3) Demand Flipping the context to the ‘ Forecast Convergence ’ widgets in ez2view to look at NEM-wide ‘ Market Demand ’ (at the top) and Surplus (at the bottom) we see that Thursday 7th November afternoon and evening clearly stands out: As highlighted on the image: 1) At the top, we see much higher ‘Market Demand’ for Thursday 7th November afternoon and evening than other days in this 14-day period (excepting Wednesday 8th November ). 2) At the bottom we also see the NEM-wide aggregate Surplus is down around 0MW for Thursday 7th November afternoon and evening. … though caveats about the idiosyncrasies of the ST PASA process for determining Surplus! More food for thought… Contributing Factor #4) Network outages Also affected by ‘outage season’ is the transmission network – as we see in this ‘ Constraint Sets ’ widget Gantt-chart display that is filtered down: 1) For Constraint Sets containing Constraint Equations with VIC1-NSW1 on the LHS … 2) and also excluding many System Normal constraint sets.

Yesterday afternoon our copies of ez2view did alert us to the restart of the STWF1 unit, just prior to the 16:40 dispatch interval ( NEM time ): … but we did not note at the time. So we’re doing so on Saturday 2nd November 2024 with an additional snapshot of the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view focused back 2 days from this point: In the dispatch interval highlighted (i.e. 16:30) in the table, we see the unit was given a small Target, but the turbines were a little slower to get a start … it was not until the 16:35 dispatch interval that its actual Output ramped up (slightly lower than the Target). Eagle eyes will spot some periods earlier in the day when the unit had some Availability, but 0MW Target – this was because it was being ‘constrained down’ by a several different constraint equations , with one of the primary culprits being the ‘N>>BDBU_970_051’ constraint equation : 1) Which is related to an outage on the Bundey to Buronga (6F) 330kV line; and 2) … which I’m surprised we’ve not written about before.",

    "date": "01-11-2024 12:18:00 PM",
    "content": "It’s hart to resist making a hunch on the reason(s?) for the Glitch in P30 demand forecast for QLD on Tuesday evening 29th October 2024 . To sum up the glitch: There was one quirky forecast issued at 18:30, for the 19:00 half-hour period and beyond. Following this, the next three forecasts were all “flat”, until about 04:30 Flat until 04:30, first 30-minute period of the next trading day, where they meet up with the earlier forecasts. Here’s a complimentary view, using the ‘chart’ mode of ez2view’s Forecast Convergence (the vertical dotted line represents the point in time of 20:45): We received a suggestion to look into the PV forecasts (rooftop , we assumed). Yet for the rooftop PV forecasts to be in error by the equivalent amount we’d need cover the MW difference charted above – more than 2,000 MW. But we don’t observe that in the chart of the rooftop PV forecasts, below. So we conclude, on this occasion, the rooftop PV forecasts don’t explain the demand forecast glitches. Moreover the glitches were from around 7pm onwards – after daylight hours in QLD. With PV off the table for now, I thought I’d offer my own hunch: That the temperature sensitive component of demand in the model somehow went missing. Purely by visual inspection, the three main glitchy forecasts all appear to take a generally flat trajectory. They sit at a level equivalent to the overnight minimum at around 04:00. If we took simplistic view of the demand forecast as including a component tied to weather-dependent human activity, and a component tied to ‘usually always on’ demand. The latter component may still change with time but not respond to weather. The human component would be temperature-sensitive, and generally fall away to a small level when most people are asleep – hence the overnight minimum that we typically see would be driven by the ‘usually always on’ demand. If the human component was missing from the forecast, might we get a flat forecast sitting at that low 4am level? Could this be the reason?",

    "title": "BESS market operations: We need to talk about being scheduled",
    "date": "01-11-2024 11:54:00 AM",
    "content": "Editor’s Note – This article is based on a presentation by James Tetlow at All-Energy Australia 2024 in Melbourne on October 24, 2024. The presentation explored the challenges, risks, and opportunities for Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) operating as Scheduled assets in the National Electricity Market (NEM). James’ talk was the one of 4 presentations that Paul noted in his article ‘‘Operating in the NEM’ … from All Energy 2024’ . Why is this important? The operating experience of most people working in the energy transition has been gained from Semi-scheduled wind and solar farms, but many of those people are now developing and planning to operate Scheduled storage assets. For the transition to succeed, it’s vital to understand the important differences between operating Scheduled compared to Semi-scheduled assets. Scheduled vs. Semi-scheduled Operating in the NEM as a Scheduled asset is a significant step-up in commercial opportunity but also in risk and obligation. The need to plan and execute to your plan is greater, and whilst the commercial opportunities are greater so are the commercial risks. There is also a greater role for automation, but in turn that needs more human skills and experience to oversee. There is no “semi” in Scheduled; it’s a serious operational commitment. Semi scheduled. There is no semi in Scheduled A flying analogy The differences between operating Semi-scheduled and Scheduled assets can be illustrated with the analogy of a glider and a commercial jet plane. Like soaring in a glider, Semi-scheduled units have some freedom to follow the natural flow of weather patterns, they may be bound by certain restrictions or caps but within those boundaries they generally follow the natural resources. In the NEM, Semi-scheduled assets glide with natural conditions like a glider, while Scheduled assets require the precision, planning and control of a jet. Images courtesy of Wikipedia. Operating as a Scheduled asset can be compared to flying a jet plane—where precision matters, and every deviation has consequences. Scheduled operations are higher risk and need tighter planning and control. Success demands mastery over dispatch, careful market timing, and the ability to quickly respond to changing conditions. There’s no gliding through Scheduled operations. Three Pillars of Scheduled Operations Let’s focus on three particularly important differences between the two types of operation. #1 Planning and Control: Every Action Matters Semi-scheduled wind and solar must follow rules. They must meet PASA obligations, forecast conditions accurately, and adhere to dispatch caps. Much like a glider navigating designated airspace and adjusting to shifting winds, Semi-scheduled generators respond to environmental conditions and mistakes do still carry consequences, but these assets have some flexibility. With a passenger jet, every start and every turn, every take-off and landing is planned, agreed with the air traffic control tower and must be executed as per the plan. Scheduled operations also require planning and precise control. Every dispatch interval is deliberate, with strategies in place to handle market fluctuations and unforeseen events. In scheduled operations, every step must align with the plan—like a flight path gone wrong, small deviations can lead to costly consequences. Image courtesy of The Canberra Times. Just as a pilot makes a plan, shares the plan with air traffic control and sticks to the plan, operators of Scheduled assets must also accurately forecast their output now and in the future and ensure their output follows their plan, with deviations of less than 6MW. When Things Go Wrong If you are a Semi-scheduled wind or solar farm, there are consequences to getting things wrong. There are clear PASA obligations, real-time forecasting is crucial, and you must respect a Semi-Dispatch Cap, but there is certainly more latitude. You are, after all, only half, or Semi -scheduled. But there is no half or semi- in Scheduled operations. Get your PASA forecasts wrong, and you can expect trouble. Like Pelican Point’s inaccurate STPASA submissions in 2017, which were off by just 96 MW—and cost the owners $900,000. Pelican Point was fined $900,000 for four incorrect ST PASA submisisons And you must follow your target all the time, not just during a Semi-Dispatch Cap. So, there are significant differences and failure to understand and respect these has significant financial consequences. But planning and precision are only part of the equation – navigating the financial landscape of Scheduled operations brings its own set of challenges. #2 Commercial Complexity: Juggling Markets and Managing Risks Complexity A Scheduled storage asset typically needs multiple revenue streams across energy and Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) markets. A bit like the complexity of a full-service airline selling multiple classes of comfort with dynamic pricing whilst also managing highly variable operating costs. Conversely, a Semi-scheduled generator needs to think only of energy – 1 bid with 10 price bands. Semi-scheduled assets (Top) operate with 10 simple price bands, while Scheduled assets (Bottom) must navigate the complexity of multiple markets and bid bands—balancing FCAS, energy markets, and state-of-charge strategies in real time. Images courtesy of Overwatch Energy. A Fine-Tuned Balancing Act Scheduled operations demand constant vigilance . Operators must track multiple services— eight contingency markets, two regulation markets, and the energy markets, and not just right now. To be any good at this, you need to also forecast prices and be aware of your State of Charge and any warranty limitations. And, just like an airline that balances passenger classes to optimize profit, BESS operators need to determine every 5 minutes where the best value is – how to co-optimize across energy and FCAS markets . So, great opportunity for value, but far more complex, and far riskier. But why more risky? With extra reward comes extra risk These extra markets offer more financial reward, but they also bring extra financial risk that requires constant management. Let’s look at two in particular. You could buy energy at $17,500/MWh While Semi-scheduled assets worry about prices dropping to – $1,000/MWh , Scheduled BESS must prepare for the possibility of buying energy at $17,500/MWh . Nobody should be buying energy at $17,500/MWh, but you now have that opportunity. Failure to Deliver the Services You are now earning money selling ancillary services, but the services are technically complex. What if you don’t deliver them? Here are some examples of what happens: 2021: CS Energy for failures in 2019 and 2020 at Callide B and Gladstone re FCAS Contingency: $200k and repaid $1.3m. 2022: Hornsdale for failures in 2019 re FCAS Contingency Services: $900k. 2023: AGL, various units for failures between 2018 – 2020 re Contingency FCAS. $6million. The risks of non-compliance are real—penalties like the $1.3 million repayment from CS Energy and the $900,000 fine for Hornsdale Power Reserve highlight the high stakes of failing to meet operational obligations. Images courtesy of the AER website. So you may be taking the money, but if you are not actively checking your technical outputs, then one or two years later you might having a difficult conversation with your investors. Can you please return your dividend because some while ago someone did a software upgrade on site that we didn’t control. When you register and commit to providing these services then, you must ensure those services are available. #3 Automation and Human Expertise: The Perfect Balance A passenger jet uses sophisticated hardware, software, and autopilot systems to manage routine operations. But no one suggests you don’t also need a skilled and experienced pilot for a passenger jet. Similarly automation for Scheduled operations is essential. But it can’t solve everything . Automated systems handle routine dispatch, co-optimize energy and FCAS participation , and should support compliance with the NEM’s rules. Automation helps operators manage the rapid pace of the NEM’s five-minute settlement cycles , but it’s not enough on its own. Just as a pilot is essential to talk to air traffic control and take over when automation fails, skilled operators are essential to talk to AEMO and network Service Providers and manage outages and problems. Success in the NEM requires more than just smart algorithms—it depends on humans for routine operations and when things don’t go according to plan. In Scheduled operations, just like in a cockpit, success depends on having the right people in control—those you can trust to make quick, informed decisions when it matters most. Image courtesy of Smithsonian Magazine . Perhaps counter-intuitively, the more complex the system and the greater the reliance on automation, the more critical it becomes to have experienced operators who can act swiftly and decisively when needed. Key Takeaways: Your Flight Plan for Success in the NEM Expect to see lots more Scheduled units in the NEM. That could be great news for the energy transition, but only if the differences with Semi-scheduled are understood and managed. So: Don’t try and fly a passenger jet with a gliders licence: If you are new to Scheduled assets then upskill your staff. Airline revenue is more complex and riskier than gliding revenue: Understand the services you are selling and constantly check you are delivering them. Think carefully about who you put in the cockpit: More complex Scheduled operations require more, not less, human experience. James Tetlow is an Executive Director at Overwatch Energy.

    "title": "Managing an electricity portfolio in the NEM",
    "date": "01-11-2024 10:48:00 AM",
    "content": "In earlier articles for WattClarity, I examined both how retailers normally hedge and generators often hedge by explaining the usual contracting approach. This is well known to those involved in energy trading, but I’d seen little description of how it works as a portfolio in any publicly available material, so I thought I’d expand on the concept to better inform readers of just how this usually works. In each of these prior articles I examined the hedging that would take place, and the following assumptions would normally be true: Retailers endeavour to hedge at least by the time the customer load has been contracted i.e. the fixed price to the customer is predicated upon a known contract price and a valuation of risk and other costs, so it is imperative to “lock in” a known hedging contract as soon as possible Retailers normally use swap contracts (or their futures equivalent) to hedge customers and may use cap contracts at their discretion Most Generators will have usually filled their hedges close to rated capacity so that they have high levels of contracting at the point in time when their contracts are live i.e. for the 2025 contract period, most of the contracts to hedge the generator would be in place by late 2024. Generators usually sell swap contracts (or their futures equivalent) for baseload or intermediate plant, whilst peaking plant usually sell caps. Whilst these four conditions are usually true, it does not reveal the true complexity of an electricity contract portfolio for a retailer and/or generator in the NEM. More specifically, it is important to understand that individual contract portfolios are usually matched against specific customers and/or generators. These businesses will also employ other portfolios often known as “trading” portfolios which are used for the purposes of enabling the use of appropriate contracts for the “hedging portfolios”, to warehouse risk and take a financial position with the aim of turning a profit. Firstly, it is worth examining a subtle but important difference between contracts that are bilateral between two parties, and futures which are settled by an exchange. OTC vs Futures When the National Electricity Market started in 1998, all contracts were “Over-the-Counter” (OTC) which meant most derivatives were bilaterally negotiated between parties, except vesting contracts which were organised by government between state-owned generators and retailers. OTC contracts settle each week as per the NEM settlement schedule, four weeks in arrears. i.e. What this means is that the settlement does not occur until all the energy spot market periods have occurred and have been settled. As an example, a 2024 calendar year contract will not be fully settled until late January 2025 because it aligns with the spot market settlement, which is 4 weeks in arrears. Normally, counterparties first sign an ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) master agreement which sets out the main terms of all potential trades and when required specifics such as price, contract type, term and region are agreed for each individual trade. Futures by contrast, settle through the Australian Securities Exchange each business day both before the contract period commences and when it is live. What makes futures different from OTC contracts are the following: Futures are margined, i.e. buyers and sellers contribute initial financial margins when opening a trade, and when the value of contracts change Contract types are rigidly defined and cannot be modified Futures go through an exchange, so aside from some exceptions, such as pre negotiated trades, trades are anonymous If the same contract is bought and sold, the position nets to zero and the profit or loss is realised as funds in a trading account, with no further financial exposure They do not require a credit rating or assessment of counterparties that you implicitly trade with but a futures broker will need to be satisfied with your creditworthiness Futures contracts can be entered into a number of years before the contract starts or even after the commencement date of the contract Use of portfolios Most businesses will utilise a portfolio of contracts against each aggregation of load or generation in a given NEM region. The levels of aggregation can vary but our first example we can consider a business with a single generator and a few customers as illustrated in figure 1. (Noting that counterparties only trade with a single business entity, not necessarily each portfolio) Figure 1: Simple example of a business with generation and customers in a single region What is important to understand is that each of the generator and customer contracts portfolios are able to buy and sell contacts to each other and the broader wholesale market even if the external market trades with a single entity. This shows the importance of trading as this enables the business to: Buy contracts when there is not enough generation to hedge the customer portfolio Sell contracts when there is too much generation to match against customer portfolio Trade with the external market because the generation portfolio does not perfectly match the customer demand Buy/sell contracts when customer forecasts change or there are changes in planned future generator availability In this fairly simple example, we could imagine a scenario where both the generator and the customer portfolios are “fully hedged” i.e. they are contracted at a level that minimises exposure to the spot market (as explored in earlier articles). This could be done at a time well in advance of the contract period. This would mean that the generator is measured against its ability to perform to its contracts and the profitability of the customer portfolio’s will be measured against whether or not there was sufficient margin in the customer price to cover the underlying contract prices as well as the cost of market exposure when the load was above or below the hedges. This arrangement has merit in that each of the business units are effectively measured against what they have control over i.e. has the retail business appropriately added sufficient margin retail margin to be both competitive and profitable and have the people responsible for the generator maintained good availability of the generator. It generally means that the opportunity cost of entering into contracts at the best time is the responsibility of the “front office” or the wholesale contracts trading desk. One of the next concepts to consider is “mark-to-market” as it is relevant to what may happen to the contract values between when a contract is entered into and when it closes at contract expiry. Mark-to-market “Mark-to-market” is a methodology of reporting profit and loss by valuing open contract positions against the fair market value of those contracts. It is not without irony, that around the turn of the century that Enron was a strong advocate for the use of mark to market so its business could identify profits based upon the change in market value of a number of OTC contracts. This meant that the business and its employees could be rewarded (or not) on an as a yet to be realised profit (or loss) in market valuation and bonuses respectively. The challenge with this methodology is where markets are thinly traded or illiquid and/or dominated by a single entity which means that prices are difficult to determine and can be artificially manipulated to mask losses or inflate profits. In the Australian context, in 2003/4 two rogue foreign exchange traders covered up a loss of $360m at NAB through a combination of entering false trades and because they employed a mark to market methodology where the market prices for a number of derivatives were measured by the middle office using priced supplied by broking firm, ICAP, where in turn, its “independent” middle office market prices were created by data sent by NAB . Used legitimately, it is a meaningful measure of the financial performance and the use of futures for these trades, eliminates much of the opportunity for fraud as an exchange has much better transparency, regulation and values that seem too high or low present a trading opportunity rather than just an over/undervalued number on a spreadsheet. Trading for Profit “Trading for Profit” is the trading of contracts primarily for the purpose of risking capital for the goal of earning an above average return. Profits are normally realised in two ways: Positive movement in the value of a derivative such that the purchase and sale realises a profit before the contract is live. Holding a contract for the active period of the derivative earns a profit when exposed to spot prices. Often, a portfolio of trades is used to take advantage of both these ways to make a profit in aggregate. As an example of #1, could be to purchase a 10MW swap for the next calendar year at $90/MWh in January this year and then sell it for $100/MWh in November. The profit is then 8760 hours X ($100-$90)/MWh X 10MW = $876,000. Noting that in a futures trade, that the profit is realised the day the position is closed, whilst a swap contract settled weekly, 4 weeks in arrears pays (7*24 hours * $10/MWh * 10MW) $16,800 each whole week, from late January of the contract year to late January, the year after. The fact that futures are closed out at the time of the trade, with no future exposure means that additional trading positions can be entered into to make additional profits. It’s plausible that someone could trade a future and a swap to make a profit, but the cashflows are more complex and variable from week to week. In the case of #2, it may be believed that derivative prices are too high and not reflective of what the spot market, or conversely too low, so a business may sell or buy respectively, a swap contract with the expectation of making a profit. The profit realised on a flat swap is simply the difference between the contract price and the average spot price, multiplied by the contract volume (MW X hours). This type of “naked” trade is often perceived as more risky because of the high variability of spot price outcomes and hence the possibility of more significant losses if the spot market prices are not as expected. Both futures and OTC trades require contracts to be held to expiry, meaning longer periods of time to realise profits (or losses). These cases simply touch on basic examples, but a trading business will likely have a portfolio of trades with the expectation that most trades in the long run make sufficient profit to cover overheads and make a reasonable profit. The need for a “Trading” Business Most NEM participants that own more than one generator or have customers will have a trading business that manages the derivative trading with the ASX and other counterparties, as well as the electricity pool settlements each week. It’s first worth noting that AEMO recognises key roles for generator registration being: Owner : the asset owner Operator : the business responsible for the O&M and day to day plant operations Controller: the entity that interacts with AEMO for market operations, bidding and settlements Intermediary : A business that takes on novated responsibilities, often controller on behalf of third parties This means it can be beneficial for a trading business to take on the intermediary role on behalf of individual generators. This happens for the following reasons: Economies of scale for generator control centres Business can take a portfolio view, covering customers, generators and energy storage AEMO allows netting off of customer pool purchases against generator revenues meaning smaller bank guarantees and lower overheads A larger single corporate entity will likely have a better credit rating than individual generators, making it simpler to trade OTC and futures Adding a generator to a trading portfolio should not require additional administration to enter into additional trades 3 rd party asset owner such as a renewable generator does not have market facing function In practice, if you examine AEMO’s list of generators , you can see that some participants have portfolios of generators, such as AGL Hydro Partnership, or AGL Loy Yang Marketing, each of which have a portfolio of generators in addition to their main registered asset. Expanding on the concept in figure 1, we can create a hypothetical example in figure 2, showing a potential structure, where the trading company is the entity which has cashflows with AEMO as the market operator, the ASX and other trading counterparties. It essentially manages the trading book, containing trades with third parties and internal trades with each portfolio. Whilst many trades are simply a pass through (i.e. buying an external contract and writing the mirror contract internally to the relevant hedge book, there may also be instances where this is not the case, which means that the trading company is effectively taking a speculative position. Moreover, we’d expect tight limits on the hedging portfolios to best match contracts to the anticipated generation or load and any speculation about markets prices or spot price outcomes are within the trading portfolio. The key enablers of the portfolio approach are: Profit and loss of generator(s) can be measured against its ability to deliver against its contracted position. Profit and loss of retail customers can be measured against hedges in place and appropriate retail margins to make a sufficient return. The Trading portfolio is where speculative trades, managing the timing of trades or recognising when it is best to buy, or sell are made. Profit (or loss) is transparent in making appropriate decisions about value, market trends and spot price outcomes. Figure 2: Example of a Trading company to support a portfolio of generation and customer load To elaborate a little more on some potential trading decisions the business may consider the following: Purchase (sell) contracts in advance in anticipation of market prices falling (rising) to either sell back into (buy from) the market at a profit or to the customer (generator) portfolio for more competitive prices. If transacting a hedge in a region is challenging, transact in an adjacent region with the market, write an internal deal in the desired region, creating an interregional hedge, with the trading portfolio taking a speculative position on the difference in prices. Accept some basis risk by selling a swap and buying a cap contract, with the view that the swap payout is more than offset by the cap payout net of cap premia paid. Purchase or sell options for the delivery of swaps, caps or futures. Purchase a PPA from a renewable project and sell a firm financial derivative such as a swap against, pricing the PPA at an appropriate discount to a firm contract. These examples are not exhaustive but represent some of the potential trades that may be entered into in a trading portfolio. Conclusion Many NEM participants have a portfolio of generation and customer loads to manage. It is usually more effective to have a single entity to trade externally and then write internal deals with each asset or customer group, such that effective trades that align with the risk management policy are made for each hedge book. Contracting risks are made by a trading portfolio, which will have some elements of speculation allowed, depending upon the risk appetite of the overall business. Each assets’ performance is then measured against the contracts written against it, whilst the speculative or “risky” part of trading is measured against a trading portfolio where an experienced trading team is expected to make longer-term higher returns which are reflective of the market risk that they take.

Planned maintenance ii. or a Forced outage … but did not have time to check either overnight (though we did note this morning that there was no counter-alert to note the restart of the unit. 2) Then at 06:41 ( NEM time ) we saw the surprising news that the Broken Hill Solar Farm had started its morning ramp this morning. 3) Note that nothing yet from the Silverton Wind Farm (and we’d also switched off the alerting on the Broken Hill BESS as it had become quite active in recent days – albeit at low levels). So this morning we opened up the ‘Trends Engine’ chart in ez2view to take a look back over the past ~20 days as follows: Given that the battery is not running (and even perhaps if it were) my first guess was hat the reconnection to the main grid had happened overnight some time … so a little earlier than Penny Sharpe had telegraphed on Thursday morning . Reporting elsewhere (at least to this point) With the suspicion above, I began canvassing a few other places on the internet where there might have been further information… From the Energy Minister At the time of publication (~09:00 NEM time) there’s no further update on Penny Sharpe’s LinkedIn page ; … that’s proved to be one of the first places we’ve seen updates From the Energy Department On the NSW Government website at this address they are noting the following: ‘Power supply to Far West NSW was restored to the main NSW electricity system overnight. No further outages or disruptions related to this event are expected.’ … and … ‘Communities outside of Broken Hill experienced a brief outage while Essential Energy reconnected the Pinnacles Place Zone Substation to the main NSW electricity system.’ as shown… From the TransGrid TransGrid posted an update ‘Primary power supply restored to Broken Hill and NSW Far West Communities’ this morning which notes: ‘As of 8:41pm Broken Hill time (ACDT) 31 Oct, Transgrid confirmed the power line linking Broken Hill to the HV transmission network was energised.’ … so, 20:41 ACDT (i.e. local time in Broken Hill) was 20:11 NEM time – which, as noted above, was roughly when the Broken Hill diesel generator switched off. A few next steps Briefly speaking, here’s a few things still to come Silverton Wind Farm still offline As yet that is still offline … will look forward to seeing that restart. Permanent Towers to replace the Temporary Towers? The reconnection has been completed using ‘temporary towers’, which ( as Dan Lee noted here ) have been getting a bit of a work-out in recent years with eight separate transmission tower failure incidents in less than five years . The permanent tower replacements will take a number of weeks still to deliver. What happened, and why … and the inevitable finger pointing Of course, there will be reviews of what happened and why. Lessons Learnt … let’s hope that there’s some clear and objective lessons learnt (in various dimensions) that will hold us in good stead for the future.",

    "title": "Down for the count: eight separate transmission tower failure incidents in less than five years",
    "date": "30-10-2024 03:56:00 PM",
    "content": "Over the past several years, the team here at WattClarity has been trying to collate more data and provide more analysis about transmission tower failure incidents. Yes… that probably reads as a very niche, nerdy and peculiar topic to outsiders… but historical evidence shows these incidents have had huge impacts on both financial and reliability outcomes for electricity generators and consumers. Earlier in the year, I posed a list of questions to our readers about transmission development , after six towers collapsed near Geelong. These questions are worth considering again after seven transmission structures collapsed near Broken Hill , and twenty-nine in South Australia – roughly 24 hours apart – a little under two weeks ago. Eight separate incidents have led to 62 transmission towers failing in less than five years. There is a sense that these incidents have been increasing in recent years. By my count, we’ve now had 62 transmission structures fail in eight separate incidents since January 2020. I’ve counted the latest events as separate incidents (for our purposes as electricity market watchers) as they occurred in different regions and had different network impacts. Some theories help explain why the occurrence of these incidents appears to be increasing. To broadly summarise the previous analysis and commentary, there are two factors at play: The age of the transmission structures. Outdated design standards. Dr John Holmes is a wind-loading expert (yes, they exist) who has been working in the field for more than 50 years. Earlier in the year, he wrote this article for us which explains that most of the older transmission structures in the NEM were designed in the 1950s to 1980s to handle synoptic wind events, as design methods were based on international practice from countries where those events occur more commonly. Severe Convective Winds (SCWs), a.k.a downbursts, pose a problem for under-designed transmission towers as they can generate a significantly higher wind load. The image below shows a diagnostic map of Australia with SCW risk. Corrosion and cyclical fatigue. Secondary to the point above, older towers may be subject to higher levels of corrosion and/or cyclical fatigue over their lifetimes – but each transmission network provider will have maintenance and upgrade processes which generally consider these factors. The intensity and frequency of the weather risk. e.g. severe convective winds, bushfires, flooding, etc. Recent scientific papers have examined whether the risk of SCWs is increasing with climate change – specifically this paper by Andrew Brown and Andrew Dowdy . Statistical diagnostic for Severe Convective Winds in Australia between 1979 to 2018. Source: ESCI I attempted to compile a list of historical incidents of these transmission tower failures back in 2022. I only found nine such incidents between 2000 and 2020 when compiling that list. I will endeavour to update it at some point down the road – but in the meantime, if you spot any missing historical incidents there then I invite you to leave a comment below or contact me directly.",

    "content": "A short article to flag a couple rapid (and noticeable) fluctuations in Mainland Frequency that we spotted this afternoon/evening on Tuesday 29th October 2024. Event #2 (bottoming at 18:00:29.8) Here’s one we spotted on the web-based frequency reading: The chart (and the readings) work in UTC, so in the comments we’ve adjusted for ‘ NEM time ’. Note that the rapid dip-and-recovery: 1) Included a depth of 49.888Hz at 18:00:29.8 according to the measurements on our high-speed frequency device. 2) Incorporating a drop of 0.062Hz in just under 4 seconds. We can see this in more detail via this zoomed-in trend (focused just on within the 18:05 dispatch interval ) with data extracted from the frequency monitor: Because this dip-and-recovery took only a few seconds down-and-back, we did not expect to see anything occurring on a dispatch interval timeframe … Perhaps something might be more visible with the 4-second SCADA data from AEMO, when that’s available? If time permits, one of the team might have a look Event #1 (bottoming at 17:31:28.1) In exploring the data extract, we also spotted another event about a half hour earlier, as shown here: In this case, there are more gyrations seen on the timestep of fractions of a second: 1) The low-point was 49.883Hz at 17:31:28.1 according to the measurements on our high-speed frequency device. 2) There were some gyrations on the way down, which makes it difficult to measure rate of decline – but there was a clear jump of 0.054Hz immediately after the nadir in only 0.1 seconds . We’ll leave this here as food for thought … one of the team might have more time to number crunch in the coming weeks (no promises!).",

    "date": "28-10-2024 08:45:00 PM",
    "content": "We noted this morning that ‘Broken Hill BESS discharges into the Sunday evening peak (27th October 2024)’ . Curiosity, and external questions, prompted me to have a longer-range look at operations – via the ‘Trends Engine’ in ez2view – this afternoon as follows: With respect to the above, the following are some key dates: Date Details 4th September 2021 According to this project page at ARENA , this date was the project start date for the AGL Broken Hill Grid Forming Battery. 25th March 2022 ARENA published this news update ‘Testing grid forming capabilities with AGL’s Broken Hill Battery’ which noted: ‘On behalf of the Australian Government, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has today announced $14.84 million in funding to AGL to build a 50 MW / 50 MWh lithium-ion large scale battery storage system with grid forming capabilities at Broken Hill, New South Wales.’ … and, at the bottom of this release, it notes: ‘AGL’s Broken Hill Battery is set to be completed in 2023.’ On the same day, AGL Energy published the Media Release ‘AGL and ARENA lock-in Broken Hill battery’ , which noted: ‘ AGL has today announced a final investment decision (FID) of $41 million with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) for its Broken Hill battery. The 50 megawatt (MW), 50 megawatt hour (MWh) battery will be supplied by Fluence and its consortium partner Valmec. 10th Nov 2022 AGL Energy released the Media Release ‘Breaking ground at Broken Hill for AGL’s new grid-scale battery’ on 10th November 2022, which noted: ‘The 50-megawatt (MW), 50-megawatt hour (MWh) lithium-ion battery will be operational in mid-2023, providing the Broken Hill community with greater energy stability.’ (several dates in) November 2023 The 15th November 2023 was the date on the cover of this ‘Lessons Learnt Report #1 (Revision 2)’ … though I note that the date at the footer of the document itself says October 2023 (so perhaps that was for revision 1?) : In the trend chart above, we can see that the 27th November 2023 is the date at which the battery was first registered in the AEMO’s EMMS (though still to provide any output). It isn’t until 3rd December 2023 that we start to see initial slivers of output . 15th March 2024 On 15th March 2024, Dan Lee wrote ‘Need for speed: How long has each battery project in the NEM taken to deliver?’ … and, in this article: 1) classified operations at the time for the Broken Hill BESS as ‘partial’. … at that point, we can see in the chart above regular bursts of charge and discharge at about half of the 50MW Maximum Capacity. 2) noted the delivery had taken over 2 years since a Financial Close of March 2022 … with the project first announced in December 2021. mid May 2024 We can see, in the chart above, that it’s not till the middle of May 2024 that charge and discharge approaches 100% of Maximum Capacity . early July 2024 The main phase of the IESS rule change process commenced on 3rd June 2024, but it was not until later that the Broken Hill BESS transitioned: 1) From the pair of units BHBL1 and BHBG1; 2) To the bi-directional unit BHB1. The date at which the new DUID was registered was 3rd July 2024, but it did not cut over until 17th July 2024. Towers Down … from 16th October 2024 It was overnight Wednesday 16th October 2024 that we saw ‘Seven transmission towers collapse near Broken Hill overnight’ . Following from that, we have collated a number of articles about the situation here on WattClarity . — Others have also been following what’s happening… 1) In particular, it’s worth noting these three (now 4) articles from RenewEconomy : (a) on Friday 25th October ‘Broken Hill has a wind farm, a solar farm and a big battery. So, why are the lights out?’ . (b) on Saturday 26th October ‘Agreement finally reached to switch on Broken Hill battery, nearly 10 days after storm blows down power lines’ ; and (c) On Sunday 27th October, ‘Broken Hill battery charges up to create local micro-grid, but why was it disabled in the first place’ . (d) belatedly adding in the article from Monday 28th October about ‘Energy regulator joins probe into reasons for lengthy blackouts in storm-hit Broken Hill’ . 2) But, of course, there are others who are also following and reporting. Operating in an island … from 26th October 2024 After ~10 days of no operations, we noted: 1) Firstly ‘Broken Hill BESS restarts operations (cautiously), on Saturday 26th October 2024’ 2) And then this morning ‘Broken Hill BESS discharges into the Sunday evening peak (27th October 2024)’ As time permits, we’ll keep an eye on what’s happening around Broken Hill (including with respect to the battery) …",

    "title": "NEM Volatility: A Curse or a Blessing for Grid Battery Storage?",
    "date": "28-10-2024 01:48:00 PM",
    "content": "Editor’s Note – This is the text of a speech presented by Pan Galanais at All-Energy in Melbourne on Thursday 2 4th October 2024. Pan’s talk was the first of 4 presentations that Paul noted in his article ‘‘Operating in the NEM’ … from All Energy 2024’ . The NEM is often recognized as the world’s most volatile electricity market. According to an analysis by Rystad Energy of 39 global electricity markets, the NEM leads in daily price fluctuations. Two primary factors drive this extreme volatility: the NEM’s unique market design and the characteristics of its energy system. First, let’s look at market design: The NEM operates as an energy-only market, which means participants are compensated only for the energy they dispatch—not for their capacity. Additionally, there are 10 Frequency Control Ancillary Service (FCAS) markets that operate in real-time, settling every five minutes. This rapid cadence demands a high level of responsiveness from market participants. The NEM’s price caps, ranging from -$1000/MWh to $17,500/MWh, add to the unpredictability. These swings occur every five minutes, creating a truly unique environment. Second, the characteristics of the NEM system amplify this volatility: Low-cost solar floods the market during midday, pushing prices down, while high-cost thermal and hydro plants often set prices in the evening. The transmission network is long, thin, and built for a different era, making it vulnerable and often limiting power flow from remote renewable generators. With aging coal-fired plants and the effects of climate change, the NEM is as chaotic as it is dynamic. But this chaos isn’t a problem; it’s an opportunity for those willing to embrace the complexity. Is NEM Volatility a Blessing or a Curse? The NEM’s volatility is a double-edged sword for battery storage developers and operators. On the positive side: BESS allows us to take advantage of both ends of the price spectrum. We can discharge during high-price events and charge when prices dip into negative territory. Operating in all 11 markets, BESS diversifies revenue streams and helps manage grid stability. BESS’s rapid response capability is well-suited to capture energy and FCAS volatility, especially during unexpected disruptions. AI-powered autobidding algorithms, like those we use, enable faster and smarter market participation, optimizing returns in real-time. However, volatility also presents several challenges: Revenue forecasting becomes complex when prices fluctuate every five minutes, and this uncertainty compounds over a 20-year project lifecycle. The industry still lacks a full understanding of the capabilities of emerging technologies, and this knowledge gap can hinder informed decision-making. Policy instability around the renewable transition adds additional risks, as does the saturation of FCAS markets as more BESS assets enter. The immature contract market complicates securing long-term offtake agreements, impacting revenue stability. Despite these challenges, volatility doesn’t deter us—it motivates us. It forces us to innovate, adapt, and turn market complexities into growth opportunities. The Key to Thriving in NEM’s Volatile Landscape Succeeding in a market as volatile as the NEM requires more than advanced technology; it demands vision, agility, and a commitment to innovation. Assembling Sophisticated Teams: Success in this space is driven by people as much as technology. Skilled teams are essential to navigate the intricacies of the NEM. Balancing Revenue Streams: Balancing merchant exposure with contracted revenues stabilizes cash flows in an unpredictable market, building confidence among investors and lenders. Planning Every Step: From project concept to decommissioning, planning is meticulous. Nothing is left to chance. Forming Strong Partnerships: Collaboration with key stakeholders is essential. Strong alliances make navigating market volatility smoother and ensure collective resilience. Risk Management: Identifying and hedging risks is essential. In a volatile market like the NEM, you have to anticipate change and have robust strategies to manage it. Aligning Interests with Equity and Banks and Local Communities: Securing the support of equity investors and banks and local communities by aligning goals fosters a stable foundation for long-term success. By turning volatility into value, Akaysha Energy is leading the charge in the NEM, delivering gigawatts of storage capacity in the world’s most dynamic energy market.

    "title": "Big Battery Revenues in the NEM Presentation from All-Energy 2024",
    "date": "28-10-2024 12:22:00 PM",
    "content": "Editor’s Note – This is the text of a speech presented by Alex Leemon at All-Energy in Melbourne on Thursday 2 4th October 2024. Alex’s talk was the second of 4 presentations that Paul noted in his article ‘‘Operating in the NEM’ … from All Energy 2024’ . There are three key revenue streams for large batteries operating in the NEM – spot price arbitrage, and contingency and regulation frequency control ancillary services (FCAS). It’s typical for a range of other supporting revenue streams to be present in battery projects, however I’m not going to cover these here, largely because of time and the fact that the precise details of these arrangements are typically confidential; but also because the value of these contracts are fundamentally driven by the underlying wholesale market dynamics. It’s worth noting that wholesale arbitrage and the contingency FCAS markets are also the primary revenue streams for small batteries, however regulation FCAS participation is effectively restricted to the large scheduled batteries. So what does the revenue stack of a battery look like? This chart shows the wholesale revenues normalised on a daily basis for the first half of 2024, for two batteries – Darlington Point in the upper panel, and Wallgrove in the lower. By normalising the revenues on a daily basis we can clearly see the relative contribution of each service to each battery’s revenue stack. Although both batteries are in New South Wales, and of a roughly similar size, they have very different approaches to wholesale revenues: Each battery is operated in quite different ways; for most of 2024 Wallgrove has taken advantage of the very frothy prices of the very fast raise contingency FCAS market (revenue in green), whereas Darlington Point has a much higher proportion of revenue from the regulation FCAS markets (blue). A battery’s operating priorities can change on a seasonal or day to day (or even hourly!); taking advantage of shifting market dynamics. The lower contingency FCAS markets (revenue in orange), typically, are a very small fraction of revenues; although there have been instances where the lower markets were more valuable. Absent very high FCAS pricing, generally 50% or more of a battery’s wholesale revenue (purple), comes from spot price arbitrage. Batteries can lose money on given days. There are a range of reasons for this, some more complicated than others, but it’s not guaranteed that batteries end each day in the black. When we talk about arbitrage, the important pricing characteristic is not the average price, and it’s not even necessarily volatility, which we usually define as prices above $300/MWh; it’s the intraday price spread. The one-hour spread is the difference between the sum of the 12 lowest priced 5-minute intervals, and the 12 most expensive intervals on a given day. The two-hour spread is the difference between the 24 most and 24 least expensive intervals, etc. The chart above shows the average monthly intraday spreads calculated for several different durations over the last year. The values are normalised per MW of capacity. Note that the numbers presented here are the absolute revenues available, achieved with full historical knowledge of the market. In reality of course these numbers will be difficult to achieve for a battery operating on imperfect forecasts. Looking at the chart, it’s pretty clear why the existing crop of large batteries in the NEM are almost exclusively between one and two hours in duration – the intraday spread values significantly decline as duration increases, and longer duration batteries increase in price on a MW basis, making business cases hard to justify. Battery capex is currently somewhere in the order of $1,000 per MW (marked on the chart with the dotted grey line), it’s clear that even for one and two-hour batteries the economics on wholesale revenues alone are marginal at best; other sources of revenue are needed. The low wholesale arbitrage value for longer spreads is part of the reason why the Capacity Investment Scheme is so geared towards long-duration batteries. Let’s now talk about FCAS pricing dynamics. FCAS markets are capacity markets. They are paid in $ per MW per hour for an asset to be available to respond to changes in the system frequency. The price is entirely unrelated to the risk or occurrence of contingency events. The pricing is instead driven by the supply/demand dynamics of the bidstack – which assets are available to be enabled for FCAS, and how much FCAS is estimated to be required to keep the system stable. The chart above shows the average FCAS prices across the day in 2024 Q2, aggregated by category. There’s a few important patterns: The contingency lower prices have a clear diurnality to them. When system demand is low in the middle of the day, units are less able to provide these services (by reducing output) – batteries might be offline or charging at full capacity and many thermal units are operating at minimum load. The regulation markets also show some diurnality, although to a much lower extent than the contingency lower markets. The contingency raise prices have a clear morning and evening peak, when units are busy providing energy to meet system demand peaks. Although the FCAS markets are capacity markets, it’s worth considering how participation in these markets interacts with the arbitrage mechanics. When a battery is charging or discharging, there is reduced headroom available to earn FCAS revenue. Because the spot price is typically an order of magnitude more valuable than FCAS, arbitrage will usually take precedence, and we can see this second order effect in the FCAS prices, however there’s clearly a co-optimisation opportunity between the services, particularly during periods of constrained supply Contingency events, which are typically associated with the loss of a large generator or network element, happen infrequently and last for very short periods of time, up to 10 minutes at most. So for batteries participating in the contingency FCAS markets the energy throughput required to correct the system frequency is immaterial in the grand scheme of things. On the other hand, the energy throughput in providing regulation FCAS is very much not immaterial! Units providing regulation FCAS are required to constantly charge or discharge power into the system to correct minor errors in the system frequency. The charts above show the average energy throughput, plotted as a percentage utilisation of the regulation FCAS procured over the course of the day in January 2024. The solid line is the average utilisation over the time of day and the shaded area is the maximum utilisation rate experienced in any interval throughout the month. There is a clear separation between how much energy is utilised in providing lower and raise services, and significant variation over the course of the day. This is particularly true for the raise regulation service, where there is an average throughput approaching 50% in the mid to late afternoon. And although there is no explicit value associated with the energy used in providing FCAS, any energy sent out or consumed from the grid earns or pays the spot price. Something to think about how that might affect the mechanics of intraday spreads… In fact, it’s not unreasonable to think that these dynamics might play into advanced considerations of how a battery should be optimised to maximise revenue, especially as the market becomes more contested and participants are increasingly looking for marginal gains. The last thing I’d like to talk about is the idea of high impact, low probability events, or what you might also term tail risk, or even black swan (grey swan?) events. On the 13th of February this year ( the ‘Significant Power System Event ‘ covered in many articles collated here ) the loss of major transmission lines in western Victoria, led to South Australia becoming electrically islanded, and FCAS could only be provided by units in South Australia. The Fast and Slow Lower Contingency FCAS prices reached the ceiling price of over $16,000 per MW per hour for about an hour, and the Lake Bonney BESS here made more than a year’s worth of lower contingency FCAS revenues in that hour, which we can see as the green spike. Limited interconnection, hot weather and low wind conditions on the 21st February ( noted here ) and 27th February ( noted here ) also drove high volatility in the energy prices, yielding large energy revenues in a short period of time, which are the purple spikes. It’s worth thinking about how these types of events might be factored into battery revenue expectations. By definition, these events are not forecastable, but we know that historically they occur on at least an annual basis, particularly in regions like South Australia and Queensland (which are more prone to becoming electrically islanded). The key question is whether a battery will have sufficient state of charge and operational flexibility to respond to these kinds of events. So what does this all mean? I think there’s two key takeaways for developers looking to build and operate batteries in the NEM. A need to understand what’s in the revenue forecasts – how do the forward curves treat high impact low probability events, and are there additional sensitivity analyses and backcasting required to complement the fundamentals. Should these events be factored into the forecast revenues, or should the battery revenues work on the fundamentals alone? There’s a clear trade off between different market services – participation in the FCAS markets will impact wholesale arbitrage, particularly the regulation services. Have these interactions been modelled with sufficient fidelity, or has the modelling assumed averages and high level numbers, glossing over the interactions on a 5-minute basis?

That detail aside, it was a worthwhile session that featured the following 4 speakers, and was well chaired by Dr Alison Demaria from our clients, CS Energy: Whilst I understand that collusion did not happen ahead of time, it was almost like the 4 speakers had prior agreement to drill in deeper into the topic of operating in the NEM (and particularly with respect to battery units, which seem very flavour-of-this-year): Pan Galanis from Akaysha Energy First we had Pan Galanis from our clients, Akaysha Energy who started with an overview of ‘NEM volatility: A Curse or a blessing for battery storage?’ : PS1 – on Monday 28th October 2024, Pan was able to share his presentation with readers here on WattClarity via the article ‘NEM Volatility: A Curse or a Blessing for Grid Battery Storage?’ . Alex Leemon from GridCog With that overview, Alex Leemon from GridCog followed (thanks for the coffee mug from the Trivia Night!) and reeled off loads of stats about ‘Big battery revenues in the NEM’ … the type of presentation that would feel right at home here on WattClarity : PS2 – on Monday 28th October 2024, Alex was able to share his presentation with readers here on WattClarity via the article ‘Big Battery Revenues in the NEM Presentation from All-Energy 2024’ . James Tetlow from Overwatch Energy Next up was James Tetlow from Overwatch Energy Pty Ltd who (despite the lack of Star Wars puns this year) helped the audience understand how ‘BESS market operations are different to wind and solar: what you need to know’ : PS3 – on Friday 1st November 2024, James was able to share his presentation with readers here on WattClarity via the article ‘BESS market operations: We need to talk about being scheduled’ . Philippe Orhan from Neoen Rounding out the presentations, and leading into an engaging Q&A session was Philippe Orhan from our clients Neoen. Philippe spoke about ‘Data Intensity of operating in the NEM, and implications for algorithmic bidding’ : Philippe even managed to sneak in a few snapshots from our ez2view software (like the ‘NEM Map’ widget above) to illustrate some of the underlying complexities of the dispatch process. PS4 – on Tuesday 12th November 2024, Philippe was able to share his presentation with readers here on WattClarity via the article ‘Data Intensity of operating in the NEM, and implications for algorithmic bidding’ .

    "title": "Analysis of the recent destructive supercell storm in Broken Hill",
    "date": "25-10-2024 01:56:00 PM",
    "content": "On October 16th, several powerful supercells tore across western Victoria and New South Wales, leaving a trail of damage in their wake. Among the most severe impacts were the failures of multiple transmission towers due to intense winds south of Broken Hill, which resulted in significant power outages across the region. Tracking the Supercells with Weatherwatch’s Storm Intensity Map One of the key tools we used to analyse these supercells was Weatherwatch’s new Storm Intensity Map . This map provided a clear visualisation of the storm paths, showing where the two supercells tracked south of Broken Hill and how they intersected with the high-voltage transmission powerlines. The insight offered by this tool is invaluable, particularly when assessing areas of impact and potential damage. Storm Intensity Map shows the path of two supercells in southwestern NSW on October 16, 2024. Source: Weatherwatch What stood out in this analysis was not only the path of the storms but the sheer intensity they exhibited—even at a considerable distance from the radar. Typically, radar accuracy diminishes the further away the storm is due to the curvature of the Earth, which limits the radar’s ability to scan the full structure of the storm. Additionally, the radar beam widens at longer distances, leading to a lower resolution of the storm’s intensity. Despite these limitations, the supercells south of Broken Hill displayed strong signatures of severity. An Unlikely Thermodynamic Environment Equally fascinating was the atmospheric environment in which these storms developed. While the kinematic environment (wind shear) was highly supportive of supercell formation, the thermodynamic environment (instability) was notably weak. Surface-level instability indicators were unimpressive, with Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values barely above 0 j/kg and Lifted Index readings hovering around +2. Both of these figures typically suggest a stable atmosphere, which would generally not support the formation of such powerful storms. However, the situation appeared different at the mid-levels of the atmosphere. GFS analysis sounding for SW NSW on October 16, 2024. Note the strong NE winds in the lower atmosphere, backing to the west above 1km in height. Further, there is mid-level moisture which likely initiated storm activity. Source: Weatherwatch MetCentre The sounding data pointed to a moist boundary layer between 600 and 700 mb, a favourable zone for storm development. Although there was evidence of a warming atmosphere above this layer, we suspect the readings were distorted by earlier convection. If we assume that the mid to upper atmosphere was actually 1-2°C cooler than indicated, the Lifted Index would likely approach 0, with a few hundred CAPE—still not ideal for major storm development but enough to allow for some storm activity. The Critical Role of Wind Shear The real driving force behind these long-lived supercells, however, was the wind shear. As we often say at Weatherwatch, “it’s all about the wind shear,” and this event was a textbook example. Even with minimal instability, the wind dynamics were more than capable of sustaining severe thunderstorms. At the lower levels of the atmosphere, winds within the bottom 1 km were out of the northeast at 20-30 knots, turning westward at 35-40 knots aloft. This provided excellent turning in the lower atmosphere, producing high levels of bulk shear (50-55 knots)—well beyond the threshold needed for supercell development. This kind of wind profile creates the ideal environment for storms to rotate and remain organised over long distances and periods of time.

Reports of a tornado causing the damage in Broken Hill have surfaced, though without an official damage survey, it’s difficult to say for sure whether one occurred. The storm appeared to primarily rely on mid-level instability, which suggests that a tornado would be less likely. Furthermore, the presence of dry air at lower levels supports the idea that the damaging winds were more likely caused by strong straight-line winds rather than tornadic activity. That said, until more detailed assessments are completed, we can’t entirely rule out the possibility of a tornado. 3D radar slice of the southern storm showing a Weak Echo Region (WER) on the northern side of the storm which is a sign of intensity Source: Weatherwatch MetCentre This event serves as a powerful reminder of the complexity of severe storm development. While most people focus on instability as the primary driver of thunderstorms, this analysis shows that wind shear can sometimes take centre stage.

    "content": "Back on 14th July 2021 we noted ‘Daniel Westerman’s Big Hairy Audacious Goal’ (BHAG) announced on 14th July 2021 – 100% instantaneous by 2025 NEM-wide’ , following his address at CEDA. This week could be termed ‘conference week’ with respect to the Australian Energy Transition , with both occurring in the same week: 1) On Monday 21st and Tuesday 22nd October we had the AFR’s Energy & Climate Summit 2024 in Sydney; followed on by 2) Wednesday 22nd and Thursday 23rd Oct was All Energy 2024 in Melbourne … more about All Energy later … Whilst we weren’t at the AFR Event, we did try to keep tabs on what (was visible externally) about what happened there – via media and social media, and through a few one-on-one conversations. Amongst other things, we noted that Daniel Westerman gave a keynote address that (in some ways) followed on from what was noted in July 2021. This address was noted here on twitter : … with the link provided to the text of Daniel’s address here on the AEMO website . Because we might reference it in future (and we sometimes find it difficult finding things on the AEMO website some time after it’s published), we thought it would be useful to copy the speech in its entirety here: ‘ I’d like to begin today by acknowledging the Traditional Custodians of Warrane, the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation. I pay my respects to their Elders past and present, and to the continuing strength and resilience of First Nations people and cultures. And I’d also like to acknowledge that, as an industry, energy assets and operations are located on the lands of First Nations people across Australia. It is on their Country that Australia’s energy is generated, transported and consumed. So, thank you for inviting me to speak here at AFR Energy and Climate Summit. Today I would like to take you to the not-too-distant future, perhaps just 10 years away, and what it will be like to operate Australia’s power system without coal in the energy mix. And I’ll do that in three parts . First, I’ll start with where the energy mix is today and the goal and challenges to harness high levels of renewable energy. Second, we’ll jump ahead by roughly a decade, to a time when most, if not all of Australia’s coal generation is likely to have retired, and what it will be like to operate that power system through a typical day. And, finally, a few thoughts on what’s needed to deliver Australia’s future power system that is secure, reliable and the lowest cost for consumers. So let’s jump in. Three years ago when I first spoke at this conference, I highlighted that Australia could see periods of time where enough renewable energy was available to meet 100% of demand as early as 2025. At the time, the peak renewable contribution for a dispatch interval stood at 61% of generation in the NEM. That’s climbing steadily, year on year, with the latest record peak being 74% this Spring. Western Australia’s grid has a record peak of 84% renewable energy, and South Australia is regularly over 90%. And in terms of renewable potential? Well, 2025 has come early. The National Electricity Market hit a period where renewable energy could meet over 100% of electricity demand in September this year. But at the time, renewables were actually meeting 71% of demand. You see, there can be a gap between the availability of renewable energy and what actually gets dispatched. The bulk of the difference comes from commercial factors – the decision of renewable generators to curtail their output due to unattractive prices in the market. This condition frequently exists in the middle of mild sunny days. Transmission line outages or congestion is a separate factor, relatively minor. And the third potential reason is the need to keep the main power grid stable and secure. This is also a very small factor in the grid today, and AEMO’s Engineering Roadmap seeks to eliminate technical barriers so that the market can dispatch the most economic generation mix. This is important because coal generators are retiring. The latest Integrated System Plan projects that 90% of coal-fired power could exit the market by 2035 in the most likely scenario. For those that haven’t retired, owners may decide to disconnect them from the grid for periods of time. Hours, days, or even months at a time. And, like old cars, these old power stations are likely to be less reliable despite best efforts on maintenance. The ISP shows that as coal retires, renewable energy connected with transmission and distribution, firmed with storage and backed up by gas-powered generation is the lowest cost way to supply electricity to homes and businesses as Australia transitions to a net zero economy. This is the lowest cost pathway to net zero, and it’s a major transformation of Australia’s energy system. The fact is Australia – the federation of states that we are today – has always had coal in the public grid. Because it was here in NSW, in Ultimo in 1899 that the first large-scale power station fired up. Steam powered generators, fired by coal. Just a few blocks from where we are today. And ever since, coal has been a feature of the nation’s growing electricity grid. First as state run grids, then joined up to form the National Electricity Market in 1998. But soon this coal will be gone. And Australia is not alone in this energy transition. A grid without coal is reality in Great Britain today. After 15 years of deliberate policy and planning, the last of their coal-fired power stations, Ratcliffe power station in Nottingham, produced its last megawatt-hour of electricity on September 30, just a few weeks ago. I was actually in National Grid’s control room, near London, on the day that Ratcliffe powered down and disconnected from the grid. When I spoke with operators, there was a sense of nostalgia. That it was the end of an era. But also a sense of confidence, since this was just one of many steps in the transformation of Britain’s energy system. In fact, Britain’s first day without coal was in 2017, during the time when I was responsible for operational control of the transmission system across England and Wales. Zero coal for Britain is both a significant milestone and globally symbolic. Britain was the birthplace of the industrial revolution over 150 years ago — largely powered by coal. It’s powered the nation and provided employment for millions of people over that time. My grandfather was a coal miner just 70 miles north of Ratcliffe. He spent much of his working life underground. A physically gruelling job, but one that provided an income for his family, and fuel for the constantly roaring power stations in Yorkshire. Australia’s system, too, has been built on that same operational paradigm from last century: Baseload coal power for steady consumption, and peaking generation to meet short periods of high demand. But that formula is no longer fit for modern Australia. The principle of a security constrained economic dispatch market, is that the lowest cost electricity is dispatched first. Today that lowest cost energy is renewable energy. Dependent on the weather, that renewable energy needs firming — the batteries, pumped hydro and flexible gas as the ultimate back-up — to support it when the sun and the wind across Australia are not. Australia’s operational paradigm is no longer ‘baseload-and-peaking’, but increasingly it’s a paradigm of ‘renewables-and-firming’. From AEMO’s control rooms, we are already seeing the shape of this new paradigm today, which will be in full flight in a future with less and less coal in the mix. How is it going to work you ask? Well that brings me to the second section of my remarks. While there’s no such thing as a typical day in AEMO’s control rooms, let’s fast forward around a decade to explore what a day could look like. As the sun begins to rise on the east coast, so too does output from rooftop solar panels on homes around the country, together with grid-scale solar facilities. Slowly at first, then flooding into the grid. Adding to the morning wind generation. Towards the middle of the day solar power could potentially meet or exceed all of Australia’s energy needs. This is already reality at times in South Australia, and Western Australia is getting close. Batteries are storing that energy for later – some close to that rooftop solar and some further away. And hydro facilities that can pump water uphill are storing that water for release later in the afternoon and evening. Australia is running on near-zero marginal cost, decarbonised power. But with the responsibility of keeping our power system secure and stable, our control rooms need to carefully manage these periods where self-generation means a very low demand for power from the main grid. You see, the main grid becomes increasingly unstable when very little power is drawn from it, a bit like the way riding a bike becomes increasingly wobbly the more you slow down. And just like a bike is designed to be ridden and not to stand still, it’s a similar principle for our main power grids. Because while consumers may be generating all the energy they need themselves, our main grids must remain stable and resilient to disturbances. Otherwise a small disturbance could have significant consequences. Traditionally, that stability has been provided by the big heavy generators spinning at the same frequency as the grid, acting like a pacemaker for the grid to make sure the heartbeat remained stable. Without coal generators, this stability needs to come from different sources. We’ll need to manage voltage levels on our long and stringy power system, and ensure that the voltage waveform is always stable for appliances around the country. We’ll have to maintain sufficient inertia so that frequency remains at a steady 50 hertz, and fault-current to keep the system safe. We’ll need reserves and ramping capability to meet rapid swings in both supply and demand. And we’ll need the ability to restore the system in the event of a major incident. Don’t worry, there won’t be a test on this at the end. But these are the challenges that our engineers, together with industry, are working through. Established technologies like synchronous condensers, new or repurposed thermal generators with spinning generators and flywheels can act like pacemakers at strategic locations around the network. And energy consumers will benefit from new transmission connecting and flowing the least-cost power from renewable energy zones to the cities and towns where they live and work. So when it’s cloudy in Sydney, people in Paramatta can use sunshine from Adelaide. But back to our day in the post-coal future. Between the late afternoon and as the evening arrives in the eastern seaboard, the reverse of the morning pattern will occur. Solar power will set with the sun and demand for power from the main grid will increase steeply as people arrive home from work and school, heat or cool their homes, and get on with the evening routine of meals, TV, study and other chores. To meet those energy needs, transmission will be vital to milk the last of Australia’s solar contribution, and to carry the power from wind turbines as the wind strengthens into the evening again. Batteries that were charged from the sun, now discharge into the grid for the evening peak. The Californian grid is an example where batteries are already playing a very meaningful role. In a grid roughly 1.5 times the capacity of the NEM and a similar proportion of renewable energy today, nearly 14 GW of battery storage has been installed over the past few years. When I was overlooking their control room in Sacremento a few weeks ago, their operations teams shared with me how successful these batteries are already in shifting energy from when the sun is shining to after it’s set., … … and, the challenges they have in integrating such a vast amount of highly flexible and at times unpredictable resource into their grid. AEMO’s Integrated System Plan shows that a large amount of storage is needed for our future power system. Different capacities, duration, locations and technology will be all be important. And there will be days and weeks when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow. This will increasingly be in the winter, when solar output is already low. These are times when flexible gas generation will provide the ultimate reliability backstop. It won’t run often, perhaps just 5% of the time, but at those times it will be critical for reliability. And when they’re not needed for generation, they can provide that steady heartbeat for the grid if this function is specified in design and construction. This would save consumers the cost of other infrastructure and means these generators can support the grid even when they’re not burning fuel. So we’ve cooked dinner, done our homework and, finished watching the telly, and Australia heads to bed… Overnight, the prevailing winds around the country will be turning the blades on hundreds of wind turbines clustered in the renewable energy zones and offshore. These will cater for nearly all of the overnight demand for electricity from the grid in south-eastern states. So to the third part of today’s topic, if that’s the future reality, what will ensure the power system is secure, reliable and the lowest cost for consumers? In a nutshell: investment. Urgent and sustained investment. In generation. In storage. And in our networks. To supplement market-based and regulated investments, federal and state governments have asked AEMO to help accelerate investment in energy infrastructure. In a sense this isn’t new, since AEMO as the system and market operator, is constantly striving to make Australia’s energy sector as investable as possible. But increasingly federal and state governments have asked AEMO to help implement their energy investment policies. This is consistent with the experience of system and market operators around the world. Australia’s new energy age is coming, fast. We’re on the cusp of an investment cycle in essential infrastructure — the likes of which have not been seen for decades. AEMO’s Integrated System Plan, Engineering Roadmap, and government roadmaps like the National CER Roadmap help light the road ahead, supported by the insights from AEMO’s other market and technical insights. And collaboration across industry, governments, market bodies and the community is essential. There will be headwinds, and unexpected events on this rapid and complex transition. But I am confident that by working together, Australia can realise the opportunities of this energy transition. Through collaboration, and a laser-like focus on the interests of our most fundamental stakeholders: The families and businesses that depend on secure, reliable and affordable energy. Thank you.

    "date": "19-10-2024 02:37:00 PM",
    "content": "We’ve already noted today that ‘‘Market Demand’ in South Australia falls to ‘lowest ever’ point on Saturday 19th October 2024’ … and that part of the reason has been because of customers off-supply (including the big loads at Olympic Dam ) following storms on Thursday evening 17th October 2024 . Here’s two discrete updates we’ve seen on Saturday afternoon 19th October 2024 : (A) Some Customers returned to service On the government website here for Department of Energy SA , we see ‘Far north power updates’ in particular noting: ‘Power has been restored to most homes and businesses in the affected area, other than Hawker and Leigh Creek.’ … more about this below. A couple questions/observations: (A1) What’s the status at Olympic Dam (and Roxby Downs)? With apologies to the other locations that had (or still have) customers off supply, my particular interest is in relation to Olympic Dam. That’s because it’s a sizeable slice of South Australian electricity demand that’s normally on the grid . Readers might like to refer back to the ElectraNet map I borrowed for this article on Thursday evening showing the three lines that AEMO noted initially tripped between 18:42 and 18:48 (NEM time). With that map in hand … About Olympic Dam In this Draft EIS from BHP in 2009 (relating to possible expansion of the site, it informatively notes: ‘Olympic Dam’s electricity requirements are currently met by two transmission lines: (a) A 275kV tramnsmission line from Davenport delivers approximately 140MVA of power to the site (this adequately covers meets the existing 125MW maximum demand (b) a 132kV transmission line off the national grid from Pimba, which is only used for standby capacity’ . Now, we know the proposed expansion has not (yet?) gone ahead, but I’m not aware of any major change on the site since this report was prepared, so we assume thinking of Olympic Dam as an ~100MW load is still valid. About the community of Roxby Downs In the department’s update (copied above) they note: ‘Roxby Downs Power has been restored to Roxby Downs but note that intermittent outages may still occur. Keep up to date with what’s happening around Roxby Downs on the Roxby Council’s official Facebook page . Readers should note that the ‘power has been restored’ bit refers: (a) to power connected from local diesel generators (b) … but with the area disconnected from the grid for a number more days. That’s what is noted in this update from Roxby Council on their Facebook page About Prominent Hill Let’s also not forget the Prominent Hill location (including the Prominent Hill mine, which is now also owned by BHP following the acquisition of Oz Minerals in 2023 ), which also has load that (I believe) is normally served from the NEM main grid, and so would also presumably be disconnected at this time? This update from ElectraNet on 22nd October 2020 ‘ New electricity infrastructure powering SA mines ‘ suggests that the load consumed at (what was) OZ Minerals’ Prominent Hill and Carrapateena mine sites was also ~100MW . (A2) DER, and Load Restoration? Notable also is the note about customers ‘… being asked to turn off their solar systems to ensure power can be maintained as the generators will not operate with solar in the system’ . I wonder how these concerns will change in future, as the take-up of residential batteries also continues to climb? (B) Clements Gap Wind Farm restarts Yesterday we noted that ‘Clements Gap Wind Farm still offline, on Friday morning 18th October 2024’ . At that time, we configured an alert inside of the ‘Notifications’ widget in ez2view to notify us when the CLEMGPWF unit started back up. This has triggered at 13:31 ( NEM time ) on Saturday 19th October 2024 as InitialMW for the 13:35 dispatch interval: Digging a bit deeper, we choose the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view (filtered for CLEMGPWF) to see the past two days:",

The key details from the statement are below: Thursday evening’s significant weather event has damaged the high-voltage network in the State’s north. ElectraNet is in the process of completing inspections in the region but so far it has been revealed four towers have been damaged on the Davenport to Pimba 132kV line. Significant damage has also occurred on the Davenport to Leigh Creek South 132kV line with 19 towers down. A further six 132kV Stobie poles have been damaged on the Brinkworth to Bungama line. Earlier this afternoon, I asked our readers “ How is the stockpile of temporary transmission towers around Australia looking? ” – there are now 42 permanent transmission towers/structures currently down (including 7 in Broken Hill, NSW that collapsed on Thursday morning , and the 6 that are still being replaced in Anakie, VIC after they collapsed earlier in the year ).

    "content": "Certainly not forgotten (amongst the articles about the weather related transmission issues in South Australia beginning Thursday 17th October 2024 ) was the transmission tower event about 24 hours earlier (late on Wednesday 16th October 2024) on the ‘X2’ line between Buronga and Broken Hill in western NSW. On Thursday morning 17th October, Dan Lee posted about ‘Seven transmission towers collapse near Broken Hill overnight’ . In this article we’ll explore a bit more… Grabbing page 5 from the 2024 TAPR from TransGrid , we can identify where this X2 line is located: My understanding is that this stretch is ~250km in length, so even surveying the damage might not have yet been fully possible given the remoteness and inclement weather. Utilising the ‘Trends Engine’ within ez2view I’ve charted a trend of output from various generators located in Broken Hill as follows: Coloured by fuel types, we can clearly see the change in generation mix … 1) Before the break – utilising a combination of supply from Silverton Wind Farm (by Tilt Renewables), Broken Hill Solar Farm (by Tilt Renewables), Broken Hill BESS (by AGL Energy), and imports/exports from eastern NSW 2) After the break – supply from the GB01 unit in the Broken Hill GT (noting that GB02 seems to have been deregistered at some point … no time to check, at this point). Likely that there are other smaller embedded diesel generators A few points to note and/or questions to explore: 1) Worth noting that the Broken Hill community would be operating as its own ‘ frequency island ’ at this point, disconnected from everyone else. … so Dan could add one other one to his list of transmission tower failures and frequency islands in this article from 16th December 2022 . 2) Given the frequency island, the diesel gensets (and whatever other embedded generators are running) would be providing the ‘Keeping the Lights on Services’ for the local community – with the VRE unable to run. 3) At some point (i.e. if time permits) we might investigate the nature of the constraints or instructions in place to keep Silverton WF and Broken Hill SF offline during this period. 4) It jumped out at me that both Silverton Wind Farm and the Broken Hill BESS came offline in the exact same dispatch interval when the towers came down: (a) The 23:30 dispatch interval ( NEM time ) on Wednesday 16th October 2024 (b) And that the BESS has not started discharging again since that time (empty, or for some other reason?) 5) Spare a thought for the lost revenue at Tilt Renewables in recent days: (a) With both Silverton Wind Farm and Broken Hill Solar Farm their assets (b) Along with a ~13 hour loss of production from Snowtown 1 Wind Farm in South Australia. 6) Finally, comparing the size of the outputs above (i.e. before, and after) and noting the much larger size of units in the ‘before’ case, it might help readers understand why the MLFs in the area have dropped through the floor , as Dan Lee illustrated/animated in this article back in 2022 . 7) Belatedly echoing the question from Christiaan Zuur here on LinkedIn the other day: ‘… do you know how much fuel is available to keep the broken hill diesels running? How long have they got before X2 line needs to be back online?’ That’s all for now…",

    "content": "The ABC , the Australian and the Financial Review are all reporting that BHP’s Olympic Dam – one of largest mines and electricity loads in South Australia – has lost power, after last night’s thunderstorm and strong winds damaged parts of the region’s transmission network. The state’s energy minister has reportedly said that the mine could be disconnected from the grid for up to a week. The outage is likely to cause a headache for system operators and the AEMO this weekend – where demand in the region was already forecast to go negative on Saturday and Sunday. Via LinkedIn, Josh Stabler of Energy Edge has drawn attention to changes in demand forecasts in South Australia. The latest STPASA run projects market demand going as low as -219 MW on Sunday. Demand in the region has drifted slightly negative in some isolated incidences over the past two years, particularly in Spring when temperatures are milder. The screenshot below has been taken from our Forecast Convergence widget in ez2view and shows the outlook for market demand (a.k.a total demand) in the region in the coming days.

    "date": "18-10-2024 12:23:00 PM",
    "content": "After consecutive nights of extreme winds that destroyed parts of the NEM’s transmission network, a few of us in the office are pondering about how many spare temporary transmission towers are currently available across Australia. The ‘stockpile’ will need replenishing, having taken some hits in the last eight months. These events include the following: Six transmission pylons collapsed near Anakie, VIC in February due to severe convective winds. Repair works to install new permanent towers started in August, but are not due to be completed until December . Seven transmission pylons collapsed south of Broken Hill in the early hours of Thursday this week. Transgrid have stated that they plan to restore the line within two weeks . We’re now aware that transmission was damaged in South Australia’s Far North last night – but we are waiting for further details on the extent of the damage. Roughly two decades ago, the six transmission companies for each state (QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, TAS and WA) bought a reserve of temporary transmission towers and strategically stored them around the country . During the system black event in SA in 2016, around twenty towers collapsed due to strong winds – as a result, Powerlink (QLD) and Western Power (WA) delivered their stock of temporary towers to ElectraNet (SA). With the current destructive storm system heading east , coupled with the fact that we are heading into storm/cyclone season – we wonder if any readers have any insights as to how many of these temporary towers there are lying around Australia currently? and what the lead times are on new orders? particularly given that Hurricane Helene and Milton has recently damaged large parts of the HVAC network in the US.

    "title": "A closer look at Goyder South Wind Farm on Thursday evening 17th October 2024 (not affected by the storm?)",
    "date": "18-10-2024 12:17:00 PM",
    "content": "As noted in this ‘(Initial) Replay of Thursday evening 17th October 2024 in SA’ :, there were some Wind Farms whose output appeared affected by the storm activity (and transmission disruptions) on Thursday evening 17th October 2024 . 1) the Snowtown 1 Wind Farm came sharply offline in the 18:45 dispatch interval ( NEM time ) … but we noted earlier that it’s back online this morning . 2) additionally, the Clements Gap Wind Farm came offline in the 18:50 dispatch interval. … we noted earlier that the unit remains offline this morning . 3) We also noted that the Goyder South Wind Farm dropped output to ~1MW in the 18:55 dispatch interval … so in this short article, we similarly take a quick look. Here’s the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view at the 11:55 dispatch interval on Friday 18th October 2024 looking back the past 24 hours: There’s a bit of up-and-down in the output profile in this image, with two particular periods highlighted: 1) The first period was approximately the time-range covered in the earlier review; 2) The second period (from 02:20 this morning) we’ve highlighted but won’t delve into 3) Coincidentally the unit output has just dropped to ~1MW in the 11:50 dispatch interval immediately preceding the snapshot. However the main take-away is that the unit performance is different than that for SNOWTWN1 and CLEMGPWF in that there’s no prolonged period of outage overnight. Drilling into the time period of interest yesterday evening, we see the following: In this case we see: 1) at 18:50 we see: (a) The unit is unconstrained (b) It receives a Target (80MW) and lands that target with no ‘ Dispatch Error ’. 2) at 18:55 we see: (a) Two bound constraint equations take effect on the unit: i. The ‘S>>NIL_TWPA_TPRS’ constraint equation; and ii. The ‘S>>NIL_RBTU_RBTU’ constraint equation. (b) This drives the CPD Price for the unit (-$43.95/MWh at the RRN) below the bid price for the Unit (-$42/MWh at the RRN). (c) Which means that the unit is ‘constrained off’ . (d) The unit successfully follows the target down, so no ‘ Dispatch Error ’. 3) At 19:00 we see that: (a) The ‘S>>NIL_TWPA_TPRS’ constraint equation is still bound; (b) But, with the other constraint unbinding, the CPD Price (-$34.69/MWh) rises above the Bid Price (-$42/MWh at the RRN).(c) (c) The unit gets a Target (of 84MW) but only reaches 15MW (FinalMW), meaning a significant ‘ Dispatch Error ’ (+69MW). So, unlike what we saw for SNOWTWN1 and CLEMGPWF , the drop in output was expected inside of NEMDE … albeit the underperformance at 19:00 on the way back up was unexpected.",

    "title": "So long solo solar, and hi hybrids?",
    "date": "15-10-2024 02:55:00 PM",
    "content": "Over the past seven years, standalone solar farms have faced a mounting list of challenges, leading to a natural but delayed shift in development focus towards battery co-location and the possibility of ‘hybrids’. Wind farm development is not immune to similar challenges, albeit to a different extent. In light of recent changes brought about by the Integrating Energy Storage Systems (IESS) rule changes – and in particular the introduction of the new Integrated Resource Provider (IRP) category – we’ve had a couple of readers ask us about ‘hybrids’, and whether recent changes will address current issues. In this article, I’ll summarise the challenges for standalone solar and wind over the long-term, and discuss how battery co-location and hybrids may, or may not, alleviate these issues. The challenges have been well covered in our annual GSD , our GenInsights reports , and through many case studies on our blog (see articles by Allan , Jonathan and Paul for a few examples) – here we’ll summarise these trends at the macro-level. But first, what sort of hybrids are we talking about? Some confusion still exists about what a ‘hybrid’ is, and it seems operators, developers, and others, are using the word interchangeably to cover many different types of projects. To try to make sense of the different permutations from an energy market/dispatch perspective, I’d recommend reading through the AEMO IESS documentation and beginning with this factsheet on IRP classification . For the sake of this discussion, here I will simplify all of the configurations into two broad categories: Co-location. Multiple units (e.g. a solar farm and a battery) owned by the same entity, located together physically and may contain some common infrastructure – but are bid and dispatched independently. These units are in the format of either: Units registered as separate stations. Therefore the underlying units are treated entirely separately for dispatch and conformance. Units registered under one station. The underlying units operate in a slightly more collective manner – particularly if they have elected for the new Aggregate Dispatch Conformance (ADC) option , but more on that later. A single-unit IRP. One unit with multiple technologies behind it (e.g. a battery coupled to a solar farm behind the inverter with one Dispatchable Unit ID) – in this case, operations, bidding and dispatch are coupled. To be clear, co-location has been around even before the IESS rule changes. Projects like Hornsdale Wind Farm & Hornsdale Power Reserve, Kennedy Energy Park, and Bulgana Green Power Hub serve as very different examples of co-location. Single-unit IRPs on the other hand, have only become possible with the recent introduction of this new registration category, and we are yet to see any units register in this way. The technologies behind these configurations can include a solar-wind combination (i.e. without a battery) but in this article I’ll only be referencing solar-battery and wind-battery combinations as these make up the majority of proposed projects . Five challenges for standalone solar, and wind too With that distinction in mind, let’s now walk through five key challenges facing standalone solar and wind farms in the NEM in order to frame discussion about whether co-location or single-unit IRPs address each. While this isn’t an exhaustive examination of all issues, it should summarise the major headwinds. 1) Softened spot price capture and economic curtailment Undoubtedly the largest issue facing utility-scale solar farms has been the softening of daytime prices caused by the juggernaut of rooftop PV and the minimum stable loading requirements of coal generation. In the next few charts, we will look at the long-term trend of Volume-Weighted Average Prices (VWAPs). In black is the VWAP for the region (weighted against total demand), and in grey is the VWAP aggregated for all solar units and all wind units. The wider the gap between black and grey, the wider the spread between average spot prices and the average prices dispatched for solar and wind farms. The gap between QLD’s VWAP and QLD Large Solar’s VWAP has been widening. Source: GSD Note: Only semi-scheduled units greater than 30MW maximum capacity included in solar and wind VWAP aggregation. In northern regions – like QLD shown above – there is higher production from all forms of solar including rooftop, so we see knock-on effects of the ‘ solar correlation penalty ’. With a relatively small share of wind capacity, the VWAP for wind in QLD does not diverge nearly as much. In southern regions – like SA shown below – where there is higher absolute production of wind (and almost all of it correlated to a mutual weather system ) – the difference between solar and wind VWAPs are not as distinct. Also relevant to both trends in SA, is that the region is on the southern side of constraint issues along VNI . VWAPs in SA for Large Solar and Wind. Source: GSD Note: Only semi-scheduled units greater than 30MW maximum capacity included in solar and wind VWAP aggregation Apart from looking at VWAPs, another pronounced trend is the number of MWhs being economically curtailed (or ‘offloaded’) by both solar and wind. The long-term trend is shown in the next chart, but I’ve also recently written this article about curtailment which digs slightly deeper into the where, how, and when, of this curtailment. Economic curtailment (a.k.a offloading) has been increasing for both solar and wind. Source: GSD 2) Falling Marginal Loss Factors Marginal Loss Factors (MLFs) are the NEM’s market signal to account for electrical losses – and they can have a significant impact on top-line revenue for generation owners. In our GenInsights publications, we’ve kept tabs on how MLFs are trending at a sub-regional level, but the two charts below show a simple distribution for the full solar and wind fleet year-on-year. Long-term annual distribution of Solar and Wind MLFs. Source: AEMO Note: Only units greater than 30MW maximum capacity are shown. The first chart highlights the two consecutive drops in MLFs for solar farms in 2018/19 and in 2019/20. In contrast, MLFs for wind farms have shown signs of general deterioration, albeit at a slower rate. MLFs are calculated through a load flow model and represent the volume-weighted average of projected losses to/from a connection point for the financial year ahead. For these reasons, there is both a locational element, and a time-of-operations element in their formation. 3) Rising network curtailment Network curtailment occurs when a network constraint limits a unit’s output to levels lower than what was available to generate. This type of curtailment has also been on the rise, affecting wind farms and now increasingly solar farms. The chart below shows the trend of these volumes over the past seven years. Economic curtailment (a.k.a offloading) has been increasing for both solar and wind. Source: GSD 4) Rising FCAS costs Generators pay a share of Regulation FCAS costs through the causer pays mechanism (although this scheme is due to be replaced in 2025 ), and a share of Contingency Raise Costs. Read Jonathon Dyson’s article here to understand more about these mechanisms. For our presentation to the CEC earlier in the year, Linton Corbet analysed Regulation FCAS costs for wind and solar units in 2023 – where he noted that larger solar and wind units bore greater regulation costs. 5) A subdued lending market for standalone projects These financial performance headwinds have also contributed to a reluctance from banks to finance greenfield standalone solar/wind projects. This, combined with the fact that project scale is increasing ( particularly for wind projects ), has led to lenders preferring portfolio financing to diversify credit risk. This was recently well articulated by Nick Cowling from Macquarie : “The average onshore wind farm in Australia now costs between $A3 million and $A3.5 million per megawatt to develop. That means constructing a 400-megawatt wind farm can cost upwards of $A1.2 billion, putting a strain on developers’ balance sheets and testing lender market capacity for single asset financings.” Only a very small portion of existing VRE is co-located with batteries. As of my last review of the ‘scheduled’ big battery fleet back in March , only 7 of these were co-located with/near mutually owned solar farms, 3 with wind farms and the other 10 batteries were more-or-less standalone. The next chart was created using the AEMO’s generator information spreadsheet and shows how this trend has begun to flip further down the development pipeline. The development pipeline indicates an eventual slowdown of standalone solar projects for proposed projects. Source: AEMO Generator Information The shortlist from the first generation tender of the Capacity Investment Scheme demonstrated that non-standalone projects scored higher , particularly in Merit Criteria 1 (contribution to system reliability and system benefits) which has a 40% weighting in Stage A of the scheme. So, hybrids to the rescue? Whether these challenges can be solved with ‘hybrids’ is where the distinction between co-location and single-unit IRPs begins to matter. The NEM has zonal price formulation based on unit-level bidding. The introduction of ADC helps alleviate some of the conformance burdens for semi-scheduled solar/wind if they are co-located – but units will still bid independently of each other. In that sense, the co-locating of units even as a single station will have no more of an effect on the bid stack than ‘the sum of the parts’ would. Therefore in terms of system benefit, it is hard to distinguish the value of battery co-location from the value of batteries. However, co-location may offer the asset operator some value from a risk management and diversification perspective. For example, it may provide a greater ability for the operator to unwind a network constraint – as batteries can have both positive and negative contributions within a constraint equation. However, it is also worth noting that co-located units part of an ADC group must conform individually if a constraint is applied to a singular underlying unit. This limitation can be specific to the type of constraint equation (e.g. stability constraints), as detailed in the ADC Fact Sheet . Co-locating a battery may also provide a partial physical hedge against a falling MLF or certain types of locational constraints – something that had otherwise been difficult to hedge against. As mentioned, we are yet to see any single-unit IRPs register yet. Greenfield projects that have progressed with announcements in recent months such as Gawara Baya and Quorn Park appear to have opted against the single-unit IRP model – so early indications show that the additional complexities are still a barrier at this point in time. These additional obligations and forecasting complications have been previously covered by Ellise Janetzki here on WattClarity . Key Takeaways As always in the NEM, there is no shortage of issues and no shortage of complicated rule changes aimed at addressing such issues – but I’ll finish with a couple of takeaways: The challenges for standalone solar and wind are multifaceted. The majority of projects in the committed and anticipated queue are still earmarked to be standalone – meaning that these issues may be further compounded in the near term. Hybrids ain’t hybrids. From a dispatch (as opposed to settlement) perspective, a key difference exists between (1) co-location and (2) a single-unit IRP. It may be simpler for developers to build control systems and register co-located systems, but the value of instead registering as a ‘single-unit IRP’ is not yet well understood. Until we see those enter the market, this will remain a theoretical debate.",

    "date": "12-10-2024 09:20:00 PM",
    "content": "On Thursday 10th October 2024, we published ‘What happened with System Load in VIC on Friday 27th and Saturday 28th September 2024?’ . … That article generated some interest, including with Peter Hannam, who published early this morning (Saturday 12th October 2024 ) ‘Some Australian states are discovering what happens when they have too much rooftop solar’ in the Guardian. My article proposed three questions, as follows: Q1) How does the AEMO even measure ‘System Load’? Q2) What’s the AEMO processes for managing concerns about ‘Minimum System Load’ Q3) What happened to System Load on Fri 27th and Sat 28th Sept 2024 … with the focus of the article on Q3 , but with some prior examples of (potential or actual) disconnection of distributed/rooftop* PV listed as part of exploring Q2. * noting that ‘distributed PV’ (DPV) is a slightly broader definition than ‘rooftop PV’ (albeit we don’t have time to head down that rabbit hole today). All about curtailment of rooftop PV (amongst other actions), but due to different concerns One of our readers (a better analyst than me!) has reached out to me with respect to those examples of (potential or actual) curtailment /disconnection of distributed/rooftop PV – and invested time to sort them into three separate categories . I found this useful, and believe that some of our readers will also? What’s the specifics of the concern? Examples of where this has applied? Concern #1 … DPV Contingency Events Our reader clarifies that the DPV curtailment that happen in DPV Contingency Events is not due to the Minimum System Load (MSL) requirements; as AEMO’s market notices explain it’s to do with managing contingency sizes. Normally the risk of a large block of PV tripping in SA is managed by keeping headroom on Heywood via constraints. But in circumstances like the ones listed in the RHS column, then AEMO may take action to have rooftop PV curtailed to keep the “PV contingency size” within secure limits. As an analogue, if there were a 600 MW single generating unit in SA then AEMO would certainly put constraints on its maximum output when SA was islanded, or when Heywood was a single-contingency risk. Hence there are examples of when this occurred: 1) In October 2022 when there is a Heywood outage limiting secure transfers: (a) Sunday 16th October 2022 was one such case in point. As copied into that article, the AEMO’s message was: ‘ AEMO has detected there is an elevated risk of the contingent disconnection of Distributed PV (DPV) which, together with the risk of loss of scheduled generation, exceeds secure thresholds in the South Australia region from 1030 hrs 19/10/2022 to 1400 hrs 19/10/2022. ’ 2) In November 2022 when there was the frequency islanding following failure of towers near Tailem Bend in the ‘Heywood link’. (a) On Monday 14th November , with that article noting MN103113 speaking about: ‘ AEMO has detected there is an elevated risk of the contingent disconnection of Distributed PV (DPV) with the loss of scheduled generation exceeding secure thresholds in the South Australia region from 1200 hrs to 1630 hrs 14/11/2022. The maximum forecast DPV contingency is 84 MW at 1330 hrs and the secure DPV contingency threshold is 80 MW. ’ (b) On Tuesday 15th November (c) On Wednesday 16th November (d) On Thursday 17th November (e) Not, on Friday 18th November? (f) On Saturday 19th November 3) In February 2024 , DPV total output is so high that constraints on Heywood aren’t sufficient to manage the size of a proportion of that PV tripping off (a) as Linton noted with ‘Too much rooftop PV in SA, almost, as forecast for 15th February 2024’ , with MN114740 speaking to: ‘AEMO has detected there is an elevated risk of the contingent disconnection of Distributed PV (DPV) which, together with the risk of loss of scheduled generation, exceeds secure thresholds in the South Australia region from 1230 hrs 15/02/2024 to 1400 hrs 15/02/2024.’ (Possible) Concern #2 … Distribution System Issues In some cases, disconnection of solar PV might have been an unintended by-product of challenges within the distribution system. There were instances on Saturday 16th September and Saturday 23rd September and on Sunday 1st October 2023 1) In the recent article in question , we linked back to the article of 2nd October 2023 titled ‘Has rooftop PV in South Australia recently been curtailed with these low points for demand?’ … 2) In that article we note that we … ‘… have not seen anything from AEMO (e.g. in its Market Notices or Media Releases or News Updates ) to suggest that there’s been a coordinated action since that time.’ … so it seems unlikely to be a function of either DPV (Concern #1 above) or MSL (Concern #3 below). 3) In comments on that article there was a message relayed from SAPN that they …: ‘… have conducted a series of tests on behalf of “Smarter Homes” with the primary objective of ensuring the capability to disconnect these inverters in emergency situations , thereby reducing potential risks. ’ … but that some inverters did not re-connect . So perhaps that was the general cause, in those instances? Concern #3 … ‘Minimum System Load’ concerns These alerts are concerned with ‘ Minimum System Load ’, as described in the AEMO Market Notices at the time. Our reader explained that, while aggregate DPV output certainly drives this, the issue appears to relate to the total level of system load ( grid demand ) and the issues that creates for things like voltage control, keeping sufficient synchronous units online etc. Curtailing DPV appears to be to be one of the few levers available for dealing with the low load issue operationally. 1) In December 2023 was the first case in Victoria: (a) On Sunday 31st December 2023 was the first instance 2) On 27th and 28th September 2024 was the second instance in Victoria: (a) There’s a collation of articles for Friday 27th September 2024 ; (b) There’s a collation of articles for Saturday 28th September 2024 . 3) This current weekend ( 12th and 13th October 2024 ) was the third instance in Victoria: (a) There’s a collation of articles for Saturday 12th October 2024 (i.e. today); (b) There’s a collation of articles for Sunday 13th October 2024 . I hope that this additional context is as useful to you (our reader) as it was to me. …. and thanks to the reader who invested time to send this in!",

    "title": "Drop in System Frequency on Saturday 5th October 2024 – Part 2",
    "date": "11-10-2024 01:02:00 PM",
    "content": "The drop in system frequency on Saturday 5th October 2024 was initially reviewed in Drop in System Frequency (approx 15:45 NEM time) on Saturday 5th October 2024 . A sudden frequency drop is typically caused by a loss of generation, relative to what is expected or dispatched to meet demand. At the time, the review didn’t find a single ‘smoking gun’ however it did observe some large deviations below dispatch level: 177 MW at QLD solar unit Western Downs Green Power Hub at the end of the 15:40 interval, and Two solar units in QLD (181 MW) and considered another in NSW (NEWENSF1, 38MW) at the end of the 15:45 interval, and Overall, a NEM-aggregate 606 MW deviation (of underperformance) was calculated at the end of the 15:45 interval. But questions remain: Were there other units contributing a shortfall of generation, and were other units resisting by overperformance (in addition to VBB1 as noted in the initial review )? To further understand the frequency drop we delve into the 4-second data (used for regulation FCAS contribution calculations) in this Part 2, looking at generating units (including BDUs). The sudden frequency drop The frequency drop happened in the 15:40 and 15:45 dispatch intervals, and by the start of the 15:50 interval it was on it’s way back towards 50 Hz. 5th October 2024 mainland frequency drop We’ve inspected the 4-second data unpack which units contributed, both positively and negatively. We’ve analysed the time period highlighted in the box, charted above. That is, from 15:35 to 15:50, meaning the three dispatch intervals discussed in the initial review. This analysis period aims to capture the beginning of the decline and the first interval after the nadir. Contributors to frequency decline The following chart summarised the 15 units that contributed the most towards frequency decline. We’ve derived the list by calculating the average deviation over the analysis period (the three dispatch intervals). At each timestamp a deviation was calculated as the difference between the unit’s MW reading and the reference trajectory. The reference trajectory is the straight-line interpolation between the dispatch targets of successive dispatch intervals. Time period 15:35 – 15:40 The largest contributor to the decline in frequency was Western Downs Green Power Hub (WDGPH1), QLD. Second was Murra Warra 1 Wind Farm (MUWAWF1), VIC. We can see how the deviations from this top 15 list expanded from -125MW to -500 MW by interval-end. Yet we also see a resistance in the frequency, sticking to 49.95. Time period 15:40 – 15:45 The deviations of WDGPH1 and MUWAWF1 are observed to be gradually shrinking. Yet, we know the frequency dropped further to its low-point in this interval. Expanding negative deviations are observed at WANDSF1 (solar, QLD), HD1WF1 (wind, VIC), COLUMSF1 (solar, QLD), GANGARR1 (solar, QLD). Our list totals a deviation of -475 MW at the end of the 15:45 interval. This represents 78% of the aggregate 606 MW underperformance highlighted in the initial review. In this interval MPP_2 (Millmerran) is also represented in a slice. The rebid reason soon after this interval suggests mill/feeder limitations were impacting the unit. Time period 15:44 – 15:50 This interval saw the beginning of the frequency returning towards the 50 Hz target. Aside from HAUGHT11 (solar, QLD) and MOORAWF1 (wind, VIC) most units in this list saw reducing deviations by interval-end. While the frequency was sub-optimal at 15:50 (just below 49.95) the first chart in the article shows it climbed steadily after that time, reaching 50Hz roughly 2.5 minutes later. Contributors to frequency rise (resistance to decline) It’s clear from this analysis that the Victorian Big Battery (VBB1) made the greatest positive contribution. Exporting roughly 130 MW over its energy target (of 0 MW) at 14:45. TUNGATIN (Tungatinah) is a hydro unit in Tasmania. Its impact on mainland frequency may have been indirect, being in Tasmania and separated by the DC Basslink, though I’ve not delved further. Torrens Island Battery (TIB1) appears to have positively contributed (around 50MW) in the 15:45 to 15:50 period. Collectively, also, LYA and LOYYB played a strong role with units exporting approximately 90 MW above energy targets in the 15:40 to 15:45 period. Our list here captures an aggregate of almost 450 MW of over performance, slightly more than the underperformance of the units above (15:45 interval-end). Note we haven’t differentiated units enabled for provision of FCAS from units dispatched for energy-alone. In the above chart NEWENSF2 also makes an appearance. This is predominantly because of its large deviation around 15:39 to 15:42. It did also make a mention, for opposite reasons, in the initial review. Its final MW was about 38 MW lower than target at the end of the 15:45 interval suggesting it also contributed to the frequency decline. We can see NEWENSF2’s contribution to decline as negative MW differences in the above chart around 15:43 to 15:46. Provision of RAISEREG? Positive contributions to oppose the decline are expected through provision of the regulation raise service. The following chart presents the raw amount of Regulation FCAS allocated to a generating unit by the AGC. We’ve listed all units with a non-zero value for this measure over our analysis period. As there are so many units text labels are added, at 15:50 for the cumulative MW level, to aid in distinguishing units. We can see that VBB1 and TIB1, and TUNGATIN all received instructions to raise the frequency through the regulation FCAS service. Absent are NEWENSF1&2 which were not participating in Reg FCAS, supporting that their presence as contributors to frequency raise was not because of central dispatch. Loy Yang A units were not instructed to overproduce for Reg FCAS reasons. We do observe that LOYYB1 was instructed (in the 15:40 dispatch interval only). Notably, BULBES1 received raise instructions in excess of 40 MW in the 15:45 interval (it’s energy target was to consume!) but did not appear as a major contributor in our above assessment (output relative to linear energy target trajectory). This is because, in our ranking, it was ranked 16 th . Although it delivered as instructed it missed out list which was restricted to the top 15. What to make of all this? We’ve analysed a drop in mainland frequency. The drop did remain within the NOFB , narrowly. So, normal operation, shall we say. Yet it is of interest to uncover how this came about. The energy transformation is charging ahead as we introduce more renewables and storage into the grid. At the same time we are anticipating the retirements of thermal plant also happen as announced. Inspecting generator and bidirectional unit behaviour, the main contributors to the decline were found to be a mixture of VRE resources (wind and solar), in a mixture of locations (VIC and QLD predominantly). Yet, the solar units were in QLD generally and the wind units were in VIC . The main contributors to resisting and restoring the frequency were batteries , with coal units also contributing, among some hydro in Tasmania and some (apparent) coincidental positive deviations from VRE resources. So, in wondering if the Semi-Scheduled category, as it currently works, is scalable and sustainable , might we also consider keeping a closer future eye on whether adding wind and solar has upped the need for FCAS in the NEM .",

    "title": "What happened with System Load in VIC on Friday 27th and Saturday 28th September 2024?",
    "date": "10-10-2024 06:54:00 PM",
    "content": "On Monday this week ( 7th October 2024 ) we noted that ‘AEMO forecasts ‘Minimum System Load’ (at MSL1 level) for VIC on Saturday 12th and Sunday 13th October 2024’ , with reference to the coming weekend. … though note that the warning for Sunday 13th Oct was cancelled yesterday, but then reinstated earlier this afternoon . In Monday’s article we also noted that the AEMO had recently also issued warnings about ‘ Minimum System Load ’ for the Victorian region for Friday 27th and Saturday 28th Sept 2024 (i.e. two weeks ago) – hence we thought it would be worth this quick review of ( our understanding of some of ) what happened on those occasions in this article, as there might be lessons for the future… In the lead up to Fri 27th and Sat 28th Sept 2024 In the following table we point back to prior articles (from the AEMO, and from us) that pertained to both of those days. Friday 27th September 2024 Saturday 28th September 2024 With respect to Friday 27th September 2024 , the following is what was noted prior to that day: 1) At 15:14 on Wednesday 25th September, the AEMO published MN118442 with respect to ‘Minimum System Load 1 (MSL1) in the VIC Region on 27/09/2024’ . The key points were: (a) a timespan of ‘ from 1300 hrs 27/09/2024 to 1330 hrs 27/09/2024 ’ (b) a lowest point of ‘ 1879 MW at 1330 hrs ’. 2) Shortly afterwards, we documented that with the article ‘AEMO issues (its 3rd ever) ‘Minimum System Load’ alert for Victoria … for Friday 27th September 2024’ . 3) After the fact, we noted that ‘On Friday 27th September 2024, VIC ‘Market Demand’ dropped as low as 1,878MW’ . … notwithstanding the caveats about apples-to-oranges comparison noted below. 4) At 15:35 on the Friday 27th September 2024 , the AEMO published MN118442 with respect to ‘Cancellation – MLS1 – VIC Region at 1530 hrs 27/09/2024’ . With respect to Saturday 28th September 2024 , the following is what was noted prior to that day: 1) At 14:54 on Wednesday 25th September, the AEMO published MN118421 with respect to ‘Minimum System Load 1 (MSL1) in the VIC Region on 28/09/2024’ . The key points were: (a) a timespan of ‘ from 1100 hrs 28/09/2024 to 1400 hrs 28/09/2024 ’ (b) a lowest point of ‘ 1638 MW at 1400 hrs ’. 2) Shortly afterwards, we documented that with the article ‘AEMO issues the (second ever) ‘Minimum System Load’ Market Notice for Victoria on Sat 28th Sept 2024 (AFL Grand Final Day)’ . 3) Early morning Friday 27th September, using the ‘ Forecast Convergence ’ widget in ez2view , we posted ‘Low, getting lower … AEMO’s forecasts for ‘Market Demand’ on Saturday 28th September 2024’ . 4) At 10:55 on Friday 27th September the AEMO published MN118475 with respect to ‘Minimum System Load 1 (MSL1) in the VIC Region on 28/09/2024’ . The key points were: (a) a timespan of ‘ from 1030 hrs to 1430 hrs 28/09/2024 ’ (b) a lowest point of ‘ 1420 MW at 1200 hrs ’. … so wider and deeper. 5) Shortly afterwards on Friday 27th September : (a) We documented that with the article ‘AEMO updates ‘Minimum System Load’ alert for VIC on Saturday 28th Sept 2024 … trending down towards MSL2’ . (b) In that article, we again used the the ‘ Forecast Convergence ’ widget in ez2view to highlight what the AEMO was looking at, in the STPASA run of 10:00 that morning. 6) Then later in the afternoon on Friday 27th September (with a snapshot of the ‘ Forecast Convergence ’ widget in ez2view at 13:35) we noted that ‘Forecast ‘Market Demand’ for 12:00 on Saturday 28th Sept 2024 in VIC falls below MSL2 alert level’ . (a) Noting that this meant that we were (at that time) past Gate Closure #1 and so within the P30 predispatch time horizon for Saturday afternoon. (b) Hence triggering the apples-to-oranges comparison noted below. 7) At 14:30 on Saturday 28th September 2024 , the AEMO published MN118493 with respect to ‘Cancellation – MLS1 – VIC Region at 1430 hrs 28/09/2024’ . As it turned out, on Saturday 28th September saw System Load turn out to be significantly higher than earlier forecasts by the AEMO , for several reasons (which are the focus of this article). On the upside, it meant no distractions through the AFL Grand Final! During, and even after, the unfolding of these events, there has been much discussion (internally, one-on-one with clients, and in various corners of social medias) about what happened, why, and what to do about this. This article is one of the next steps in our journey in finding answers to these (and other) questions… Three questions… In particular, we’d like to emphasise the following three questions… Q1) How does the AEMO even measure ‘System Load’? What might seem, from the outside, as such a simple question is unfortunately nowhere near the case in practice . In fact, approaching two weeks later and we’re still grappling with aspects of apples-to-oranges comparison that has reared its head again in relation to this issue (such as in relation to our articles about Saturday 28th September 2024 ). 1) One more reminder of the gory details of measuring electricity demand! 2) We are working with AEMO to try to clarify the specific measures that are used in relation to their evolving ‘ Minimum System Load ’ processes: (a) we will update the ez2view software (including widgets like ‘ Forecast Convergence ’) when we know the specifics. (b) we’ll also share more here … but in a subsequent article For now, understand that: 1) We believe our use of the ‘ Forecast Convergence ’ (with the toggle called ‘Total Demand’) was correct when in the ST PASA time horizon; 2) But once within the P30 predispatch time horizon (i.e. after Gate Closure #1 the day before) the widget switched to using a data set from the P30 predispatch runs … but that was no longer the the same data set in the EMMS that the AEMO was looking at in issuing these warnings! So let’s leave this here for now, as something to revisit in subsequent articles (once we have a clearer picture ourselves). Q2) What’s the AEMO processes for managing concerns about ‘Minimum System Load’ We’ve noticed various threads of discussions on social media about this ‘ Minimum System Load ’ concern (and even been tagged into a few conversations as well). We’ll not explore in any detail in this article, but rather flag a few considerations as follows: Consideration #1 … this is a relatively new concern Whilst stakeholders across the NEM (and across electricity grids worldwide) have been familiar with the challenge of not enough available capacity (including of a certain type) for decades, the challenge of not enough grid demand (or too much available capacity, especially of a certain type) is a relatively new consideration: 1) driven firstly by the rise of what we termed ‘the schism’ back when we compiled the GRC2018 and enhanced in GenInsights21 : (a) Between the rise of ‘ Anytime/Anywhere Energy ’ (b) and the commercial challenges of retaining ‘Keeping the Lights on Services’ ; 2) But it’s been especially created by the incessant rise of the rooftop PV juggernaut . As a result of this, we’re in a situation is essentially playing catch-up* in working out what to do (within the boundaries of technical and commercial considerations … and political considerations as well). * That said, it’s interesting to note that it was back in September 2021 that we wrote how ‘With ‘Minimum Demand’ plunging across mainland regions, AEMO initiates new Market Notices relating to Rooftop PV’ . So it’s not like it’s just in the past month or two that we’ve started thinking about this. Consideration #2 … is it similar to the LOR framework? Some comments we’ve seen on social media suggest some interpretations that the framework being operated under is similar to the Low Reserve Condition framework that has existed in the NEM for ~20 years, and has been refined over time. 1) There’s even specific data sets in the EMMS related to LOR … though it’s important to remember that there have been participant calls to improve these data sets in recent years (like adding into the EMMS the AEMO data for instances of ‘Actual LORx’). 2) That’s certainly not the case with MSL at present. Over time it might evolve into something like that , but it does not seem that this is the case at present … other than some basic details like three levels of alerting: i.e. LOR1 very loosely ‘like’ MSL1 LOR2 very loosely ‘like’ MSL2 LOR3 very loosely ‘like’ MSL3 Consideration #3 … some NEM-wide consistency, in terms of AEMO approach, would be nice (but beware politics) It was firstly in South Australia (with respect to the NEM) that we first encountered these challenges: 1) During Calendar 2022 : (a) Sunday 16th October 2022 was one such case in point. (b) Through November 2022 there were instances of curtailment of rooftop PV, such as: i. On Monday 14th November ii. On Tuesday 15th November iii. On Wednesday 16th November iv. On Thursday 17th November v. Not, on Friday 18th November? vi. On Saturday 19th November … all of this happening, in large part, because of the frequency islanding following failure of towers near Tailem Bend in the ‘Heywood link’. 2) During Calendar 2023 : (a) There were instances on Saturday 16th September and Saturday 23rd September and on Sunday 1st October 2023 … the article ‘Has rooftop PV in South Australia recently been curtailed with these low points for demand?’ might be a useful reference 3) During Calendar 2024 : (a) In February 2024 we saw other instances, as Linton noted with ‘Too much rooftop PV in SA, almost, as forecast for 15th February 2024’ . More recently we’ve seen these issues appear in Victoria : 1) At the end of Calendar 2023 was (I believe) the first instance: (a) On Sunday 31st December 2023 was the first instance; 2) Now in Calendar 2024 we have seen: (a) Then 27th and 28th September, as noted above; (b) Now (potentially) the coming weekend. 3) Alas the ‘don’t you touch my rooftop PV’ genie has raised its head in Victoria (and this might be compounded by different technology deployment already in place), so my understanding is that the AEMO is having to chart a different path than what was developed for South Australia. This concern will eventually reach the other regions as well ( QLD, NSW … and perhaps even TAS, eventually ), but I’m not sure much thought has been given to what might apply in those circumstances. Consideration #4 … what’s the role of the Solar ‘Backstop Mechanism’? There’s been much discussion about this new mechanism on social media in various places … we’ll need to learn more to be able to provide any useful comments about this. Q3) What happened to System Load on Fri 27th and Sat 28th Sept 2024 So that brings us to the third question, which we’ll start to explore below…. Why was System Load higher than earlier forecasts … on both Fri 27th and Sat 28th Sept 2024? Keeping in mind the underlying challenges of apples-to-oranges comparison noted above (e.g. we are not yet 100% clear on the specific metrics the AEMO has used to assess ‘System Load’ in real time), we have trended three different demand-related metrics for both days in this chart from NEMreview v7 here: With this background in mind … Friday 27th September 2024 Saturday 28th September 2024 Below and two different snapshots of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget within ez2view when selecting the ‘Total Demand’ series (and the ST PASA time-range), to help illustrate how much (in rough times) the ‘actual’ level of System Load was higher than previous AEMO forecasts… Remember that this widget enables the user to ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to see ‘that other dimension of time’ . In this case we have chosen to show as ‘Chart’ view. With respect to Friday 27th September 2024 , we’ve time-travelled back to 17:00 on the day, looking backwards to the ‘peak rooftop PV’ times in the middle of the day. Notwithstanding the apples-to-oranges issue, we can clearly see how the final measure of ‘ Market Demand ‘ is hundreds of megawatts higher than the ‘worst’ (i.e. lowest) forecasts produced earlier by the AEMO. Click on the image to open in larger-screen view. With respect to Saturday 28th September 2024 , we’ve again time-travelled back to 17:00 on that day, looking backwards. Again (notwithstanding the apples-to-oranges issue) we see that the actual level of ‘ Market Demand ‘ is hundreds of megawatts higher than the ‘worst’ (i.e. lowest) forecasts produced earlier by the AEMO. The differences on Saturday 28th September 2024 were perhaps larger than they were for Friday 27th September 2024. Click on the image to open in larger-screen view. It’s our understanding that there were a number of responses in the system and market for this day – including: 1) We understand that one of more NSP in Victoria took action (such as switching the timing of controllable loads) to increase the size of the Underlying Demand during the times of concern. … we understand that the size of the response might have been ~120MW . 2) We also understand that there was a sizeable cohort of spot-exposed but medium-sized* PV installations that switched off in response to the (anticipated or actual) low spot prices in VIC on the Friday. (a) note * we call them ‘ Medium Solar ’ because they’re larger than the 100kW SRES cut-off that determines the ‘Small Solar’ but smaller than the 30MW registration threshold for (most) ‘Large Solar’ that AEMO has direct and real-time visibility of. (b) some of these solar installations will be controlled by clients of ours, who have automated triggers to switch them off when prices are below certain threshold (e.g. in some cases ‘ negative LGC ’) levels. (c) We have seen estimates that the size of the response might have been 30MW or 40MW in aggregate … but it’s important to note that this response is invisible (especially in real time), so these are just estimates. 3) We can also see quite low level of aggregate Wind UIGF on the day … this will have meant poor output for some smaller Non-Scheduled Wind Farms in the Victorian region (though perhaps this was also forecast in advance). 4) It’s quite likely there were other responses , as well. The extent to which these responses were triggered by AEMO’s warnings of ‘ Minimum System Load ’ (compared to how much response was spot-price triggered) one can only speculate. — The result of this was that the minimum level of ‘Operational Demand’ (shown in the NEMreview v7 chart above) was 2,029MW for the half hour ending 12:00 ( NEM time ) on this Friday. For the Saturday, we also understand that there were a number of responses in the system and market for this day – including: 1) Like on Friday, on Saturday (we understand) that one of more NSP in Victoria took action (such as switching the timing of controllable loads) to increase the size of the Underlying Demand during the times of concern. … we understand that the size of the response might have been ~120MW . 2) Like on Friday, on Saturday (we understand) that there was a sizeable cohort of spot-exposed but medium-sized* PV installations that switched off in response to the (anticipated or actual) low spot prices in VIC on the Friday. (a) See above that actual prices were lower on Saturday than they were on Friday (b) … we understand that the size of the response might have been up to ~90MW at times . 3) We can also above that the aggregate Wind UIGF on the day was much higher than on Friday … but we also understand that some Non-Scheduled Wind Farms in VIC still did not run (perhaps avoiding the low prices). 4) It’s quite likely there were other responses, as well. Again, it was the combined effect (i.e. AEMO’s warnings of ‘ Minimum System Load ’, and low prices, and other effects) that we’re speaking to here. — The result of this was that the minimum level of ‘Operational Demand’ (shown in the NEMreview v7 chart above) was 1,937MW for the half hour ending 12:00 ( NEM time ) on this Saturday. We’ll leave it here for now",

    "date": "08-10-2024 12:43:00 PM",
    "content": "Thanks to Thomas MacDonald’s noted here on LinkedIn , we’ve been made aware of this rule change request from Delta Electricity: This will be of interest to a cross-section of our readers (for a range of reasons), so worth echoing here. Perhaps also worth a clarifying note that (it’s my understanding that): 1) Delta wishes to put in place a Bank Guarantee facility that is fully backed by cash : (a) i.e. provide cash to the bank, which they secure in a term deposit and use that cash to write a Bank Guarantee for the same amount of money (b) In the rule change request, Delta notes that it is ‘profitable and solvent’ – so that should mean it has no issue in finding the cash to park in the fixed deposit at the bank (in return for the bank guarantee). (c) if my understanding is correct, then this would be the same type of thing as we have done for the bank guarantee required on our office lease, incidentally (so, one would think, a standard part of banking), 2) But even this option is not available to Delta: (a) Which would obviously be frustrating for the business; (b) So, instead, Delta is proposing that they offer the cash directly to AEMO as the Credit Support (guarantee). Thomas links to the Rule Change Proposal submitted by Delta here: The AEMC has denoted this with reference ERC0403 at this location on their website. Whilst a number of energy sector stakeholders will cheer this news (as an intended outcome of the activism that we’ve increasingly seen), it does raise questions about what happens if neither scenario unfolds? 1) If Delta is unable to find some form of Bank Guarantee in the <3 months till the end of 2024? and/or 2) If such a Rule Change (or an acceptable alternative) is not put in place before that time? Would it mean that, from 1st January 2025 both units at Vales Point would no longer be able to operate? Using ez2view and the ‘MT PASA DUID Availability’ widget we can look out the next 3 years at the expected Availability of the two Vales Point units to see that the expectation is that they’ll be available at least out to October 2027: PS1 ..

(b) remember all the gory details of sooo many definitions of ‘demand’ (c) what this means is that (we believe) this particular function on the the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget within ez2view when selecting the ‘Total Demand’ series will only be relevant to the AEMO’s own alerts for: i.

    "date": "06-10-2024 02:25:00 PM",
    "content": "Taking a look at our live dashboard of Mainland Frequency this afternoon (snapshot at 12:40 NEM time on Sunday 6th October 2024, we noticed a drop in system frequency below 49.90Hz (and almost to the bounds of the NOFB ) occurring on Saturday 5th October 2024 … roughly in the period 15:40 to 15:50 yesterday afternoon: Curiosity drove me a little further this afternoon, to see what the cause might have been. No ‘smoking gun’, in terms of a trip of a coal unit? Frequent readers here will note that we’ve pre-configured alerts in ez2view (via the ‘Notifications’ widget) to alert some of the team any time a coal unit trips offline – handily sends an email which we can file away for future reference. A quick reference to the (lack of) such alerts yesterday afternoon around that time made me more curious as to what the cause might have been (i.e. given that, it seemed, on this instance it wasn’t a coal unit). Three dispatch intervals So I time-travelled a collage of windows in ez2view back to three dispatch intervals around the time when I thought the frequency drop might have occurred: The 15:40 dispatch interval Here’s a snapshot of the 15:40 dispatch interval: Notable in this snapshot is the large drop in FinalMW at the Western Downs Green Power Hub solar unit (down 233MW … easily the largest drop in any of the DUIDs across the NEM in this dispatch interval): 1) That lights up Solar in QLD as orange (i.e. a –12.83% change in aggregate output); 2) And we also note a Dispatch Error of +177MW (i.e. under-performance) relative to Target. Seeking a bit more context, we drill into the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view for the WDGPH1 unit: Here we see that: 1) the Semi-Dispatch Cap had been triggered up until the 13:45 dispatch interval (no constraints also bound, so we deduce because of Economic Curtailment ), 2) with the unit allowed to ramp from 13:45 with prices climbing (slightly) in the QLD region through the afternoon 3) But a see-saw output profile resulting … not investigated in detail 4) For the 15:40 dispatch interval we see the Dispatch Error of +177MW shown, with the unit expected to hold relatively steady (i.e. 356MW to 301MW, following the self-forecast Availability), but instead dropping to 124MW … which was both: (a) the Dispatch Error of +177MW shown; and (b) the large change in output (-220MW) in the alert. Notable in the ez2view collage image above is the large negative Dispatch Error for VBB1 : 1) Amounting to –78MW, 2) Meaning over- performance relative to Target. 3) This may be FCAS related … have not checked. The 15:45 dispatch interval Here’s a snapshot of the next dispatch interval In this case we see that: 1) Solar in QLD is significantly down: (a) Notably COLUMSF1 (b) Notably WANDSF1 2) Solar in NSW is also significantly down: (a) Notably NEWENSF1 3) But some wind elsewhere is up Notable in the ez2view collage image above is an even larger negative Dispatch Error for VBB1 (-141MW)! The 15:50 dispatch interval Here’s the third dispatch interval: In this dispatch interval aggregate Large Solar in NSW is down. Notable, again, in the ez2view collage image above is a large negative Dispatch Error for VBB1 (-65MW)! Aggregate ‘Dispatch Error’ across all Semi-Scheduled units Curious to learn more, I used the ‘Trends Engine’ within ez2view to prepare the following trend of various data series for the current Semi-Scheduled fleet of assets. The most important series is the aggregate Dispatch Error across all Semi-Scheduled units . We see that: 1) It bounces around a fair bit through the day; 2) Over the time-range shown, the largest deviation (in either direction) was a collective under- performance of +606MW at the dispatch interval ending 15:45 on Saturday 5th October 2024 (i.e. similar in size to a large coal unit tripping … though presumably not as fast as a trip ). To what extent did this contribute to the significant drop in frequency seen at around that time in the snapshot at the top of the article? A longer series of analysis Some readers here will remember that we’ve been collating (in GenInsights21 and then into GenInsights Quarterly Updates ) a series of analysis about ‘ Aggregate Raw Off-Target ’ (which feeds from ‘Dispatch Error’) for all Semi-Scheduled units, and sharing some analysis here on this site: 1) Articles pertaining to the long-term trend of AggROT for Semi-Scheduled units are sometimes collated here . 2) There are numerous specific Case Studies as well. We wonder if the Semi-Scheduled category, as it currently works, is scalable and sustainable ?",

The forecast capacity reserve requirement is 846 MW. The minimum capacity reserve available is 438 MW . AEMO is seeking a market response. AEMO has not yet estimated the latest time it would need to intervene through an AEMO intervention event. Manager NEM Real Time Operations ——————————————————————- END OF REPORT ——————————————————————- Given that this is looking forward to the evening of Tuesday 8th October 2024 , first port of call was the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view focused on the QLD region across four different metrics out in the ST PASA time horizon: For those new to this site and this widget, it’s designed that the user can ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to ‘see that other dimension of time ’. Starting bottom left and rotating clockwise, we see: 1) Whilst forecast ‘ Market Demand ’ for Tuesday is still quite modest (i.e. ~8,000MW is approx 3,000MW below the all-time maximum), it’s also higher than forecast for other evenings this week 2) We see that Available Generation drops each evening (with the sunsetting of Large Solar capability), and that (in the top rows) there’s been some other drop in capability forecast in the most recent ST PASA runs. 3) These two factors combined to an increasingly negative ‘Surplus’ Generation (or, increased reliance on imports from NSW). 4) All this combines to a recently upgraded forecast Lack of Reserve for QLD on Tuesday evening …now at forecast LOR2 level. My next view is the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view that provides a view of the MT PASA DUID Availability data set: 1) Which is published for Scheduled units thanks to the ERM Rule Change … alas not for Semi-Scheduled units, which are invisible in this respect 2) We’ve filtered down in this view to just the coal units across the NEM. Hence we see this: Note that: 1) Remembering that it’s spring (i.e. shoulder season, or ‘outage season’) it’s no surprise to see a number of coal units on planned outage … (a) particularly Callide B1 and B2, (b) and also Gladstone unit 6, (c) and Tarong Unit 2, (d) plus others in NSW and VIC. 2) But we also see: (a) that Millmerran unit 1 is offline today unexpectedly, when we’d normally expect it to be running. (b) Gladstone unit 1 also has another unit off but (based on the turquoise colour in previous days, we guess that it’s available today if AEMO wants to direct … like it was in other recent days). The MT PASA DUID Availability data set has not been updated (by design) since 18:00 on Saturday 5th October, so we need to ST PASA to see more recent changes. There’s a ‘PASA’ widget in ez2view for this, providing access to three different ST PASA runs – in this snapshot I’ve chosen the ‘Reliability LRC’ run: When comparing the ‘Unconstrained Capacity’ data set for QLD from the 11:00 ST PASA run this morning with the one for 18:00 yesterday evening, we see that there is indeed a drop in aggregate ‘Unconstrained Capacity’ forecast for Tuesday evening 8th October 2024 (i.e. as part of a broader drop the next few days). No doubt some readers will try to guess at which unit(s) in QLD have changed their availability plans, but I won’t go there…",

I wondered how the forecasted lowest point in the ST PASA run mentioned (i.e. 1,481MW for 12:00 tomorrow, Saturday 28th September 2024) would compare to the long-run trend of monthly minimum demand ? So I opened up a previously prepared query in the ‘Trends Engine’ within ez2view and updated the following long-range view: So, briefly we note that: 1) In a historical context, the lowest point for ‘ Market Demand ’ was (by a fair margin) down at 1,456MW on 31st December 2023 : … as noted in this end-of-year summary , this was documented on that day via Part 1 and Part 2 and Part 3 and Part 4 . 2) So the forecasts mentioned above (1,481MW at 13:00) would be just 25MW above that lowest-ever* point. * yes, for the pedantic, ‘ever’ means in the history of the NEM (obviously not much electricity demand in the 1800s). 3) But it would also be 116MW above the MSL2 threshold the AEMO noted in that Market Notice , at which some actions might be triggered, perhaps?

    "content": "On Tuesday afternoon this week, 24th September 2024 we noted that ‘AEMO issues the (second ever) ‘Minimum System Load’ Market Notice for Victoria on Sat 28th Sept 2024 (AFL Grand Final Day)’ . … The challenge of ‘not enough demand’ was also noted elsewhere, and there has been various discussion about this at ‘nerd corner’ within social media that I’ve seen Since that Market Notice 118421, the AEMO also issued a notice for today (Friday 27th September 2024 ), as noted here … but there’s been no update (i.e. in Market Notices) yet about expectations for Saturday. So I thought I’d quickly power up the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view to quickly have a look: The low points forecast for later today (the pre-AFL-GF public holiday in Victoria) and tomorrow (AFL GF) are clearly visible. Leaving aside the jokes about Victorians abandoning the state ‘en masse’ without a local team to support (go Lions?!) it’s clear that a major contributor will be the gangbusters rooftop PV pummeling otherwise suppressed long-weekend springtime Underlying Demand . Let’s zoom into the forecasts for tomorrow and have a closer look: Remember that AEMO had written the following at 14:54 on Tuesday 24th September in MN118421: ‘ Minimum regional demand is forecast to be 1638 MW at 1300 hrs , ’ I did have a question about which particular measure of demand the AEMO was using for these numbers (remember the gory details ) but I did find a forecast for 1,638MW in ‘TotalDemand’ (selected in this view of ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view ) published at 14:00 on Tuesday 24th September … so presumably feeding into the Market Notice issued that same hour. We see from the image above that the more recent forecasts are lower still (i.e. 1,483MW for 13:00 and 1,481MW for 12:00) … though still not below the MSL2 threshold (of 1,365MW) the AEMO noted in that Market Notice , at which some actions might be triggered, perhaps?

I’ve not actually crunched the numbers myself, but gut feeling is that: 1) the scale and depth of (directable) battery storage in Victoria currently is such that an approach like this could only be a partial solution; 2) and one that potentially costs money as well (via payments for directions) … but perhaps an approach brought about because of political expedience (and an unwillingness to switch off rooftop PV)? Perhaps one of our more learned readers can share numbers they have crunched? Something to watch, as Spring 2024 unfolds…",

Here’s the 19:00 dispatch interval ( NEM time ) captured via NEMwatch to help provide some context: Amongst the things we can see in the snapshot are: 1) With respect to spot prices, we see: (a) In South Australia up up close to the Market Price Cap …with the first dispatch interval >$1,000/MWh being at 17:50; (b) and risen off the negative prices that we’d seen through the day in all regions 2) ‘ Market Demand ’ in the green zone across most regions … slightly higher in Tasmania (in relative terms) 3) Large (but constrained) imports from VIC into SA helping to supply demand in the absence of wind production, and with solar gone to bed; 4) Leaving the remainder to supplied by gas-fired generation, some battery discharge, and some liquid fuelled units running. In the ‘Market Notices’ window we can see a number of alerts relating to forecast LOR1 or LOR2 conditions for South Australia, which prompts me to add in this snapshot from the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view as at the 19:10 dispatch interval: Remembering that we can use this widget to ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to ‘see that other dimension of time ’, we can see that: 1) Earlier in the AEMO forecast runs, they had been forecasting LOR2 conditions for South Australia this evening; and 2) Also we see current forecasts for LOR2 for tomorrow evening (Tuesday 24th September 2024 ).

    "date": "23-09-2024 03:21:00 PM",
    "content": "As noted over the weekend, on Saturday 21st September we saw a new ‘lowest’ point for Market Demand in NSW … and that record was short-lived, being pushed lower still on Sunday 22nd September . In the NEMwatch snapshot from Saturday’s article we see negative prices everywhere … including –$801.06/MWh in the QLD Region (which reminds me of the warning some years ago about ‘crunch coming …’ … albeit that that warning was more specifically about oversupply in northern QLD)! Back on 2nd September we’d written ‘Curtailment of Solar Resource from (Semi-Scheduled) Large Solar across the NEM reaches 79.2% on Sunday 1st September 2024’ following a similarly low demand weekend period. … That article stuck a chord, being referenced in Mainstream Media and well across Social Media in particular. I wondered how the recent weekend had prepared, so I modified that piece of analysis in the ‘Trends Engine’ of ez2view to look back 28 days to see the following: From this chart we can see that the Sunday 1st September 2024 still holds the record (in this short time-span, at least) for ‘most curtailment in percentage terms’ … but close behind were: 1) Wednesday 18th September 2024, peaking at 75.2%; and 2) Sunday 23rd September 2024, peaking (also) at 75.2%. Causes of Curtailment? At this point it’s useful to remind readers of Marcelle’s note of caution … ‘Not as simple as it appears – estimating curtailment of renewable generation’ from 2020. In the chart above we focus just on Semi-Scheduled units (i.e. excluding a few smaller Non-Scheduled units) and look at the difference between Availability* and Target. * With respect to Availability, remember Linton’s note about ‘What inputs and processes determine a semi-scheduled unit’s availability?’ that outlines some of the complexities about this … and possible sources of inaccuracy. With these caveats in mind, remember that Curtailment might be for a number of reasons, but primarily two main ones: Reason 1 = Economic Curtailment i.e. when prices are lower than a generator might be prepared to pay (remembering that, following the AER Rule Change , the AEMC clarified that Semi-Scheduled units could only facilitate this via their bids). Reason 2 = Network Curtailment i.e. constraints or congestion. Analysis of, and discussion about, Curtailment? In recent times there has been some discussion about curtailment on WattClarity: 1) On 2 nd May 2023, Tristan wrote ‘Australia’s Renewable Energy Boom – The Good, The Bad and the Downright Ugly’ , drawing on the GSD2022 . 2) On 9th May 2023, Allan wrote ‘Renewable curtailment – forced and not quite so forced’ . 3) Then in 2024, with reference to the GSD2023 , Dan Lee wrote: (a) On 7th March 2024, Dan wrote ‘ Keeping Up with the Curtailment: 3.7TWh of semi-scheduled economic and network curtailment estimated in 2023′ . (b) On 2nd May 2024, Dan wrote ‘Keeping Up with the Curtailment Part 2: The what and the where’ . … amongst other articles, some of which have been categorised under ‘Curtailment of VRE’ and/or tagged with ‘curtailment’ . Glass half full, or half empty? In mainstream media I’d noticed last week that Angela Macdonald-Smith had written about how ‘Solar farm output wastage tops 99pc in South Australia’ in the AFR on Wednesday 18th September (coincidentally on a day seeing large curtailment right across the NEM). Following Angela’s article I’d also seen a range of commentary (ranging all the way up and down the Emotion-o-meter ), which I’d perhaps overly simplify by summing up as follows: 1) The glass half-full view … … the roll-out of rooftop PV is going gangbusters, and that is something to be celebrated. The roll-out of different types of storage will mean that these curtailment challenges will only be temporary. 2) The glass half-empty view … … the negative prices and high levels of curtailment during shoulder seasons are undermining the business case for rolling out any more Large Solar. 3) And, of course, there are those who Gary Larson summed up as Personality Type #4 in the epic cartoon ‘hey! I ordered a cheeseburger!’ . The Energy Transition has its share of those types …",

    "content": "Earlier this week, one of our team members wondered, via our internal Slack messaging, whether WattClarity was one of the ‘eagle-eyed energy experts’ that CS Energy was referring to in this LinkedIn update : Whilst definitely not taking staking a claim to that title (e.g. please don’t call us ‘experts’ … we’re just seeking to understand as much as we can), I thought it would be useful to share an updated snapshot this evening from the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view , which readers here will recall we commonly have focused on coal units, as a sub-set of all the Scheduled * units it can focus on. * alas not Semi-Scheduled units, because the AEMC has not seen fit to eliminate that aspect of invisibility . There’s a few things to note here: 1) We can see that the Callide C4 unit is operational currently (i.e. we can see the return to service for Tuesday 10th September following the brief outage noted in this article on Friday 6th September ); 2) But what’s particularly interested me is: (a) What seems like a longer period of only partial availability than I recall seeing before; (b) And the Unit State submitted by the Generator being ‘extended planned deratings’ . I’ve not looked at recent days of bidding this evening, but did quickly open up the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view – filtered down to just the CPP_4 unit and zoomed in to just look a few weeks into the future: Frequent readers here will remember this widget allows one to ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to ‘see that other dimension of time ’. I’ve marked on the image the time at which we’d posted ‘ Callide C4 offline again, as planned–but outage extended. Have they found something?’ two weeks ago today. That’s a useful comparison point to see a longer duration of availability expected to be at ~210MW (i.e. in the green colour scale) out for the next couple of weeks. Again, note that I’ve not had time to look into the bidding, but it’s useful for readers to reflect on the complexity of the process. As CS Energy noted above: ‘As Unit C4 and its cooling tower have been completely rebuilt, we are following a similar process for a new generating unit as part of the recommissioning process. This involves a series of performance tests where the unit is ramped up and down to ensure it meets the required performance standard, and deliberately being taken offline before safely restarting.’ Let’s hope for its safe travels…",

    "date": "20-09-2024 06:47:00 PM",
    "content": "I was speaking with someone earlier today about the large Golden Plains Wind Farm in Victoria … which is in the early stages of commissioning. There’s information about the project on this ‘About the Project’ page on their website, with the salient points being: 1) First stage is Golden Plains Wind Farm East – which itself is being represented in the EMMS via three different DUIDs; 2) Second stage is Golden Plains Wind Farm West – which will be added to the EMMS later by the AEMO (when it’s closer to commissioning). Together the project will be massive (one of a few ~1,000MW wind farm projects underway). But even just the first three units add up to a sizeable project. Following the conversation, I’d promised to share some quick snapshots – and thought it would be easiest to do this via this article. So let’s start with this snapshot from the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view , focused on the GPWFEST2 unit and looking back 3 days: Whilst the chart is looking back 3 days from the ‘now’ point of the window (i.e. real time at 18:30 on Friday 20th September 2024), we’ve focused the table on the 17:40 dispatch interval on Thursday 19th September 2024 . At that point, we see that: 1) The unit output was 11MW (both Target and FinalMW); 2) There’s constraint activity: (a) The ‘V>>SMF2_SMF1_NIL_R5’ Constraint Equation was bound; and (b) The GPWFEST2 was on the left-hand side. Drilling into the ‘Constraint Dashboard’ widget via the hyperlink we set the display up the same way (looking back 3 days, with the table focused on the 17:40 dispatch interval on Thursday 19th September 2024 ) and we see this: In this view we can see that the constraint includes all 3 DUIDs for GPWF East on the LHS … but only Unit 2 is operational. It’s bid at –$1,000/MWh (i.e. well below the CPD Price for the unit) to be dispatched. We’ll look forward to seeing this unit ramp up.",

    "title": "Delivering oscillations, whilst seeking to minimise oscillations? A Case Study (Part 1?) of Darlington Point Solar Farm on Thursday 29th August 2024",
    "date": "19-09-2024 08:55:00 AM",
    "content": "Thursday 29th August 2024 was 3 weeks ago today. … at this point, we’ve already collated a number of articles here that pertain to different market events and activities on that day … including: (a) High wind yield, and high curtailment ; (b) Negative prices delivering negative Cumulative Price Threshold in VIC (followed soon after in SA). But in this article we’re going to focus particular on just one unit (the Darlington Point Solar Farm – DUID = DARLSF1) in order to utilise a few widgets in ez2view to walk through some of the market activity on the day. (A) High level overview Let’s start with this 3-day view prepared with the ‘Trends Engine’ in ez2view : This view spans three sequential days, and shows various parameters relating to Darlington Point Solar Farm: 1) Wednesday 28th August 2024 , with the output bouncing up and down somewhat during the day 2) Thursday 29th August 2024 is a particular case in point … particularly during the time-range highlighted. 3) Friday 30th August 2024 , which shows a period (10:55 to 13:10) where the output was 0MW for just over 2 hours. If we zoom into the time-range shown, we see the following: In this chart we’ve highlighted the time range from ~10:20 to ~13:00 in which we see the actual output repeatedly bouncing up-and-down over the 2+ hour period (i.e. the FinalMW, shown sequentially as a time-series line). Note that: 1) I’ve changed the formatting of this zoomed-in view of the chart for a number of the series in here so that they are (more strictly speaking) a truer reflection of the ‘each dispatch interval is unique’ nature of the way NEMDE works for some of the data sets. 2) I have, however, retained the ‘area’ nature of the series named ‘UIGF (step 1 – from AEMO)’ in order to show that, according to the AEMO’s own Unconstrained Intermittent Generation Forecast (i.e. UIGF ), the solar resource for this Solar Farm over this period was quite consistent . 3) At this point, readers might want to refer to Linton’s earlier article ‘What inputs and processes determine a semi-scheduled unit’s availability’ as a refresher to where what I have referred to as ‘Step 1’ and ‘Step 2’ in those charts fit (amongst other things): Note that on each of these three days there were a fair number of Dispatch Intervals in which the Semi-Dispatch Cap (SDC) for DARLSF1 was set to TRUE, meaning that the DUID was required to adhere to the Semi-Scheduled requirements for ‘following’ Targets …. you might like to refer to this Glossary Page about Semi-Scheduled units , particularly with respect to obligations on them following what we’ve sometimes colloquially referred to as ‘the AER Rule Change’ taking effect on 12th April 2021. (B) Some particular dispatch intervals So with the above summary in mind, we’ll use Time-Travel in ez2view , and a couple other widgets, to look in more detail at a couple of dispatch intervals through Thursday 29th August 2024 , noting the particular period of interest above (being ~10:20 to 13:00 on the day with the output jumping around like a jack-in-the-box). (B1) Before the period of interest (on Thu 29th Aug 2024) To set the scene, let’s take a quick look at a few dispatch intervals (DIs), semi-randomly chosen prior to the particular period of interest: B1a) The 07:00 dispatch interval At the 07:00 dispatch interval (DI), we see – via the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in our ez2view software – that the Solar Farm has commenced its early (late winter) morning ramp with the sunrise: At this time, we see that: 1) Referring to Linton’s earlier article , we see that the source of the Availability of the unit is the self-forecast* used by the unit (it has been given a name ‘DARLSF’ by the supplier of the service to the Solar Farm). * for those interested in delving into the detail, there’s some more context about self-forecasting on this ‘Self-Forecasting’ page of the WattClarity Glossary . 2) This availability is 6MW 3) The unit is not constrained at this point, so: (a) It’s CPD Price is equal to the RRP for the region … noting that there’s also no Intervention at this point as well (that can be another reason why these prices might be different) (b) Hence, it receives a Target of 6MW (c) At the end of the dispatch interval, its FinalMW is 5MW (d) With rounding we see that the Dispatch Error is ~0MW. 4) We see that the unit has bid its volume (limited to that 6MW availability being set by the self-forecast) down to –$1,000/MWh at the Regional Reference Node (RRN). With this precursor in mind, let’s step further… B1b) The 08:00 dispatch interval If we step forward an hour (to the 08:00 DI), we see that the Solar Farm has become affected by two different bound constraint equations . We’ll drill into these constraints in a bit more detail shortly, but the key points to note are that: 1) The two bound constraint equations combine to drive the CPD Price price for the unit down to –$1,000/MWh: 2) The unit is still bidding all its volume down at –$1,000/MWh at the RRN. 3) We see the unit output is being ‘constrained down’ by this effect: (a) The self-forecast has determined that the rising sun would allow a UIGF of 134MW (i.e. its Availability, capping the volume in the bid) (b) But the constraints deliver a Target of only 85MW (c) Because of the bound constraint, the SDC flag is TRUE … telling the unit that it needs to pay attention to its Target. (d) At this point, we see that the actual output (i.e. FinalMW) is 85MW (e) Which means a 0MW Dispatch Error . Now, let’s talk about the two constraint equations that were bound in this dispatch interval… B1c) Looking at the ‘N_DARLSF_FLT_85’ Constraint Equation The first constraint equation in the list is the ‘N_DARLSF_FLT_85’ Constraint Equation , so we’ll click through the hyperlink in the ez2view software to the ‘Constraint Dashboard’ widget for that particular constraint: On the ‘Constraint Equation Dashboard’ sub-tab (above), we see the following: 1) In this constraint equation, there is only one DUID on the left-hand side (LHS) of the constraint. 2) So the form is 1 x Target for DARLSF1 ≤ 85MW If we flip to the ‘Standing Data’ sub-tab (below), we see the following: With respect to the above image, we see 1) This constraint equation is one of the constraint equations in the ‘V-KG_WE_RC’ Constraint Set . 2) That the constraint equation has a description (provided by the AEMO) that helps to explain its purpose: ‘Limit Darlington Pt Solar Farm upper limit to 85 MW to manage post contingent voltage oscillation ’ This description is important , with respect to both: (a) The limit of 85MW maximum output; and (b) The purpose of (or need for) this limitation. If we click through on this hyperlink, we see the Constraint Details widget for the ‘V-KG_WE_RC’ constraint set: On this image we see: 1) In the table on the right: (a) we see that there are many constraint equations that are members of this set. i. Important to note that Constraint Equations are always invoked in Constraint Sets ; and ii. Typically, Constraint Sets contain many Constraint Equations. (b) In the descriptions you can read, we can see that AEMO needs to limit output of many Semi-Scheduled units to manage risks of voltage oscillations and for other reasons. (c) Darlington Point Solar Farm is only one of those with limits (though its the only one we’re going to look at in this particular article). 2) We see that this constraint set has a description as follows: ‘Outage = Kerang to Wemen to Red Cliffs 220 kV line section, entire line section’ 3) We see that this constraint set : (a) was expected to be invoked out until 17:20 on this day (b) it was invoked for many periods in the past (i.e. in rows below). (c) and, in the top row, expected again on Friday 13th September 2024 for some daylight hours. So let’s sum up… ———- SUMMARY ————– With respect to the ‘V-KG_WE_RC’ constraint set , and the the ‘N_DARLSF_FLT_85’ constraint equation within that, we see that: 1) There’s an outage on the Kerang to Wemen to Red Cliffs 220kV line; 2) As a result of this, the AEMO needs to limit the output of many Semi-Scheduled units to protect against (potentially serious) instabilities like voltage oscillations 3) Darlington Point Solar farm is only one of these units that are limited … with the maximum output allowed determined to be 85MW . —————————————- B1d) Looking at the ‘N^^V_CTMN_1’ Constraint Equation The second constraint equation in the list is the ‘N^^V_CTMN_1’ Constraint Equation , so we’ll click through the hyperlink in the ez2view software to the ‘Constraint Dashboard’ widget for that particular constraint: On the ‘Constraint Equation Dashboard’ sub-tab (above), we see the following: 1) LHS of this constraint is much more complex, with many DUIDs listed 2) Of particular interest is that there are some units highlighted, including DARLSF1 which: (a) Have negative LHS Factors … which, with reference to the ≤ form of this constraint, means that this particular constraint equation would be trying to ‘constrain up ’ the output of these units ; (b) Yet the units highlighted (all Semi-Scheduled) are being ‘constrained down ’ to below their Availability (seen in the pink colour in their bars) i. presumably by other constraints ii. such as the ‘N_DARLSF_FLT_85’ constraint equation for DARLSF1 (and similar for the others) 3) We can see that all 5 of these units have bid down to –$1,000/MWh: (a) to try to get around this constraint; … some call this ‘disorderly bidding’ (b) but the CPD Price is down at –$1,000MW also … meaning a limitation on output. (c) in this case for DARLSF1, to only 85MW for the reasons already noted above. 4) Also visible in this window are other units with spare capacity (like the Snowy Hydro units, and Uranquinty) which are not being dispatched at all (a) This is also shown in pink (where Availability > Target) (b) But in this case we see the ‘Next MW (G)’ column shows that their volume is just priced ‘out of the money’ in the relevant region. If we flip to the ‘Plain English Translation’ sub-tab (below), we see the following: I’ve highlighted the form of the RHS used in dispatch. The important points for the reader here are that: 1) The RHS is typically not of linear form … and are often quite complex 2) It contains things that NEMDE can’t control (i.e. in terms of setting Dispatch Targets) 3) Rather reflects the state of the network at the start of the dispatch interval. If we flip to the ‘Standing Data’ sub-tab (below), we see the following: With respect to the above image, we see 1) This constraint equation is one of the constraint equations in the ‘N-CTMN_4_WG_CLOSE’ constraint set . 2) That the constraint equation has a description (provided by the AEMO) that helps to explain its purpose: ‘Out = Collector – Marulan (4) or Collector – Yass (3L) or Marulan – Yass (5), avoid voltage collapse at Southern NSW for loss of the largest Vic generating unit or Basslink ’ If we click through on this hyperlink, we see the Constraint Details widget for the ‘N-CTMN_4_WG_CLOSE’ constraint set: On this image we see: 1) In the table on the right: (a) we see that there are many constraint equations that are members of this set. i. Remember that Constraint Equations are always invoked in Constraint Sets ; and ii. Typically, Constraint Sets contain many Constraint Equations. (b) We’ve highlighted the constraint equation at the top of the list as the only constraint equation currently bound (i.e. 0MW headroom and/or non-zero Marginal Value). 2) We see that this constraint set has a description as follows: ‘Out = Collector – Marulan (4) 330kV line [Wagga-Yass 132kV parallel lines CLOSED]’ 3) We see that this constraint set : (a) was expected to be invoked out until 16:25 on this day … after starting on 14th August 2024. (b) was not invoked in any prior period (i.e. in rows below). (c) and, above that, no future outages planned (at that point in time). So let’s sum up… ———- SUMMARY ————– With respect to the ‘N-CTMN_4_WG_CLOSE’ constraint set , and the the ‘N^^V_CTMN_1’ constraint equation within that, we see that: 1) There’s an outage on the Collector to Marulan 330kV line (which TransGrid refers to as line 4); 2) As a result of this, there are many constraint equations invoked in the set … we have only looked at one of them 3) Because Darlington Point Solar farm has a negative factor on the LHS of this constraint, in its own right this constraint would be seeking to ‘constrain up’ the output of Darlington Point Solar Farm (amonst others) 4) But we know that, by virtue of the the ‘V-KG_WE_RC’ constraint set above, the output of Darlington Point —————————————- (B2) During the period of interest (on Thu 29th Aug 2024) So a key question for readers might be … if it was so important for the AEMO that the output of Darlington Point Solar Farm should be limited to a maximum of 85MW output , how come the output frequently jumped well above that for discrete dispatch intervals? That’s what we’ll explore here …. B2a) Cycle #1 (10:25 and 10:30) We noted above that the period of interest began at ~10:20 … so if we wind the clock forward on this 5-widget-window forward to 10:25 we see the following: With respect to this image we see it’s not too much different, in principle, to the snapshot shown above for 08:00. The key points to highlight are that: 1) The source of the Availability is the self-forecast 2) The self-forecast is setting the availability to be 223MW … we see the dotted red line on the bid chart showing an understandable solar resource availability profile for winter 3) As a result: (a) The SDC flag is true; (b) The CPD Price is 1 cent under –$1,000/MWh (c) Bidding is still down at –$1,000/MWh … incidentally this is still the ‘Initial Bid’ submitted at 12:03 some days earlier on 15th August (d) Unit output is capped with Target = 85MW (e) Which is matched with output 4) For interest sake, note that the ‘N^^V_CTMN_1’ constraint equation is no longer bound. So, in summary, at 10:25 it’s all well and good. But if we step to 10:30 things start to go awry : The key points to highlight are that: 1) First and foremost, the most important thing to notice is that the Actual Output of the unit has ramped up to be 221MW (i.e. FinalMW) at the end of the Dispatch Interval . (a) which is obviously well above what we know to be the AEMO’s intent to have the unit capped at 85MW ; (b) But why was that the case? We’ll see in the following… 2) In this case, the self-forecast has (for reasons unknown*) dropped the UIGF to be (only) 84MW in this dispatch interval * noting that there’s no requirement to submit anything akin to a rebid reasons via the self-forecasting process. (a) We don’t know why this was the case; i. Though, as per this warning here from some years ago , that’s not going to stop some readers speculating at possible causes and/or motives; ii. For instance (and here be speculation !) perhaps some gremlin in the works has flipped the self-forecast to be based on persistence (i.e. based on what the actual output was at 10:25). (b) But it is easer (and less contentious) to see the effect that this has … 3) With Availability only 84MW, then NEMDE says (acknowledging that the ‘N_DARLSF_FLT_85’ constraint equation will limit Target to a maximum of 85MW): (a) Effectively says ‘well, I’ll have all of that low-priced energy!’ (b) Because the Target (84MW) is less than 85MW the SDC flag changes to FALSE; (c) Which seems to unblock the dispatch system for the plant i. With the net effect that the unit ramps up to 221MW ; ii. Which is obviously: 1. Well above the 84MW which the self-forecast said was its capability; 2. And also well above the 85MW limit which the AEMO is seeking to maintain to protect the grid from the risk of voltage oscillations ! 3. A major (and unexpected) Dispatch Error of –137MW Yikes?! B2b) Cycle #2 (10:35 and 10:40) Stepping forward to 10:35 (i.e. 5 minutes forward) we see the cycle begin to repeat: We see: 1) That the self-forecast sets the UIGF, and hence the Availability, at 211MW (not far below the 221MW FinalMW from the prior interval) 2) NEMDE then uses this to: (a) Set a target at 85MW; and (b) Switch the SDC flag to TRUE; 3) As a result of which the dispatch system onsite ramps the plant down to 87MW (a small Dispatch Error of -2MW). But step forward to 10:40 and those gremlins are at work again! We see: 1) That the self-forecast sets the UIGF, and hence the Availability, at 74MW (again for unknown reasons) 2) NEMDE then uses this to: (a) Set a target at 74MW; and (b) Switch the SDC flag to FALSE; 3) As a result of which the dispatch system onsite is unblocked, and the unit output balloons to 220MW (a major Dispatch Error of -146MW). We can almost visualise the question marks occurring in various control rooms…. B2b) Cycle #3 (10:45 and 10:50) Stepping forward to 10:45 (i.e. 5 minutes forward) we see the cycle re-occur, but with a difference: We see: 1) That the self-forecast sets the UIGF, and hence the Availability, at 213MW. 2) NEMDE then uses this to: (a) Set a target at 85MW; and (b) Switch the SDC flag to TRUE; 3) As a result of which the dispatch system onsite ramps the plant down to 87MW (a small Dispatch Error of -2MW). 4) Notable here is that (for the first time today) we see a rebid received by AEMO at ~10:38 : (a) The rebid reason (i.e. ‘NSW1 5MIN PD RRP FOR 1055 ($-44.99) PUBLISHED AT 1036 IS $38.69 LOWER THAN 5MIN PD RRP PUBLISHED AT 1020 ($-6.3)’ ) suggests it’s come from some auto-bidder : i. Those with access to our major GenInsights21 report will recall how (in Appendix 22 ) we identified about a dozen different (internally or externally-developed) technology-enhanced bid submission systems in the NEM. …. note that we’re not one of them! ii. However, in this instance, the rebid reason does not really help us understand: 1. why this is the first rebid for the day; and 2. whether the timing has any relation to the emergence of the gremlins in the self-forecasting process? (b) But in the Bid Details view shown below, we see that the unit has moved volume from the –$1,000/MWh bid band at the RRN up to the –$57.01/MWh bid band at the RRN (c) But note that this this change does not take effect in the 10:55 dispatch interval (as there’s no change of volume for 10:50, for reasons that have not been explored). Keeping this in mind, we step forward to 10:50 and those same gremlins in the Self-Forecast are at work again! We see: 1) That the self-forecast sets the UIGF, and hence the Availability, at 78MW (again for unknown reasons) 2) NEMDE then uses this to: (a) Set a target at 78MW; and (b) Switch the SDC flag to FALSE; 3) As a result of which the dispatch system onsite is unblocked, and the unit output balloons to 218MW (a major Dispatch Error of -146MW). 4) Readers should note here that: (a) the rebid submitted earlier (and illustrated above) was overwritten by one the AEMO received at 10:43 … so before Gate Closure #2 and able to be taken into account for the 10:50 dispatch run (b) but this second rebid had no effect ; i. this was even though the capacity is now offered at (the higher) –$57.01/MWh, ii. because this bid band is below the CPD Price iii. and the CPD Price has risen because the ‘N_DARLSF_FLT_85’ constraint equation is unbound (c) ultimately ‘the problem’ was not in the bid or rebid, but rather the gremlin in the Self-Forecast ! We can almost visualise the heart rate rising higher, and brows furrowing, in various control rooms…. B2c) Cycle #4 to Cycle #13 (another 10) skipped We’ll skip through another 10 cycles of much the same iterations … I’ve not looked in detail but it seems that there were the same gremlins in the Self-Forecast as the ultimate ‘culprit’ to the oscillations … which we presume would have been causing consternation at the Generator and also in the AEMO control rooms? B2d) Cycle #14 (12:45 and 12:50) So we land at the 12:45 for the last cycle of the day: We see: 1) That the self-forecast sets the UIGF, and hence the Availability, at 213MW. 2) NEMDE then uses this to: (a) Set a target at 85MW; and (b) Switch the SDC flag to TRUE; 3) As a result of which the dispatch system onsite ramps the plant down to 87MW (a small Dispatch Error of -2MW). We skip forward to 12:50 and those same gremlins in the Self-Forecast are at work again! We see: 1) That the self-forecast sets the UIGF, and hence the Availability, at 78MW (again for unknown reasons) 2) NEMDE then uses this to: (a) Set a target at 78MW; and (b) Switch the SDC flag to FALSE; 3) As a result of which the dispatch system onsite is unblocked, and the unit output balloons to 218MW (a major Dispatch Error of -146MW). 4) Readers should note here that: (a) the rebid submitted earlier was overwritten by one the AEMO received at 10:43 … so before Gate Closure #2 and able to be taken into account (b) but this second rebid had no effect ; i. this was even though the capacity is now offered at (the higher) –$57.01/MWh, ii. because this bid band is below the CPD Price iii. and the CPD Price has risen because the ‘N_DARLSF_FLT_85’ constraint equation is unbound (c) ultimately ‘the problem’ was not in the bid or rebid, but rather the gremlin in the Self-Forecast ! (B3) After the period of interest (on Thu 29th Aug 2024) We skip forward to 12:55 and see – via the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in our ez2view software – how the saw-tooth output profile over the past ~2 hours has delivered 14 oscillations. We wonder if this the start of another cycle… … but notably (as highlighted on the image) we see that the source of the UIGF has switched* from the Self-Forecast (used at 12:50) to the AEMO’s ASEFS system (at 12:55) . * I’ve not invested time, at this point, to ascertain whether this was a self-suppression of the self-forecast or an AEMO suppression. Something, perhaps, for Part 2 of this Case Study? Let’s step forward another 5 minutes, to 13:00, to verify that the oscillations have ceased: We see that AEMO’s ASEFS forecast persists as the source of the Availability … as indeed it does out until the 17:10 dispatch interval, which is shown below: Whew! (B4) The next day (on Fri 30th Aug 2024) In the first trend chart above, we see that on Friday 30th August 2024 there was a period (10:55 to 13:10) where the output was 0MW for just over 2 hours. Curiosity makes me take a quick look at the 13:00 dispatch interval on the following day (i.e. 24 hours after the last snapshot above): In this case we see that: 1) With the dotted red line, we do see the Availability has been jumping up and down a bit through this day as well; 2) But the unit output has been down at 0MW consistently through the prior ~2 hours; and 3) In the case of this particular dispatch interval, it’s a different constraint equation that’s bound. Clicking through to the ‘N::N_CTMN_2’ constraint equation in the ‘Constraint Dashboard’ widget we see the following: In summary, the DARLSF1 unit has been ‘constrained off’ by virtue of the CPD Price (-$57.49/MWh at the RRN) being below it’s bid price (-$52.04/MWh at the RRN). … but note that I have not looked at any other Dispatch Intervals . (C) Summing up What appears to have happened on that day is (for reasons unknown) some gremlin has imposed itself on the self-forecasting system to deliver a (clearly erroneous) UIGF that both: 1) Significantly understated the output capability of the plant; 2) Whilst, at the time, being just low enough (i.e. below the 85MW stability limit AEMO was seeking to impose) to ‘unblock’ the SDC and allow the output to balloon way up , well beyond the level of output AEMO was seeking to maintain in its constraint equation. 3) It appears to have taken 14 cycles over a little over 2 hours to sort this problem out and bring it back under control. … as a PS to the article we can add … 4) clarifying, for those perhaps not so familiar, there’s a few differences between the oscillations that unfolded on Thursday 29th August compared with the oscillations that AEMO was seeking to prevent via the constraints on DARLSF1 and others – including: (a) The AEMO was seeking to prevent oscillations in voltage and the oscillations that occurred were with respect to output (b) The time-scale of the oscillations was potentially quite different – on a 5-minute dispatch interval basis for output, but potentially on much smaller time-steps for voltage (remembering Stephen Wilson’s explanation that the NEM works on many different timescales concurrently ).

    "date": "12-09-2024 03:18:00 PM",
    "content": "Earlier this week Origin Energy organised a tour of the Eraring Power Station for a few energy-focused journalists … as a result of which we’ve seen a number of news articles written including the following: 1) In the AFR we saw: (a) Angela Macdonald-Smith wrote ‘Origin reworks coal power stalwart for final years’ . In this article Angela wrote: ‘About two weeks ago, Origin finally received approval from the Australian Energy Market Operator to reduce the run rate at each unit to 180 MW when needed , just 25 per cent of their current maximum capacity of 750 MW.’ … with mention of ‘run rate’ it’s useful to remind readers of the difference between a megawatt (MW) and a megawatt hour (MWh). 2) In the Australian we saw: (a) Colin Packham wrote ‘How Australia’s largest coal-fired power station encapsulates the energy transition’ ; and also (b) Colin Packham also wrote ‘Australia’s largest power station, Eraring, secures approval to run at lower minimum output’ ., with this article noting: ‘Australia’s biggest coal-fired power plant has received approvals to dial down its electricity supplies to cope with surging solar and wind generation, boosting its chances of staying open until 2029 to help ease a rocky path to a renewables-dominated grid.’ … remember that, in the extension agreement from 23rd May 2024 , the commitment was to extend until at least August 2027 and possibly out till August 2029. 3) In the Guardian, we saw: (a) Peter Hannam wrote ‘Inside Eraring, the giant coal-fired power station that escaped a 2025 death sentence’ . 4) No doubt it was mentioned elsewhere, as well… Curiosity grabbed hold, so utilised the ‘Trends Engine’ in ez2view * to put together the following quick analysis. * note that there’s a simpler version of the ‘Trends Engine’ in NEMreview v7 that also allows clients to produce this analysis. Daily stats (for ER01) for the past ~2 years Here’s a trend of daily statistics for ER01 (Eraring Unit 1) since the start of January 2023 … >21 months ago now: Those with a licence to the software can open their own copy of this query here . Eagle-eyed readers will see that this unit’s been running with Targets down to 180MW on occasions since 5th December 2023 … so some months before the AEMO approvals that Angela noted in her article. Presumably this gap in time was related to testing processes. 1) Prior to that reduction, the ‘minimum generation’ level (sometimes called ‘minimum load’) was down at 210MW. 2) I’ve not looked at the other units, but presume the transition was roughly the same. 3) That 120MW reduction in Min Load levels across the 4 units will flow through to: (a) The ability to get out of the way of more rooftop PV injections … especially on days like 1st September 2024 : i. When Underlying Demand was low (due to seasonal factors); and, in conjunction ii. When ~80% of Large Solar generation potential was curtailed ; and ii. When ~54% of Wind generation potential was curtailed . (b) But also could provide additional revenue boost (depending on hedge levels) if Origin is paid on the spot (i.e. when spot prices are negative) for providing hedge cover (above its lower min load) to its counterparties. … that was one point Tim Nelson made in his talk earlier this week at the CEC’s AWIS . Monthly stats (for ER01) for the ~25 years Cranking the handle back till the start of 2000 and chunking the data up to monthly stats, we see the following trend over ~25 years of NEM history (still for the ER01 unit): In this trend we see that: 1) There were several points in the past that the unit peak capacity (either Registered Capacity or Maximum Capacity … note the difference ) has been increased; and also 2) That in the early part of the NEM it looks like there might have been some technical limitation (under certain circumstances) down at ~230MW … but I’ve not investigated further. Current outages Finally, let’s add this snapshot from the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view at the 15:00 dispatch interval today: With respect to the above: 1) Some of the articles above also talk about the (pretty major!) Planned Maintenance Outage underway at ER03 (Eraring unit 3) currently, with the return-to-service date currently out at 11th November 2024 … another 60 days away. 2) We also see a shorter notice Unplanned Maintenance Outage coming up imminently for ER04 (Eraring Unit 4) for reasons I’ve not investigated.

    "date": "09-09-2024 02:00:00 PM",
    "content": "The over-optimism of project timelines in the NEM has been a theme of my WattClarity articles over the last few months. Whether it be for Snowy 2.0 , Project Energy Connect , or a number of new wind and solar development projects that have been beset by delays . With the return of Callide C4 eventuating a week and a half ago, I’m adding another one to that list. As was well-publicised, the unit was part of a catastrophic explosion on the 25th of May 2021 . Given the nature and extent of the damage, the repair timeline was highly uncertain ( as we noted at the time ) but a tentative return-to-service (RTS) date was initially marked for June 1st 2022 via the MTPASA unit availability process. Coined by Paul as ‘ the never-ending story ‘, the unit’s return faced nine delays until it eventually came back online late last month in a partial capacity. Below I’ve charted these delays based on the MTPASA data, periodically submitted by CS Energy during the outage. Forecast convergence of Callide C4’s expected return, compared against the actual number of days that the unit was offline. Source: ez2view Generator Outages widget The chart shows the countdown of days until the expected return date (as stated at each point in time), compared against the actual return timeline of 1,193 days . Whilst the repair process (and estimating its length) would have been a very complex engineering task with many moving parts – its quite clear in hindsight at least, that expectations (even those, made part-way through the repair process) were consistently overly-optimistic. Whilst the unit was brought back online in a partial capacity on the 30th of August, it has since been taken back offline (as was planned), but that outage has since been extended . The current MTPASA data indicates the unit is slated to return to full capacity this Sunday, the 15th of September.",

    "date": "06-09-2024 05:16:00 PM",
    "content": "In part because of the drop in System Frequency at ~14:12 in conjunction with the Market Suspension , I had reason to glance at the live System Frequency trace (which we can dial back to look at up to 24 hours), and I saw a second dip in frequency as shown below: One of our team members extracted the data from around the period of the second drop, and it looks like this if we zoom in: So, in summary, we see that the frequency was dropping in bursts through the dispatch interval ending 16:45 , and then had one more burst downwards (to the lowest point at 49.856Hz at 16:45:23 ) in the early part of the dispatch interval ending 16:50 before trending back upwards in bursts. Why do Frequency Drops occur? In the WattClarity Glossary Page about ‘FCAS’ ’ we’ve included an illustration of how System Frequency is like a ‘heartbeat’ for the NEM. It normally sits close to 50Hz, and NEM Rules prescribe that it should be maintained within the NOFB (Normal Operating Frequency Band) Commonly when we see a large drop in frequency we’ll see that there was a large drop in output at a single unit or station (commonly a coal unit if it trips from full load – such as seen on Wed 14th August (with LYA4 trip) and on Mon 19th August (with TNPS1 trip)). But in this instance: 1) I could not find anything like that occurring in the 16:45 or in the 16:50 dispatch interval 2) I also looked in the immediate (time) neighbourhood and could not see any single large change. Hypothesis (Speculation!) … Was this due to some collective (and relatively rapid) drop in Large Solar? Warning … here be speculation! Readers should note that what follows is more of a very curious question than any definitive statement of proof! Maybe I’ve not looked in the right places … but the only thing that jumped out at me was a collective drop in output across many Large Solar Farms in the 5-minute periods ending 16:45 and ending 16:50 … The 16:45 dispatch interval We can see this in this snapshot from ez2view time-travelled back to the 16:45 dispatch interval on Thursday 5th September 2024 : With respect to this image note that: 1) The ‘NEM Map’ widget is lit up with some alert colours, signifying significant change (which can be up, or down) in the collective output of those Fuel Types in those regions in the 5 minute period to 16:45 (i.e. based on FinalMW SCADA readings) 2) The solar contribution in all 4 regions are coloured, collectively pointing to the 417MW drop in Large Solar output across the NEM from 16:40 to 16:45. … note that solar is declining in the afternoon, so we’d expect it to be dropping … but a change that size is significantly larger than the drops in neighbouring dispatch intervals. 3) In the table of the ‘Solar’ widget: (a) I have sorted the table in descending order of drop in output (there are a couple farms way at the bottom of the table that increased slightly). (b) I’ve draw a box around the column that adds to 417MW. 4) Also shown on the left is a list of alerts in the ‘Notifications’ widget that have triggered on ‘ Dispatch Error ’ in that dispatch interval: (a) It’s done this based on ‘Next Day Public’ data. (b) Based on AEMO’s logic, a positive number is under performance compared to target. (c) but, because its coded to work in Real Time for clients who have Private Data in Real Time: i. these alerts are triggered when alerting for the prior (i.e. 16:40) dispatch interval. ii. because that’s the one with FinalMW already published iii. though perhaps we should be switching this logic (i.e. to show the current dispatch interval) when Time-Travel is used? (d) As an aside, note that ‘ Dispatch Error ’ is one input into the ‘ Raw Off-Target ’ metric we have written about elsewhere … particularly in relation to an escalating incidence of large collective under performance across all Semi-Scheduled units. 5) To illustrate this, I’ve drilled into BNGSF1 (i.e. Bungala Solar Farm 1 happens to be top of the list) in the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view : In this case we can see that the Dispatch Error for the preceding (i.e. 16:40) dispatch interval was +48 MW, whilst the Dispatch Error for the 16:45 dispatch interval was still significant (at +32 MW) but somewhat smaller. The key point of the Dispatch Errors show is that these were unexpected by the AEMO in terms of making supply and demand balance inside of NEMDE. We can see in the window above that there were several Solar Farms with large unexpected underperformance in the five minutes ending 16:40 … so what about 16:45? The 16:50 dispatch interval Here’s that ez2view window stepped forward again to the 16:50 dispatch interval on Thursday 5th September 2024 : I’ve highlighted two things in this window: 1) On the right, we see the collective drop in output from Large Solar was 345MW : (a) So not as large as in the 5 minutes to 16:45, but perhaps compounding on the decline in frequency seen already underway? (b) But to what extent was this drop unexpected? 2) On the left we see a few alerts for ‘ Dispatch Error ’ … but remember again these are for the prior Dispatch Interval (so now the five minute period to 16:45) The 16:55 dispatch interval Here’s that ez2view window stepped forward again to the 16:55 dispatch interval on Thursday 5th September 2024 : Note here that some of the Dispatch Errors for Large Solar Farms (which really pertain to the 5 minute period ending 16:50) are unexpected increases in output compared to Target . … including for BNGSF1 and BNGSF2. So, in summary, contributions from Large Solar dropped by large (collective) amounts through these dispatch intervals … but the extent to which the increases were larger (or smaller) than expected is not clear from the above. So using the ‘Trends Engine’ within ez2view I created the following chart: We can clearly see Aggregate ‘ Dispatch Error ’ jumping all over the place through Thursday 5th September 2024 (presumably as cloud cover took its toll). Of particular interest were the aggregate results for the five minute periods: 1) Ending 16:40 (‘ Dispatch Error ’ = +201MW, so collective under performance, as frequency drops) 2) Ending 16:45 (‘ Dispatch Error ’ = +191MW, so collective under performance, as frequency drops) 3) Ending 16:50 (‘ Dispatch Error ’ = -16MW, so collective over performance, as frequency starts to climb again after the lowest point at 16:45:32 at the start of the dispatch interval) Perhaps underperformance of solar (compared to expectations) did contribute to the second frequency drop seen just seconds after 16:45 Thursday 5th September 2024 ? Once again, the above is all hypothesis/speculation … so most interested in hearing from the more knowledgeable readers here! What was the cloud pattern? In a conversation with someone from Overwatch Energy about this, they have helpfully provided me this image from Windy.com time-travelled back to 16:44 yesterday, showing cloud cover extensive across VIC and SA: Did rooftop PV output also drop … faster than expected? Note that Rooftop PV data is quite limited in its usefulness for this type of investigation (they are estimates in any case, and AEMO estimates are only of 30-minute cadence in any case). So I can’t really see much point in trying to look, at this point.",

    "title": "A year-by-year look a changing times for “Gate Closure #3”",
    "date": "06-09-2024 09:05:00 AM",
    "content": "Looking back at Gate Closure #3 from 2024 In this article we uncover how Gate Closure #3 – the cut-off for dispatch UIGFs – has changed over time. As noted on this Glossary Page, there are several different types of ‘Gate Closure’ applicable to operations in Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM). Other types of gate closure Paul analysed Gate Closure #2 in A long-range trend of changing times for ‘Gate Closure #2’; the cut-off for energy and FCAS market rebids, where volumes within price bands can be changed. Gate Closure #1 is the cut-off for daily market bids. These bids fix the price bands that will apply for the next trading day’s bids. Gate Closure #3 is the cut-off for UIGF submissions UIGFs are the unconstrained intermittent generation forecasts of semi-scheduled wind and solar units. A UIGF represents the estimate of maximum power in MW that a unit could deliver at the end of the dispatch interval, if unconstrained by network congestion or system security constraints. In other words, the physical availability of the unit. Here, we are talking about the UIGF used for dispatch. A forecast needs to be submitted before the start of the dispatch interval so NEMDE can apply it in its calculations. Given this, how long before the start of the interval is it needed? And to find the answer, we represent gate closure as seconds to the start of a UIGF’s relevant interval. Forecast submission time as seconds to interval-start We prepared the following chart to summarise the submission time of each individual UIGF that was used in dispatch. We are distinguishing between: AEMO forecasts which originate from AWEFS for wind, ASEFS for solar, or the simpler ‘FCST’ used when those two, more sophisticated, forecasting models are not available for use. PARTICIPANT forecasts, representing participant self-forecasts. SCADA / Last target forecasts which represent backup options if the above sources are not available. The chart is zoomed-in to 100 seconds to interval-start because this is the predominant period from which the forecasts used in dispatch are submitted. The timing of UIGFs used in dispatch has reduced from 75 seconds to 10 seconds. Observations 2019 AEMO submitted its forecasts at 75s to interval-start. There were very few participant self-forecasts. Participant self-forecasting began in September 2019. Forecasts submitted at 5s to interval-start are used, these are typically of SCADA (output power) or last target origin. 2020 The use of Participant self-forecasting was emerging. AEMO forecasts remain at 75 seconds to interval-start. We observe participant forecasts submitted around 60s to interval-start as a cluster. 2021 We can see participant self-forecasts submitted later than 60s. At times, down to 15s before interval start. 2022 These forecast submission times were still meeting gate closure. An update to the self-forecasting assessment procedure in January included a reduction in the nominal gate closure time from 70s to 15s. In November 2022 AEMO made forecast upgrades, and this included pushing out its submission times from 75s to under 20s. 2023 Systems submitted forecasts between 20s and 10s before interval-start, for use in dispatch. An April update to the self-forecasting procedure included a reduced gate closure time of 10s to interval-start (down from 15s). This is documented so that participants can have confidence forecasts meeting that submission threshold will be accepted for use in dispatch. While a bar representing forecasts submitted at 10s is not easily visible, it is there – just small (click the image for higher-resolution). 2024 Dispatch uses forecasts that have been typically offered between 20s and 10s to interval-start. There are some that were used and submitted later, between 20s and 40s. These are evident by very small bars in the 2024 chart. Two distinct groups emerged in 2023 and persist into 2024: Forecasts submitted around 19 – 17 seconds before interval-start, and Forecasts submitted 15 – 12 seconds before interval-start. Conclusions Gate closure #3 represents the cut-off time for dispatch UIGFs. This is 10 seconds, in 2024. It has been that way (although not always officially) since 2021. Dispatch uses forecasts submitted at 5s to interval-start occasionally. These represent backup forecasts selected from mechanisms secondary to AWEFS , ASEFS and the participant self-forecast . Two distinct groups exist in submission times covering most forecasts in 2023 and 2024, but these groups are both within 20s to interval-start. PS1 Inspecting just the participant self-forecasts Participants find the gate closure time of relevance if they submit UIGF self-forecasts for dispatch. Missing the cut-off means the forecast is not used in dispatch. Often, multiple submissions for a single interval will be made to ensure the most recent recent forecast is accepted. Typically, the latest one within the gate closure cut-off is used. For this reason, here is chart as above, filtered to participant forecasts: The timing of UIGFs from participant self-forecasts, used in dispatch, has reduced from 90+ seconds to 10 seconds.",

    "title": "A long-range trend of changing times for “Gate Closure #2”",
    "date": "05-09-2024 09:35:00 AM",
    "content": "This article’s just a short one, for a change. As noted on this Glossary Page, there are several different types of ‘Gate Closure’ applicable to operations in Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM): 1) Whilst it’s fairly widely understood (even across the broader suite of NEM observers) that bid bands are set at 12:30 ( NEM time ) on the prior day for each Market Day, 2) It’s only a smaller subset of people who are on top of the nuances of Gate Closure #2 : (a) Which relates to the specific timing of when volumes in those bid bands can be changed; and (b) Which is the subject of this article. 3) It’s an even smaller subset that think about Gate Closure #3 (but that deserves its own article). The topic of ‘Gate Closure #2’ has come up in several conversations recently (including in a few recent training sessions for new starters for our ez2view software), so I undertook to have a look* to see how the timing was trending. * Full Disclosure – the SQL and EMMS knowledge to produce this query is well beyond my capabilities, so others in the team quickly extracted the data for me. A long-range trend of Gate Closure #2 Starting back in 2010 we queried our internal EMMS to see what we could find, for each day over ~15 years, at the minimum time (prior to the end of a Dispatch Interval) in which a participant could submit a rebid and have it accepted* for the immediately following Dispatch Interval . * there’s plenty of rebids that are ‘too late’, in which case they might miss the price spike the participant is trying to rebid into. Quick notes: 1) Due to the complexity of the underlying data, and hence the query, there’s a few aberrations in the data that was extracted … because we only ran this query out of interest, and as the picture above provides the overall message, we did not invest the time to get to the bottom of these aberrations. 2) There’s clearly a big improvement made by AEMO towards the end of 2021 : (a) which we noticed at the time and reported in the article ‘Two recent improvements (in late November 2021) by AEMO in the dispatch process’ . (b) this (i.e. allowing receipt of rebids closer to the end of the dispatch interval) will improve the efficiency of dispatch outcomes in the NEM. 3) There’s also (potentially) something also notable happening more recently? Most recent 3 years Zooming into the most recent 3 years (and hence scaling down the y-axis) we see the following: Eyeballing this chart (for which I’ve added a 30-day rolling average), it does appear that there might have been a small increase in Gate Closure #2 time from 2023 (when it was ~12 seconds) into 2024 (slight increase to ~13 seconds).

    "title": "Which Solar Farm DUIDs were curtailed at 12:35 on Sunday 1st September 2024?",
    "date": "04-09-2024 03:03:00 PM",
    "content": "Yesterday we shared ‘Curtailment of Wind Resource (i.e. Semi-Scheduled) across the NEM reaches 53.6% on Sunday 1st September 2024’ . … In that article, we noted: (a) The quick look at Wind Curtailment had followed the earlier article (posted Monday 1st September) about ‘Curtailment of Solar Resource from (Semi-Scheduled) Large Solar across the NEM reaches 79.2% on Sunday 1st September 2024’ . (b) Which had generated quite a conversation in different parts of social media. (c) And also in the AFR by Angela MacDonald-Smith, who’d written ‘Wild winds blow up solar farm profits’ , referencing some of the content of that article. One of the other questions that Angela had asked me was ‘ which solar farms had been curtailed?’ … too which (without looking) I’d flippantly replied that it would be easier to list which ones had not curtailed … i.e. with so much energy being curtailed I’d assumed that the number of DUIDs being curtailed would be large! Curiosity prompted me this morning to have a closer look, so I utilised the ‘Fuel Type Details’ widget in ez2view focused on solar, time-travelled back to 12:35 on Sunday 1st September 2024 (i.e. the time of peak curtailment as noted in the chart here ). Here’s a snapshot, but note that the list of DUIDs (110 in total, of which 101 were accounted for in AEMO systems at the time) runs off the bottom of the visible page: Don’t worry so much about the not seeing them all, at this point – as I’ve copy-pasted from this widget to an Excel sheet, added some auto-formatting, and have presented a longer view as an image at the end of the article for your ease of reference (remember to click on the image to open larger view in different tab). Headline summary But let’s just start with the headline summary for now…. From this image we see: 1) There’s 110 solar farm DUIDs in the list … of which only 101 are actually have data published at present … I have not looked to confirm, but: i. it’s probable the some of the other 9 are in the process of commissioning ii. there may be data glitches in the EMMS with others meaning that there’s just ‘No Data’ at this point in time 2) Of the 101 DUIDs with data: (a) 55 DUIDs have some output data lower than 1MW i. i.e. because of the vagaries of physical operation and SCADA systems sometimes there are units that are notionally zero but the reality is not quite. ii. so we’ll call these units ‘OFF’ iii. but note that that’s only just over 50% of the total iv. so that’s less than I thought, when I gave Angela my flippant response on Monday (b) That leaves 46 units with some kind of (i.e. non-zero) output. (c) Not necessarily a subset of those 55 ( or mutually exclusive) there are only 9 DUIDs subject to a bound constraint : i. More specifically, they are DUIDs that are on the Left Hand Side (LHS) of a (one or more) bound constraint equation(s) ; ii. Trying not to go into the gory details : 1. this means that these 9 DUIDs may be being ‘constrained dow n’ by those bound constraint equations 2. but its not guaranteed without more data … examples below. PS1 … Headline Caveats As a PS (later on Wednesday), I thought it might be useful to add these Headline Caveats: 1) The data above shows FinalMW (and not Target) for ‘Current’ (Output) and ‘Previous’ (Output) 2) Just because a Unit shows 0MW output, it does not necessarily mean it’s been curtailed: (a) There might be no solar resource (e.g. cloud cover) or the plant could be offline. (b) If it’s 0MW because it’s curtailed, there’s insufficient data in the table shown above (and at the bottom) for the reader to ascertain why . (c) Some of the examples below help to illustrate the complexity of ascertaining this 3) Just because the Unit shows some output, it also does not mean it’s not been (partially) curtailed! (a) To understand this, you’d need to understand both the Capacity (remembering these separate caveats about Capacity ) and also the UIGF (b) And, even if it has been partially curtailed, there’s complexity in understanding why . (c) Again, see the examples below… Four particular DUIDs With that in mind, we take a look at 4 particular DUIDs … noting that there’s probably other DUIDs that would also make interesting Case Studies as well, I’m just trying to make this article not so long. For those playing along with their own copies of ez2view , I have included some explanation: 1) but note I am using version 9.9.4.361 which may be more recent the version you have installed 2) it was ‘Latest & Greatest’ until recently, but was itself superseded on Monday just passed. So let’s start up the top of the list and work down … skipping most. BANN1 (Bannerton Solar Farm) Looking alphabetically, the Bannerton Solar Farm (in VIC) is the first one in the list that’s large-size and providing some output … and also extra-interesting because it is on the LHS of (at least one) bound constraint. We can see more about this unit by clicking through to the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view … in this case the snapshot below shown with a mouse-over tool tip captured for other useful information: This particular case (somewhat randomly chosen!) is an excellent illustration of two different complexities: 1) It’s an excellent case of Marcelle’s warning that ‘Not as simple as it appears – estimating curtailment of renewable generation’ . 2) It’s also an excellent example of the complexity in Linton’s illustration ‘ What inputs and processes determine a semi-scheduled unit’s availability’ . Let’s start at the end, by saying that I would state that this unit has been ‘constrained down’ in this particular dispatch interval … even though a strict reading of the data suggests that this is not actually the case. Let’s build it up: 1) The unit ‘as bid’ has allocated 88MW to the –$1000/MWh bid band at the RRN (a) Not shown on this image directly, you need to click through to the ‘Bid Details’ widget to see this. (b) But we can see that the CPD price for this unit is –$1,000/MWh … showing the impact of transmission congestion. 2) In NEMDE, however, it’s only 45MW of volume that is considered for dispatch: (a) That’s what is shown as ‘Available’ in the column for 12:35; (b) We see that the Source is ‘Bid MaxAvail’ (c) In the mouse-over, we see that the UIGF for the unit (supplied from the self-forecast in this case) is 63MW 3) We also see that the unit is subject to two bound constraints: (a) The first in the list is the ‘V_BANNERTSF_FLT_45’ constraint equation which I’ve clicked through to access (not shown here): i. that explains its purpose as being ‘Limit Bannerton Solar Farm upper limit to 45 MW to manage post contingent voltage oscillation’ . ii. Achieves this with a very simple form, being LHS (which is only BANN1 dispatch target) <= 45MW iii. Hence my synopsis that the unit’s being ‘constrained down’ even though the dashboard above shows it as being ‘fully’ dispatched to its Availability . (b) The other bound constraint is the ‘V>>V_BURC_5’ constraint equation … which we’ll revisit further down in this article. 4) What complicates the story further is that the unit’s had its bid limited to 45MW (also!) because of the use of that number in MaxAvail. … so different readers might wonder which one was chicken, and which one was the egg? BOMENSF1 (Bomen Solar Farm) Stepping through the list we next stop at BOMENSF1 in NSW – which has output, but no constraint. Here’s the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view : In this case we see that: 1) Not subject to a bound constraint, as we noted above 2) It’s dispatched at 69MW: (a) Which is its Availability (b) Source of the Availability is also a self-forecast 3) The reason it’s not dispatched down is: (a) that the RRP in the NSW region is –$57.01/MWh in this Dispatch Interval (b) but its volume is bid at –$67.73/MWh at the RRN (c) so the Generator’s said that it would be happy to pay a bit more (presumably its own unique ‘ negative LGC ’) in order to keep generating. GNNDHSF1 (Gunnedah Solar Farm) Skipping a few in the list, we’ve next selected Gunnedah Solar Farm, which: 1) is similar to BOMENSF1 in that: (a) It’s also in NSW; and (b) Also not on the LHS of a Bound Constraint 2) Yet different from the above in that there’s no output. Here’s the relevant ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view : In this case we see the unit saying that it’s only prepared to pay (up to) $50/MWh for the privilege of generating (presumably its own unique ‘ negative LGC ’) … but the RRP is below that (and hence the CPD price in the absence of constraints and intervention), so it’s ‘dispatched off’ (or ‘Economically Curtailed’) . KARSF1 (Karadoc Solar Farm) Skipping a few more in the list, we’ve next selected Karadoc Solar Farm, which: 1) Is producing some output (indeed it has ramped up , from 12:30 to 12:35); and yet 2) Is on the LHS of a bound constraint. Here’s the relevant ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view : In this case we’ve highlighted both 12:30 and 12:35 in the table, because: 1) At 12:30 the unit was ‘constrained down’ … although not fully: (a) It’s Target of 6MW was below its Availability of 20MW (b) We note the CPD Price of –$68.15/MWh was equal to where the volume was offered in its bid. 2) But for 12:35 a rebid was submitted: (a) Looks to be an autobidder … the rebid reasons might suggest one of the auto-bidder vendors we identified in Appendix 22 within GenInsights21 a couple years ago. (b) Volume was shifted down to the –$1,000/MWh bid band (c) Which alleviated the impact of this constraint on this particular unit: i. So we see output ramp back up … from 7MW to 19MW, which is its Availability, which is set by its own self-forecast. ii. And makes one wonder where the focus of the constraint has shifted … i.e. who else has been constrained down as a result? The ‘V>>V_BURC_5’ constraint equation Clicking through to the ‘Constraint Dashboard’ widget in ez2view , we see that this is the ‘V>>V_BURC_5’ constraint equation mentioned above for BANN1 There’s a wealth of data available in this widget (and it’s only recently been upgraded for a post- IESS world) but I will only highlight a couple things: 1) The ‘Standing Data’ tab explains: (a) the description of the constraint is … ‘Out= Buronga to Redcliffs (0X1) 220kV line, avoid O/L Waubra to Ballarat 220kV line on trip of Kerang to Bendigo 220kV line, Feedback’ ; (b) its one constraint equation in the ‘I-BURC’ Constraint Set , which: i. relates to ‘Out = Buronga to Red Cliffs (0X1) 220kV line’ ; and ii. contains many constraint equations … iii. including the ‘V_BANNERTSF_FLT_45’ constraint equation we saw above. 2) I’ve highlighted the rows with pink colouring for ‘Available’, denoting that there’s capacity available that’s not dispatched (i.e. not covered with a grey bar that’s overlaid for Target). 3) We can see, with reference to several columns in the relevant rows that: (a) The Bulgana Battery has bid not to be dispatched, in either direction, at this point. (b) Bulgana Wind Farm has bid such that it would have been ‘constrained down’ … if it had not been ‘economically curtailed’ in the first place (c) The Murra Warra Wind Farm #1 has been both: i. Economically curtailed, first; ii. But, if it had not been (i.e. had RRP been higher), with CPD price below ‘Next MW @’ then it would have also been constrained down (d) In contrast, with ‘Next MW @’ up at $17,500/MWh the Murra Warra Wind Farm #2 really did not want to get a Target. (e) Yatpool solar Farm is also bid out of the market. (f) As is Kiata Wind Farm . And that’s where we’ll leave these individual examples… Full list of 110 x Solar Farm DUIDs Here’s the full list:",

    "title": "Comparing winter temperatures at Archerfield over 19 years of history",
    "date": "04-09-2024 08:34:00 AM",
    "content": "The month of August really seemed to be ‘the tale of two halves’, with: 1) The Southern Half of the NEM beset by strong winds and wild weather, whilst 2) The Northern Half experienced what certainly seemed to be unusually hot weather… even before winter 2024 ended (although it cooled back to more ‘normal’ temperatures yesterday). Given that many of our team are based in and around Brisbane, and particularly in locations where Archerfield temperature is more typical of what we feel than Brisbane airport (along with being perhaps a better determinant of electricity demand in Brisbane) I was interested to have a look this chart created in the ‘Trends Engine’ within ez2view : In this chart we can clearly see both: 1) the spike in daily maximum temperature on Saturday 17th August 2024 (30.4C) 2) but, more significantly, the ~11 day ramp up in daily maximum temperature to Saturday 31st August 2024 . (a) With the highest point being 36.4 °C on that Saturday i. Last day of ‘ winter 2024 ’! ii. Which, coincidentally, was captured in the NEMwatch snapshot when we wrote about low demand in NSW on that day . (b) Noting that there was also a notable ramp in daily minimum temperature points, as well. Whilst that ramp in temperatures were underway, it certainly felt unusual … but I wondered how unusual it would appear if we used our growing history of weather observations stored in the ‘Trends Engine’ within ez2view (also accessible in NEMreview v7 ) to compare … 19 years of daily maximum temperatures at Archerfield So in the chart below we’ve utilised the same 5-month date range (i.e. May to September) to cover the (normally!) cooler months There’s too many years shown here to colour them all – but we have used colour to call out: 1) The sustained ramp in temperature at the end of winter 2024; 2) Which does stand out, but is not totally unique , with (shorter duration) spikes also seen: (a) In Winter 2009: i. With a peak of 35.3°C on 24th August 2009 ii. Which was recorded at the time in the article ‘A beautiful summer’s day for South-East Queensland – in August’ . (b) In Winter 2017 i. With a spike on 17th August 2017 (to 32.5 °C) ii. I could not see any record of it here, on a quick scan. (c) Just after the close of Winter 2019 i. The spike was to 33.3 °C was on 4th September 2019 ii. Which was technically after winter ended, but that’s just splitting hairs, perhaps. 3) We can see many more years seeing daily maximum temperatures above 30 °C by the end of September. 19 years of daily minimum temperatures at Archerfield Given we’d already extracted the data for daily minimum points (in the process of completing the above) I was curious to see how these points also compared – with the same 4 (of 19) years highlighted: With respect to this chart: 1) There’s two jumps in daily minimum points apparent through August 2024 in this chart: (a) There was a more obvious jump over 4-5 days centred on 13th August 2024 and 14th August 2024; and (b) There’s the ramp at the end of the month, as well (c) Though perhaps it’s better to look at the broader ramp through the whole of August 2024 from the lowest point in the year (2.7 °C on 1st August 2024). 2) But the larger observation that jumps out to me here is the larger range in daily minimum points (perhaps a 15°C range) compared to daily maximum points in the chart above (perhaps a 10°C range) across all of those years. If 2009, 2017 and 2019 were ‘most similar’, does that provide any pointers to summer 2024-25? I am certainly not a meteorologist, so will leave to others to answer that question – but recalling that summer 2009-10, summer 2017-18 and summer 2019-20 all had their challenges, one does wonder … That’s where I’ll leave it, for now…",

    "date": "03-09-2024 10:05:00 AM",
    "content": "Over the past couple days, we’ve posted a number of article – including these three that have resonated externally for various reasons, and which we’ll reference further in this article: Article #1) On Sunday afternoon we posted ‘‘Minimum Demand’ point for NSW drops 226MW from last year’s low point (on Sunday 1st September 2024)’ Article #2) On Monday morning we posted ‘High wind yield in recent days … but *not* a new all-time record’ . In that article we’d noted the cyclic nature of wind farm production in recent days and pondered the extent to which it was related to any a number of factors, including: Factor #1) Economic curtailment during peak daylight (i.e. rooftop PV yield) hours ; Factor #2) Network curtailment ; Factor #3) Possible high-speed wind cut-out on wind farms; Factor #4) We wondered whether (perhaps) the wind actually dropped (but later in the article, using the ‘ Forecast Convergence ’ we showed the underlying UIGF and ruled this option out as a possible factor)? Article #3) Also Monday morning, we posted ‘Curtailment of Solar Resource from (Semi-Scheduled) Large Solar across the NEM reaches 79.2% on Sunday 1st September 2024’ . Following from which we’d also referenced this article: (a) In this update on LinkedIn … but note it was referenced in plenty of other places as well. (b) In several updates on Twitter including this one In addition to the social media buzz about Article #3 yesterday afternoon we saw Angela MacDonald-Smith had written ‘Wild winds blow up solar farm profits’ , referencing some of the content in that article – and the other market outcomes mentioned in Article #1 and Article #2 as well. In writing her article, Angela asked me about the extent to which there had also been wind curtailment , but I did not have time to give a detailed answer until this companion article this morning, via a similar trend from ez2view (except not Large Solar, but instead all the Semi-Scheduled Wind Farms across the NEM): In reading the chart above, remember Marcelle’s very relevant note of caution that ‘Not as simple as it appears – estimating curtailment of renewable generation’ . We see that: 1) This shows the most recent 11 days completely (i.e. from Friday 23rd August 2024 through until Monday 2nd September 2024 ), and into this morning (but not yet with ‘Next Day Public’ data); 2) Across all 11 days (in the blue line ) we can see a trend of the instantaneous curtailment of the aggregate Wind Resource (i.e. the UIGF) across all Semi-Scheduled wind farms; 3) Across 5 days in particular, we see that this level of curtailment peaks above 50% during peak rooftop PV yield times: (a) Saturday 24th August 2024 ; (b) Sunday 25th August 2024 ; (c) Friday 30th August 2024 ; (d) Saturday 31st August 2024 ; (e) Sunday 1st September 2024 ; 4) Remember those factors could be at play here: Factor #1) It seems highly likely that there would have been strong economic curtailment during peak daylight (i.e. rooftop PV yield) hours, given the negative prices shown in the same chart at the same time; Factor #2) Also possible is some network curtailment … perhaps also due to the all the steps AEMO took to secure different network elements with the Severe Weather Factor #3) We’ve wondered about the possibility of high-speed cut-out on wind farm (a) noting that Ashleigh Madden wrote ‘Have the fierce winds in Tas caused wind farm cutouts?’ for Weatherzone (b) if time permits, we’d like to take our own look at some point. So will leave this article here, for now, and potentially explore in more depth in subsequent articles in the coming days and weeks…",

    "date": "02-09-2024 02:37:00 PM",
    "content": "The recent bout of strong winds lashing the southern states may have been supported by a case of sudden stratospheric warming. Warming in the stratosphere over Antarctica can drive the Southern Ocean westerly wind belt towards the Equator. This typically means stronger winds to southern Australia. And this means greater potential for wind-powered electricity generation. Stratospheric warming in July 2024 Back about 5 weeks ago on the 27 th July, the ABC reported that around early-July “the temperature more than 20 kilometres above the east Antarctic coastline suddenly warmed by about 50 degrees Celsius in a week”. This represented a case of Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW), an unusual situation for the southern hemisphere. The ABC article went on to explain that typically “this sudden change over the stratosphere will then filter down and disrupt the troposphere (the layer of atmosphere where weather occurs), which can result in prolonged spells of extreme weather for weeks .” A Weatherzone article explained how SSW events can influence winds in Australia. It described a sequence of “domino” effects where, some weeks after the warming event has happened in the troposphere, the warming event can end up altering the position of the surface-level westerly winds that typically blow between Antarctica and Australia. The altered position of the westerlies tends to be further north (towards the Equator). It is measured by an index known as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). When these westerly airstreams are further north the SAM is in a negative phase. For us in the NEM, Weatherzone note in that same article that a negative SAM typically brings: More cold fronts and low-pressure systems over southern Australia Increased rainfall and snow potential in southwest and southeast Australia Reduced rainfall in parts of eastern Australia Stronger winds in the southern half of Australia I’ve bolded the last point for emphasis as that’s exactly what we’ve experienced over the last days and weeks in VIC, SA and TAS! Readers may recall related coverage of the windy weather at WattClarity including: It could be a high wind yield week ahead in the NEM? Wild winds in TAS drive aggregate instantaneous Wind Farm capacity factor close to 100% and High wind yield in recent days: but *not* a new all-time record Here’s a visual depiction of a negative SAM from the Bureau of Meteorology , showing the westerly wind belt sitting further north. Source: Australian Bureau of Meteorology And here is a chart of mean sea-level pressure isobars, and forecast rainfall, covering Tuesday 27 th August 2024. Source: Australian Bureau of Meteorology Since early July there has been a second warming event The ABC article from July included a chart of Zonal Mean Temperature for the Antarctic troposphere that showed the SSW event of early July as a spike. The following update to that same analysis chart ( NOAA’s climate prediction Center ) includes that period – July 2024 temperatures eclipsed the max line at their peak. What’s also interesting is the second spike in warming early in August, peaking well above the 90 th percentile level. This was forecast in in the outlooks from mid-July. Source: NOAA Climate Prediction Center Returning to a neutral SAM… for now As at 17 August, the Southern Annular Mode had indeed been negative. It had been negative since 21 st July. In the latest update (as at 31 st August) it had returned to a more neutral setting. Right now, outside my window, its hailing. The wild weather continues!",

    "content": "Last week we wrote ‘Curtailment (spillage) of Large Solar reaches 2/3 of total resource, on Saturday 24th August 2024’ . Well, with NSW seeing a substantial drop in ‘minimum demand’ point on Sunday 1st September 2024 , it was natural to wonder what it meant in terms of curtailment of Large Solar across the NEM (noting is only determined for Semi-Scheduled units and not for the couple smaller Non-Scheduled units). So, taking the same query from the ‘Trends Engine’ in ez2view – but adding in an explicit calculation for ‘% curtailment (i.e. of the capability at the time)’ in blue , we see some pretty startling numbers: We see: 1) Curtailment (mainly due to economic curtailment , we suspect) on Saturday 24th August 2024 actually exceeded 70% briefly … a bit higher than our 66% eyeball estimate 2) Over the recent weekend the numbers are worse still: (a) On Saturday 31st August 2024 we see curtailment levels approach 74% (b) Yesterday (Sunday 1st September 2024 ) we see curtailment levels reach 79.2% . . .. rooftop PV* is killing its big brother! * amongst other factors … like the ongoing dispatch of coal, at least in part for its ‘Keeping the Lights on Services’ that are not yet replaced. Yikes! 1) Who’d want to build a new (stand-alone) Large Solar Farm in the NEM? 2) Bargain basement prices for anyone trying to sell one , as well? 3) Should the designers of the Capacity Investment Scheme be considering only providing support for solar projects if they are developed as fully Scheduled hybrid projects ? … this was something discussed in GenInsights Quarterly Updates for 2024 Q2 .",

    "content": "On Friday we wrote ‘Might get close to a new all-time record for wind production late this weekend?’ . So it was of interest (especially due to the Severe Weather warnings for TAS … and then for SA and VIC ) to take a quick look at the same pre-prepared ‘Trends Engine’ query from within ez2view to see how close we reached: As we can see in this chart: 1) The highest point in recent days was 8,094MW on the evening of Friday 30th August 2024 ; 2) Yield was high over the weekend (it’s really been high since 20th August 2024 ) – but important to note that the weekend yield might have been artificially lower due to: Factor #1) It seems highly likely that there would have been strong economic curtailment during peak daylight (i.e. rooftop PV yield) hours, given the negative prices we saw in the NEMwatch snapshots when NSW hit new lowest points on Saturday 31st August and Sunday 1st September ; Factor #2) Also possible is some network curtailment … perhaps also due to the all the steps AEMO took to secure different network elements with the Severe Weather Factor #3) We’ve wondered about the possibility of high-speed cut-out on wind farm (a) noting that Ashleigh Madden wrote ‘Have the fierce winds in Tas caused wind farm cutouts?’ for Weatherzone (b) if time permits, we’d like to take our own look at some point.

Curiosity dragged me a bit further, to open up the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view to look at NEMwide Wind UIGF … and I can’t recall this view ever looking like this one?! Remember that one can use this widget to ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to ‘see that other dimension of time ’. We see that the 4-day stretch of strong winds (from Thursday 29th August 2024 evening to Monday 2nd September 2024 evening) suggests that the dips in actual harvest shown above were not due to any dips in wind (i.e. ruling out Factor #4 above).",

    "title": "What’s the 2024 ESOO say about Data Centres?",
    "date": "31-08-2024 06:47:00 PM",
    "content": "This article is more of an extract from the 2024 ESOO , for ease of our future reference, than any particular piece of analysis. We’ve done this because (as noted in ‘once through the ESOO’ ) we’ve asked Dan Lee to prepare some analysis that might be posted later in the year to help us understand what the current state is with respect to Data Centres across the NEM, including stakeholders, locations, and electrical characteristics (including size and market participation). Excerpt from the ESOO Starting on p26/177 in Chapter 2, the the AEMO notes: ‘Accelerating investment in data centres is an emerging driver of growth ’ (i.e. in electricity demand) … and then: ‘Accelerating investment in data centres to cater for the projected demand for streaming services, cloud storage and artificial intelligence (AI) applications, is emerging as a significant contributor to forecast demand. While data centres will increase annual consumption, the potential flexibility of these loads and/or the provision of on-site generation means that their impact on maximum demand is uncertain.’ … and then (p27/177): ‘The expansion of data centres – specifically with the rise of larger hyperscale facilities – has the potential to be a catalyst for substantial increases in electricity consumption for New South Wales and Victoria in particular. ’ … and also ‘An increase in data centre, mining and manufacturing load is responsible for over half of forecast load growth for large industrial users over the next 10 years. Load growth related to the development of new large-scale data centres in particular outpaces projections from previous ESOOs (which have not historically identified these facilities as an explicit driver of new load growth).’ … and also (p33/177) as follows (noting LIL stands for Large Industrial Loads, now including Data Centres): ‘The LIL forecasts have been updated for the 2024 ESOO by surveying industrial facilities directly and gathering load inquiry data from network service providers (NSPs). LIL forecasts in the ESOO Central scenario are higher than was forecast in the 2023 ESOO, largely due to the reallocation of approximately 60 sites from the BMM to the LIL category. Approximately half of the reclassified loads consist of existing data centres , which have experienced substantial growth since the 2023 ESOO. The resulting increase due to this reclassification is partly offset by a reduction in the BMM consumption. The potential growth in new data centre load is separately analysed in the Accelerated Data Centre Growth sensitivity , which considered the realisation of more prospective loads (footnote 43).’ … so that means (if I have interpreted correctly ~30 Data Centre sites across the NEM currently . For completeness, Footnote 43 reads as follows: ‘AEMO has only considered committed data centre loads in the core scenario forecasts. Anticipated loads whereby proponents may be well progressed with pursuing the connection, although have not yet achieved Final Investment Decision, have only been considered in the Accelerated Data Centre Growth sensitivity.’ Chapter 2 continues (p34/177) with the following: ‘The LIL forecasts are higher across all scenarios compared to the 2023 ESOO, due to the reclassification of load from the BMM sector. The newly-classified loads account for almost 10% (or nearly 4 TWh) of current total LIL load . Long-term growth in the ESOO Central scenario is driven by data centres, transport, mining and manufacturing. Existing and committed data centres in particular are forecast to make up just over 5% (or approximately 500 MW) of the total LIL load by 2033-34 . This is balanced out by production downgrades from some manufacturing sites due to reported high domestic production costs and a growing reliance on imports.’ Exploring the potential for rapid data centre growth Under the heading ‘Exploring the potential for rapid data centre growth’ on p35/177, the AEMO notes: ‘Data centres make up nearly 3 TWh of current load across the BMM and LIL sectors . The ESOO Central scenario forecasts around 5 TWh of data centre load by 2033-34, from existing and committed LIL projects alone. Accelerating investment in data centres to meet the potential growth in demand for streaming services, cloud storage and AI applications – specifically with the rise of larger hyperscale facilities – has the potential to be a catalyst for substantial increases in electricity consumption, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne (but potentially in more regional areas too with the right infrastructure and relevant incentives) … footnote 49. ’ Assuming a flat consumption profile for the 3TWh consumption this would equate to ~340MW constant consumption . So a growth of ~2TWh to 5TWh is not insignificant, but also not of the scale of aluminium smelting (for instance). Footnote 49 (referenced above) reads: ‘Development opportunities will depend on relevant available infrastructure , including electricity, data connectivity, water as well as labour to develop and maintain facilities and environmental and planning requirements. To date, much of the development interest is within the major capitals, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. Supporting development in other locations, such as co-locating data centres with new electricity supply developments , may represent an opportunity for governments, data centre developers and infrastructure providers and may influence on power system requirements.’ The main text continues: ‘The 2024 ESOO explores potentially large increases in investment in data centres in a sensitivity to the Central scenario, the Accelerated Data Centre Growth sensitivity. The sensitivity was informed by 2024 Standing Information Request responses received from NSPs and other industry engagement on data centre application enquiries and non-committed loads. The sensitivity forecasts nearly 10 TWh of additional load per year by 2033-34, which is assumed to continue rising over the next 30 years (see Figure 11 below). Based on this trajectory, data centres are estimated to make up nearly 15% of LIL consumption and around 5% of total NEM operational consumption by 2033-34 , staying at this proportion until 2053-54. Around two-thirds of the consumption from these more prospective projects is assumed to be located in New South Wales, particularly in the Western Sydney area, one-fifth in Victoria, and the remainder in Queensland and Tasmania (see Figure 12 below).’ ‘Increased investment in data centres will increase annual electricity consumption, and impact forecast peak demands. Based on analysis of existing data centres, these facilities are estimated to have a relatively stable demand shape that is not materially temperature sensitive. Ambient temperatures marginally increase summer loads, with cooler ambient temperatures reducing cooling load in winter. Data centres may also have diesel generation backup to potentially reduce peak demand impacts.’ From Appendix A6 (Demand Side Participation Forecast) As noted in ‘once through the ESOO’ , because of the role we’ve played over ~20 years in facilitating a certain form of demand response in the NEM, we’ll be interested to refer back to Appendix A6 (p164/177) in more detail separately. But in this article, the particular focus is what it says in terms of Data Centres. However in a quick scan it seems that’s limited to the comment: ‘AEMO’s improved identification and classification of virtual power plants and data centres has helped to recognise this larger DSP participation in Victoria , and similarly, to a smaller extent in New South Wales .’ … which is with respect to Table 39, copied in here: The ‘Accelerated Data Centre Growth’ sensitivity Obviously this will be of further interest, as we delve further… In the ‘Forecasting Assumptions Update’ report from 29th August 2024, it notes (p35/54): ‘AEMO’s 2024 LIL forecast is higher than in the 2023 IASR, due to the reallocation of about 60 sites from the Business Mass Market (BMM) sector to the LIL sector. The increased LIL consumption resulting from the reallocation is counterbalanced by a lower BMM forecast. • About half of the newly reallocated LILs are data centres which have a large growth potential. In the 2024 Step Change scenario, data centres are the fastest growing segment within LILs. Committed and existing data centres are forecast to consume almost 5 TWh per year by the early 2040s. • More prospective (footnote 38) data centres loads were included in the 2024 Accelerated Data Centre Growth sensitivity that showed an increase of more than 10 TWh of annual consumption in this market segment alone by the 2040s . • The loads that were classified as LIL in the 2023 ESOO show a slight decrease in the forecast due to lower desalination water orders in the short term and production downgrades in mining and manufacturing in the longer term. Similar to the 2024 Step Change scenario, the alternative scenarios are higher compared to the 2023 ESOO, due to the reallocation of sites from the BMM to the LIL sector, compensated by slight downgrades in mining and manufacturing. The 2024 Progressive Change scenario also forecasts a lower risk of closures for some LILs in the short term (2022-26). ‘ … with Footnote 38 reading: ‘The sensitivity was informed by the 2024 Standing Information Request responses received from NSPs and other industry engagement on data centre application enquiries and non-committed loads.’ This report continued: ‘The LIL consumption forecast for all scenarios is shown in Figure 18.’ That’s all for now…",

    "date": "30-08-2024 12:20:00 PM",
    "content": "Was speaking earlier this morning with someone about how some of the widgets in ez2view could be used to gain some sense of changing generator* outage plans (via screenshare) and I noticed something I thought might be more generally of interest. * alas only fully Scheduled units, as Semi-Scheduled unit outages remain invisible , from this perspective! So I started typing … and, in the process of doing so, was gazumped by some good news… (A) Return to service commences Lo and behold, the alerts triggered from the ‘Notifications’ widget in ez2view give us the good news! In this snapshot of an email received at 11:56 on Friday 30th August 2024 we see that Callide C4 has reached 26MW on its way to returning to service (after an outage that began way back on 25th May 2021). (B) In the AEMO market data via ez2view We’ve written a number of articles before about the long-running outage at Callide C4 (longest outage in the history of the NEM, perhaps) and noticed that there’d been some interesting changes in plans for the unit – as we see firstly in the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view (snapshot at 11:40, so just prior to restart) here: With respect to this image, note the following 1) Return to service expectation remained (in the snapshot above) that it would be available for part-load tomorrow (a) i.e. 210MW availability on Saturday 31st August 2024 ; (b) but keep in mind that this MT PASA DUID Availability data for tomorrow is ‘stale’ (i.e. last updated for 18:00 on Saturday 24th August 2024) so potentially could have changed (c) but note that there is a green cell for Sunday 1st September 2024 , so we know that plans can’t have changed by too much. (d) and indeed, as we see above it’s started to return a bit early. 2) My recollection was that (the last time I looked specifically at this unit), it was going to sit with availability at 210MW for a week or so before stepping up to 420MW. 3) However now we see: (a) Lower availability (i.e. 168MW) for Sunday 1st September 2024 and Monday 2nd September 2024 (b) Then stepping up (210MW) for three days (c) Before a three-day outage (Friday 6th September, Saturday 7th September and Sunday 8th September) … presumably some form of post-rebuild and commissioning inspection (d) Then 7 days available at 420MW (e) Followed by a one-day outage (Monday 16th September) (f) After which it will be available up at its Maximum Capacity (i.e. 466MW) (g) Except for some deratings on 22nd and 23rd September that also look like some form of commissioning related activity. I could not remember seeing this when I last looked (but I note that the image posted yesterday at the bottom of this article did indeed have the same) so I wonder when these changes were made. Thankfully, the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view (again, snapshot at 11:40 … just prior to restart) provides a ready-made way of seeing changes such as these: Remember that this widget allows one to ‘ look up a vertical ’ to ‘see that other dimension of time ’ We can see both: 1) The upper change (horizontally) which was added for yesterday morning (Thursday 29th August 2024 … not noticed in all the focus on the 2024 ESOO ) ; plus also 2) Plans (the vertical slice) for a ‘major’ outage slated for April-May 2025. (C) Any updates from Stakeholders? There’s no more recent update from CS Energy here on their news page than what was published at 12th July 2024 (which we recorded as ‘Callide C4 return to service pushed back 3 weeks, now slated for late July 2024’ shortly afterwards). But I have noticed a series of updates on their LinkedIn page , with the latest being this one from about 3 weeks ago: Fingers crossed for a smooth return-to-service (and commissioning) over the coming weeks!",

So it’s not really a surprise to see that Ben Domensino wrote about ‘Five more days of damaging winds for southern Australia’ on Weatherzone yesterday: I wondered what this might mean for aggregate wind yields over the coming days, so firstly jumped to this pre-prepared trend from ez2view looking at: 1) actual wind production levels (backwards in time); and 2) AEMO’s UIGF (forwards in time … noting that this is a forecast capability , and that the output might be moderated by VRE curtailment for economic or network reasons) Highlighted on this chart are: 1) A period early morning on Monday 26th August 2024 when aggregate wind yield … noting that Grid Demand is diurnally low at that point 2) Forecast peak in wind capability above 8,000MW over the weekend: (a) Just above 8,000MW briefly in the early hours of Saturday 31st August 2024 ; and (b) Slightly higher in the early hours of Monday 2nd September 2024 .

    "title": "What’s the 2024 ESOO assume, in terms of coal unit performance?",
    "date": "29-08-2024 03:16:00 PM",
    "content": "A year ago (with respect to the 2023 ESOO ), we’d noted that ‘The 2023 ESOO report shows coal unit EFOR is still a significant factor’ . Earlier this week (on Monday 26th August 2024) we wrote ‘Coal-fired unit performance has improved markedly from the ‘dog year’ that was 2022’ . At the bottom of Monday’s article we’d written: ‘Some things to watch out for, in the ESOO… As such, when the 2024 ESOO comes out later in the week, I’ll be interested to see: 1) Whether the EFOR (Equivalent Forced Outage Rate) for coal units has been adjusted from what was assumed in the 2023 ESOO … and, if so, how and why? 2) I’m also interested to see whether the AEMO continues with the approach taken in the past – in which it’s produced a common EFOR for all coal units in a region : (a) such as noted here for the 2023 ESOO (b) which, as we can see in the above, is a simplification … so those familiar with the Monte-Carlo processes used in modelling processes such as for the ESOO can think about how that might influence the results derived.’ (A) Information published by the AEMO So it was with particular interest (when skimming through the 2024 ESOO) to note the following… (A1) Information published in the 2024 ESOO We need to skip to Section 3.3 (p53/177) to get to the meat and potatoes of what’s assumed in this run of the model: ‘ 3.3 Generator unplanned outage rates AEMO collects outage information for existing scheduled generators, including storage units, through an annual survey process . This survey collects data on the timing, duration, and de-rating of historical unplanned outages. The collected data is then used to calculate long duration (full unplanned outages greater than five months), full, and partial unplanned outage rates for each financial year and each station over the ESOO horizon. Planned outages are not modelled in the NEM ESOO; AEMO’s methodology reasonably assumes that operators will plan these in lower demand periods, and will shift maintenance events if low reserve conditions were to occur, and therefore will not be a reason for unavailability during events that will risk forecast unserved energy. AEMO also collected unplanned outage rate projections from the operators for selected coal-fired and large gas-fired generators for each financial year over the ESOO horizon. These operator-provided projections reflect the expected change in performance as generators age, approach retirement, and undergo maintenance cycles. AEMO reviewed these projections against historical outages and consultant derived projections ( footnote 73 ) . In limited circumstances where operator-provided projections are mis-aligned with historical and consultant derived trends, and/or are not sufficiently justified, AEMO applies consultant projections in consultation with each relevant operator. For all other generator and storage types, the unplanned outage rates applied in the ESOO modelling were calculated from those unplanned outages observed over the last four years (2019-20 to 2023-24) as a constant projection. Figure 21 shows the historical and projected equivalent full unplanned outage rates for coal-fired generators (aggregated to protect the confidentiality of information provided by participants). These rates are shown with and without long duration unplanned outage rates. The projection takes into account the generators that are assumed to be included within the generation fleet available in each year, as such improvements in aggregate projected unplanned outage rates for a generation class are mostly due to the expected retirement of units with high outage rates , rather than expectations of improved performance across the asset class. Historical coal-fired generation reliability showed performance improvement in 2023-24 compared to previous years in New South Wales, while improvements observed in Queensland are offset by increased occurrences of long duration outages . Relative to the 2023 ESOO, unplanned outage rates for coal generators are lower than previously projected , while unplanned outage rates for gas generators are higher than previously projected. The 2024 Forecasting Assumptions Update provides detailed information on the parameters for unplanned outages for each technology ( footnote 74 ). ’ (A2) In the AEP Elical report from 2020 Footnote 73 references the report ‘Assessment of Ageing Coal-Fired Generation Reliability’ from AEP Elical (from 20th June 2020): … but I’ve note yet had time to refresh my memory of what’s in there. (A3) In the ‘ESOO and Reliability Forecast Methodology Document’ from 2023 Footnote 74 references this ‘2024 Forecasting Assumptions update’ which is linked on this subsite (which was the URL referenced at that footnote): In section 2.3 of this document (from p45) we see the following: … and section 2.3.1 continues: ‘2.3.1 Generator unplanned outage rates For the 2024 ESOO, AEMO collected outage information for existing scheduled generators including storage units, via an annual survey process , on the timing, duration, and de-rating of historical unplanned outages. This data is then used to forecast the full and partial unplanned outage rates (UORs) for each financial year, for each generator over the ESOO horizon consistent with the ESOO and Reliability Forecasting Methodology. For small peaking plants and hydro generator technology types, technology aggregates are applied to individual stations. Where AEMO requested participants to provide outage rate projections, these projections were adopted in consultation with the station owners/operators. Long duration unplanned outages For the 2024 ESOO, AEMO models long duration unplanned outages (outages with a duration longer than five months) for each region and technology class, using the last 14 years of historical outage data , from 2010-11 to 2023-24, before calculating the forecast UOR. The long duration outages used in 2024 ESOO modelling, and in other reliability assessments such as Medium Term Projected Assessment of System Adequacy (MT PASA) and Energy Adequacy Assessment Projection (EAAP) , are shown in Table 13. Unplanned outage rate (equivalent) trajectories (excluding long duration outages) The forecast equivalent full and partial UORs by technology for 2024-25, the first year of the forecast horizon period in the 2024 ESOO, are based on participant-provided information as shown in Table 14. Relative to the values used in the 2023 ESOO, the rates have generally increased for gas-fired and brown coal-fired generators but have reduced marginally for black coal-fired and hydro generators. The 10-year projections for the equivalent full UOR52 of all technology aggregates are shown in Figure 26, Figure 27 and Figure 28 with and without the effect of long duration outages. The annual equivalent UOR is affected by changes to assumed reliability and retirements of generators over the horizon. To protect the confidentiality of the individual stationlevel information used, UOR projections are provided for the next 10 years for technology aggregates. Due to the small number of coal plant in later years, all regions have been further aggregated to an ‘All Coal’ value to protection confidentiality. ’ Note that the Figure 26 referenced above was Figure 21 shown above from the 2024 ESOO. (A4) In the ‘ESOO and Reliability Forecast Methodology Document’ from 2023 Table 12 above reference F points to the ‘ESOO and Reliability Forecast Methodology Document’ from August 2023 . (i.e. produced in time for the 2023 ESOO, but not updated for the 2024 ESOO). Inside that document, section 2.3 addresses ‘Dispatchable production unit outage rates’ over 3 pages, with the first (p10/35) being as follows: On this page I have highlighted several passages. On the 3rd page (p12/35) this section concludes: ‘Note: • Unplanned outage rates for units without participant provided projections are derived based on the most recent four years of data only. This approximates well the longer-term outage rates seen by most technologies. • AEMO calculates outage parameters for a number of technology aggregations for the published model to avoid exposing confidential information .’ (B) Subsequent thoughts… A couple of thoughts as a result: (B1) No drop in EFOR assumed After reading through the above, I thought it would be useful to compare the same figures from the prior versions of the ESOO in the following table: From the 2024 ESOO From the 2023 ESOO From the 2022 ESOO Here’s that Figure 21 (noted above) again: In the 2023 ESOO it was Figure 19: In the 2022 ESOO it was Figure 20: Readers should remember that they can click on each image to open in larger view in another tab … but should be able to see that: 1) In the 2022 ESOO the analysis displayed a longer range of history, and the EFOR forecast was below 10% across each region. 2) Undoubtedly part because of the awful performance of coal units through 2022 , in the 2023 ESOO the EFOR stepped up , to be around 10% for all 3 regions. 3) In the 2024 ESOO we see that the assumed EFOR is largely the same as in the 2023 ESOO. … which is interesting, given the improved performance seen in the 18 months to 30th June 2024 . (B2) The reason for region-wide averages Additionally, the explanation above suggests that: 1) The methodology utilises information submitted confidentially by individual generators – both in terms of historical performance, and projections for the future. 2) Which is the reason why region averages are provided for EFOR . 3) Which means that (for instance) the better performing Loy Yang B gets treated the same as the Yallourn units, which are older and more challenged. Given that the MT PASA DUID Availability data was enhanced from 9th October 2023 , I wonder if this might not be a catalyst to use that data as a means for developing station-specific metrics for EFOR in future years? (B3) Long duration outages in QLD Above we quoted where the AEMO had written ‘improvements observed in Queensland are offset by increased occurrences of long duration outages . ’ … so that’s something we might look into further, as time permits (i.e. I can’t think of any long-duration outages beyond Callide C4 (which started 25th May 2021) and Callide C3 (which started 31st October 2022), so I wonder if: 1) The effect was just due to a rolling sampling window (i.e. the 14 years noted above) ; or 2) If there were other long outages I have forgotten about? (B4) Gas units Finally, the AEMO above makes reference to certain large gas units, which we’ve not been looking at so much to date. ‘while unplanned outage rates for gas generators are higher than previously projected. ‘ … something else for us to keep an eye on. (C) Currently… And, whilst we’re talking about coal unit performance, I thought it would be topical to share this filtered view of the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view from the 14:00 dispatch interval this afternoon: What’s particularly notable for me is that (excepting the forced outage at Callide C4 – which only has a day or two to go) none of the the other 43 coal units operational in the NEM have forced outages currently, or have near-term schedule for forced outages. At the risk of jinxing things, I might note that (I believe) that’s the first time I’ve seen that in the couple of years that we’ve been providing the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view !",

    "title": "Once through the ESOO (for 2024)",
    "date": "29-08-2024 12:39:00 PM",
    "content": "Earlier today we noted that the ‘AEMO released 2024 ESOO on Thursday 29th August 2024’ . … in that article we pointed readers at the main documents, and are also building up a growing list of external references to the AEMO’s publications (in the media and on social media etc). In this article, we’ll take a read through the ESOO itself, and highlight a number of things that jump out to us (some of which might drill further into later, in subsequent articles). (A) Switch-a-roo with the Scenarios A week ago today, Dan Lee wrote about ‘What the last twenty years of the ESOO tells us about blackout predictions’ … in terms of how some might use (and misuse?!) the projections being provided by AEMO. … that article’s received a fair number of compliments – so well worth a read, if you have not already done so. Some prior years have seemed like a royal flush for those playing ‘Blackout Bingo’ with news article headlines … whilst our early review of news headlines for the 2024 ESOO sees them much more subdued. We’ve been reflecting on some of the factors contributing to that more mellow perception and wonder if some of it has come about ‘simply’ because of how the AEMO has chosen to order the various scenarios it has modelled: ESOO Year The ‘Base Case’ Scenario The ‘Sensitivity’ Scenario(s) 2024 ESOO We’re collating articles here about the 2024 ESOO In this edition, the first scenario presented was called the ‘Federal and State Schemes sensitivity’ . This one assumes: ‘existing, committed and anticipated developments to meet the ESOO Central demand forecast, delivered to the schedules advised by developers , as well as: • Actionable transmission investments and forecast growth in coordinated CER and flexible demand resources. • Firming and some renewable energy developments that have specific funding, development or contracting arrangements under federal, state and territory government schemes and programs. ’ . As a result of the assumptions made, the Expected USE chart looks quite modest: — Perhaps some might think of this scenario as the ‘Everything Goes Smoothly Scenario’ . In this edition, the second scenario presented was called the ‘Committed and Anticipated Investments sensitivity’ . This one assumes: ‘existing, in commissioning, committed and anticipated generation, storage and transmission projects, according to AEMO’s commitment criteria, as well as committed investments in demand flexibility and consumer batteries that are coordinated to minimise investment needs in utility-scale solutions.’ … and also … ‘allowing for historically observed commissioning delays’ … the Expected USE chart looks quite different: — It’s worth noting that even this Scenario assumes the development of Anticipated projects … whilst in this recent article we illustrated how very different the situation might look on a NEM-wide basis looking at firming capacity if just assuming Committed (but not Anticipated) projects proceed. Compare/contrast that with the approach in prior years (below). 2023 ESOO We’re collating articles here about the 2023 ESOO For this year, the first scenario presented was called the ‘ESOO Central scenario’ , which assumed: ‘includes committed, in commissioning, and anticipated generation, storage and transmission projects, according to AEMO’s commitment criteria, as well as committed investments in demand flexibility and consumer batteries that are orchestrated to minimise grid requirements. Projects yet to reach final commissioning phases have been assumed to progress according to typical development, approval and commissioning timelines, which may be later than the dates advised by project developers’ … so there’s a significant differences to the assumptions made in the Base Scenario for the 2024 ESOO. In last year’s ESOO, the Expected USE chart was not as rosy as the one directly above: … but remember that the 2024 ESOO also contains dialled-down demand growth forecasts (and so on). In the prior year ESOO the second scenario presented was called the ‘Federal and state schemes sensitivity’ , which … ‘includes all developments in the ESOO Central scenario, delivered to the schedules advised by project developers, as well as : • Actionable transmission investments and forecast growth in consumer investments (orchestrated CER and DSP). • Firming and some renewable energy developments that have specific funding, development or contracting arrangements under federal, state and territory government schemes and programs.’ So, understandably, Figure 2 in that report showed a calmer outlook than Figure 1: Compare this to the scenario presented first in the 2024 ESOO … and which might gain most of the attention as a result? 2022 ESOO We’re collating articles here about the 2022 ESOO For this year, the first scenario presented was called the ‘ESOO Central scenario’ , which assumed: ‘… based on existing and committed developments only’ … so note that there’s no mention of ‘Anticipated’ developments being in this scenario (compared to the Base Scenario in the 2023 ESOO for the following year). With these assumptions made, the Expected USE chart was as follows: For this year, the second scenario presented was called the ‘ESOO Central outlook with anticipated and actionable developments’ , which assumed: ‘… an additional 3.4 GW of anticipated investments are in the pipeline and will improve the outlook if they progress as planned. ‘Anticipated’ developments are projects which meet some of AEMO’s commitment criteria, but not enough criteria to be considered committed. When generation and storage classed as anticipated in the ESOO is considered alongside the anticipated and actionable transmission developments identified in the 2022 ISP7 , based on current schedules, the reliability forecast improves significantly. ’ With these additional assumptions made, Figure 2 in the 2022 ESOO looks better than Figure 1: 2021 ESOO We’re collating articles here about the 2021 ESOO For this year, the first scenario presented was called the ‘ESOO Central outlook’ , which seems to take a similar approach as in this scenario in the 2022 ESOO (i.e. existing and committed developments only). With these assumptions made, the Expected USE chart was as follows: There was no second scenario presented in the Executive Summary of the 2021 ESOO. Reference to the ‘Years until a supply shortfall’ charts at the bottom of Dan’s article here will help readers understand why … i.e. the outlook in the 2021 ESOO was rosier than in the 2022 ESOO, and the 2023 ESOO (and now the 2024 ESOO). I suspect that there’s some judgement calls involved in this re-ordering of the scenarios in the 2024 ESOO, but don’t know the details. (B) Two focal points in time Looking specifically at the 2024 ESOO (and the ‘Committed and Anticipated Investments sensitivity’ scenario, which I’d still think of as the ‘Base Case’) there’s two particular focal points in time: B1) Summer 2024-25, which is imminent For summer 2024-25 there’s going to be a particular focus … as: 1) it’s only 3 months away by the calendar (or actually feels like it’s here already in QLD in the last week of winter ). 2) so there’s limited time for the AEMO to orchestrate responses. In the Executive Summary the AEMO wrote (p4): ‘AEMO will also take prudent action and seek to procure additional reserves for the coming 2024-25 summer, safeguarding consumers in a cost-appropriate manner’ … and ‘AEMO sought tenders from parties for out of market reserves in response to the May 2024 Update to the ESOO, and will tender for reserves in response to this ESOO.’ 3) But it’s worth noting the following, also in the Executive Summary: ‘… the reliability of the NEM will rely primarily on on-time delivery of the new resources under development, and the continued availability and high performance of the existing generation fleet ’ … with the ‘high performance’ jumping out to me (not a surprise, given that we’d already reported separately that the performance of the coal fleet had improved markedly to 30th June 2024. Given the above, it was not a surprise that the AEMO tendered for Reserve Trader for South Australia for the coming summer 2024-25 later that same day: B2) Further out Further into the future, there are more options available. On p11, the AEMO wrote: ‘Where this 2024 ESOO reliability forecast identifies a forecast reliability gap for a region, AEMO must request the AER to consider making a reliability instrument under Chapter 4A of the NER (Retailer Reliability Obligation [RRO]). In this 2024 ESOO, the forecast reliability gaps above require AEMO to request the AER to consider making the following RRO instruments: • In New South Wales, a T-3 reliability instrument for 2027-28. • In Victoria, a T-3 reliability instrument for 2027-28.’ << what follows below – even moreso than above – is a work in progress, so please keep in mind! >> (C) Questions about the Supply Side assumptions In skimming through the ESOO on a first pass there are a number of questions that occur to me about the Supply Side (which will be explored in subsequent articles … time permitting). Here’s some quick notes: (C1) To what extent is their delineation of VRE and Firming? On Tuesday 27th August 2024 we wrote ‘(Update of) long-term trends of (the high points of) Aggregate Scheduled Target’ … with that metric being a reasonable guide to one aspect of the requirement for Firming Capacity (i.e. whose purpose is Capacity and Insurance) … separate from the supply of VRE (which is for Energy). More generally, we wonder about the delineation between all aspects of ‘ Anytime/Anywhere Energy ’ and the complementary ‘Keeping the Lights on Services’ . More to come, time permitting… (C2) What’s assumed for coal unit performance, moving forwards? On Monday 26th August 2024 we wrote ‘Coal-fired unit performance has improved markedly from the ‘dog year’ that was 2022’ . But a year earlier we’d noted that ‘The 2023 ESOO report shows coal unit EFOR is still a significant factor’ . So, in reading the 2024 ESOO I have been particularly interested to see what the AEMO’s assumed in terms of coal unit performance (and closure dates as well) moving forwards. Verging on falling into that rabbit hole through various linked documents, we prepared ‘What’s the 2024 ESOO assume, in terms of coal unit performance?’ as a linked article: (C3) Weather scenarios and VRE performance Given that we’ve just been through the 2024 Q2 wind drought (as the worst period since the 2017 Q2 wind drought ) I’m particularly interested to see how this plays out, in terms of weather years modelled in the scenarios More to come, time permitting… (D) Questions about the Demand Side assumptions Similarly, here’s some quick questions we’re looking to ascertain, about assumptions in relation to the demand side: (D1) Changes to macro assumptions on demand growth? In the Executive Summary it jumps out to me that (on p4) they write: ‘Several factors are driving the 2024 ESOO forecast to show an improved reliability outlook compared with the 2023 reports: • << four other factors have been removed >> • AEMO now projects lower growth in energy consumption and maximum demand for most NEM regions than was previously forecast. These forecasts continue to consider growth driven by the potential for electrification of household and businesses, the emergence of the hydrogen production industry, and forecast expansion of industrial facilities including the rapid development of data centres. The growth has, however, been moderated by lower electric vehicle (EV) and business consumption trends relative to 2023 forecasts. ’ So it’s understandable that I’d like to drill in further. More to come, time permitting… (D2) The future of Major Industrial Loads? Given how we’ve been serving Major Industrial Loads for ~20 years (including by this form of Demand Response , and our ongoing association with the EUAA ) we’re particularly interested to delve into what the AEMO assumes in terms of the future for major industrial loads More to come, time permitting… (D3) What’s assumed in terms of Data Centers? In the quick skim, to date, we’ve seen commentary in several places about Data Center load. Given that Dan Lee has been collating information about Data Centers in the NEM over this year with the objective (time permitting) of posting some analysis before the end of the year, we’ve compiled ‘What’s the 2024 ESOO say about Data Centres’ here: For More to come, time permitting… (D4) Price responsive demand In the detailed reviews of 2024 Q1 and 2024 Q2 (both recently released) we re-arranged Appendix 2 to provide a particular focus on what was observable in each quarter of price-responsive demand. Back a year ago we’d also written ‘With the 2023 ESOO report, some real head scratching about Demand Response!’ For these (and other) reasons we will be particularly interested in delving into what we can see about this in the 2024 ESOO. More to come, time permitting… (E) Questions on Network assumptions A couple years ago we flagged this specific challenge when covering ‘What’s next for market modelling’ as Key Observation #6 within GenInsights21 a few years ago now! … specifically we wrote (in 6.5) ‘Modelling System Normal is not enough’ . With respect to the 2023 ESOO we noted that ‘The 2023 ESOO report clarifies why the transmission model only includes ‘System Normal’ – and why it’s a simplification’ . Has the approach changed, since that time? This came to mind again when writing ‘Questions, and implications, about transmission system failure?’ in this article , in response to the transmission failure on 13th February 2024 . (F) More generally, about the model itself Last year we’d also written here about how ‘Modelling is (still) a Mug’s Game’ . We’ll be reviewing with interest to read from this perspective, as well.",

Readers here can access the report, and accompanying materials, as follows: The Report Other Materials You can download the 177-page PDF of the report here: There’s more information (including earlier copies of the ESOO) collated on this this AEMO subsite . 1) Amongst the materials is this two-page overview . 2) The AEMO is also hosting a webinar about the ESOO on Tuesday 3rd September 2024 ) with registration details here . With respect to this release of the ESOO, readers might like to note the following: (A) What AEMO notes about the report There’s a Media Release titled ‘Delivery of ongoing energy investments critical in the coming decade’ – in which the AEMO notes: ‘The report highlights that expected investments in new generation, storage and transmission must be delivered on time and in full to maintain a reliable supply of electricity to homes and businesses. This includes federal and state government schemes, supported generation projects, actionable transmission developments, the coordination of consumer energy resources, and additional demand flexibility. ’ However, for me, the key takeaway is what’s noted in the Executive Summary – as follows: ‘The main findings of this 2024 ESOO are: • If delivered on time and in full , then federal and state government programs providing additional renewable generation and dispatchable resources, actionable transmission developments, and coordination of forecast consumer energy resources (CER) would provide sufficient generation capacity to meet growing electricity demand within relevant reliability standards over most of the next 10 years. Timely delivery of these expected investments is critical. • AEMO also considers a development outlook that includes only energy supply infrastructure developments that meet AEMO’s commitment criteria . If further investment beyond current committed and anticipated projects is delayed or does not materialise, AEMO forecasts reliability gaps will exist over the coming years in some NEM regions. These gaps are smaller than those forecast in the May 2024 Update to the 2023 ESOO and the 2023 ESOO. In this sensitivity, reliability risks are forecast higher than the relevant reliability standard3 in: − Victoria from this coming summer , in 2027-28 and from 2028-29 after Yallourn Power Station is advised to retire. − New South Wales this coming summer , again in 2027-28 when Eraring Power Station is now advised to retire, and from 2031-32. − South Australia this coming summer , again in 2026-27 when Torrens Island B and Osborne Power Stations are advised to retire, and in 2033-34. • AEMO will request the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) to put an obligation on retailers and liable entities to enter sufficient contracts to cover their customers peak demand needs, through the retailer reliability obligation . AEMO will also take prudent action and seek to procure additional reserves for the coming 2024-25 summer, safeguarding consumers in a cost-appropriate manner. • Alongside energy-related investments that support reliability, investments are also required to ensure that the power system remains stable and resilient. As existing synchronous generators retire, there is a need for system strength services across the NEM and for urgent implementation of the recently published National CER Roadmap.’ So how readers interpret this might depend, at least in part, on whether seeing ‘glass half full’ or ‘glass half empty’. (B) What we have noted on WattClarity®, about the ESOO Here on WattClarity ®: 1) Prior to the release of the ESOO we have posted: (a) At this point, worth reminding readers of the question ‘what is the purpose of the ESOO?’ we posed in GenInsights21 ; (b) A week ago today, Dan Lee wrote about ‘What the last twenty years of the ESOO tells us about blackout predictions’ … in terms of the report being a ‘blackout barometer’ . (c) Following our recent release of the GenInsights Quarterly Updates for 2024 Q2 , we shared three snippets – each of which included some questions about what we might hope to see in the ESOO: i. As the first excerpt, later in the day on Monday 26th August 2024 we wrote ‘Coal-fired unit performance has improved markedly from the ‘dog year’ that was 2022’ ii. As the second excerpt, on Tuesday 27th August 2024 we wrote ‘(Update of) long-term trends of (the high points of) Aggregate Scheduled Target’ . iii. As the third excerpt, on Wednesday 28th August 2024 we wrote ‘Are we *still* not building enough replacement Firming Capacity?’ .. 2) Following the release of the ESOO we have posted: (a) This article, obviously (b) Later on Thursday we published ‘Once through the ESOO (for 2024)’ … and are progressively filling in the blanks with more detailed articles: i. First ‘What’s the 2024 ESOO assume, in terms of coal unit performance?’ . ii. Then ‘AEMO calls for tenders for supply of RERT (in South Australia) for summer 2024-25’ . iii. Plus more to come in the next day or two… (C) News Media commentary about the ESOO 2024 So far today I have come across commentary in a range of places, including the following: 1) In the AFR we have seen… (a) Top of Front Page of the AFR, Angela MacDonald-Smith and Ben Potter write ‘Pressure on power grid eases as EV uptake falters’ – noting the online title is slightly different than shown here: (b) The next morning on p5 of the print edition we see Angela Macdonald Smith writing ‘Power market beginning to fail, energy users say’ – quoting Andrew Richards from the EUAA amongst others … the EUAA’s statement is linked further below (c) Perhaps more? 2) In the Australian we have seen … (a) Front Page we see Colin Packham that ‘Labor takes power walk on decade-long tightrope, Australian Energy Market Operator warns’ … again the online title slightly different than in print: (b) Graham Lloyd wrote ‘Power planning on a wing and a prayer’ . (c) Yesterday, leading into the publication of the ESOO, Colin Packham had written ‘AEMO warns contingency plans needed to avoid outages during energy transition’ . That’s all I can see at this point… 3) In the Guardian we have seen … (a) Adam Morton wrote ‘Australia’s electricity grid to remain reliable if renewable projects delivered ‘on time and in full’, Aemo says’ . That’s all I can see at this point. 4) In SMH and the Age we have seen … (a) Mike Foley wrote ‘Three months to back up the grid as risk of summer blackouts ramps up’ . That’s all we’ve found at this point. 5) In RenewEconomy we have seen … (a) On Thu 29th Aug, Sophie Vorrath wrote ‘New solar, wind and battery boosts reliability outlook, but AEMO says no room for more delay’ . (b) On Fri 30th Aug, Sophie Vorrath wrote ‘Households will produce more energy than they consume by 2040, and AEMO is paying attention’ . That’s all we’ve found at this point 6) In PV Magazine we have seen … (a) Nothing at this point. 7) In the ABC we have seen … (a) Daniel Mercer wrote ‘Summer blackout threat eases but AEMO warns risks remain as coal, gas plants retire’ . … incidentally, in this article Daniel Mercer quotes from Dan Lee’s earlier article on WattClarity about the ESOO as a ‘blackout barometer’ . Have not seen anything else, at this point. 8) On Sky News we have seen … (a) Max Melzer wrote ‘AEMO warns ‘any delay’ to energy projects could cause major blackouts, with NSW, Victoria and South Australia at greatest risk’ . Have not seen anything else, at this point. 9) On Bloomberg we have seen … (a) Rob Verdonck wrote ‘Australian Grid Sees Lower Risk of Power Crunch in Next Decade’ . Have not seen anything else, at this point. 10) On Ecogeneration we have seen … (a) Zihan (Fred) Zhang wrote ‘Renewables soar whilst industry demands more’ . Have not seen anything else, at this point. As a reader here, if you come across any other useful commentary, feel free to add as a comment below. (D) Commentary about the ESOO 2024 from Industry Organisations So far today I have come across commentary in a range of places, including the following: 1) From the Energy Users Association of Australia (EUAA) … (a) Noting that Andrew Richards (CEO) was quoted in the AFR article noted above, we see his comment here on LinkedIn on Thursday 29th August 2024;. (b) That comment linked through to the statement ‘ESOO Shows An Improved Outlook, But We Are Running Out Of Wriggle Room’ on their website. 2) From the Australian Energy Council (AEC) … (a) We’ve not had time to look yet…. 3) From the Clean Energy Council (CEC) … (a) We’ve not had time to look yet…. 4) From the Smart Energy Council (SEC) … (a) We’ve not had time to look yet…. 5) From the Energy Networks Association (ENA) … (a) We’ve not had time to look yet…. 6) From the Climate Council … (a) We saw the release ‘Look Mum, we’re actually doing it! AEMO confirms clean energy is powering up the grid’ . (E) Across the highpoints on Social Media If we see anything (that we think is) particularly insightful on Social Media (and we have the time!) we’ll look to note it here: 1) In this LinkedIn comment here , Alison Reeve (from Grattan Institute) points to the article ‘Wondering what to make of warnings about our electricity system? The outlook is improving – but we’re not out of the woods’ she wrote on the Conversation; 2) Nothing else yet …",

That’s some impressive wind speeds, and outputs!",

    "title": "Are we *still* not building enough replacement Firming Capacity?",
    "date": "28-08-2024 01:09:00 PM",
    "content": "Back on 14th May 2023 we wrote the article ‘We’re not building enough replacement dispatchable capacity’ . 1) That article ran in parallel with the completion of GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q1 and gave a sneak peak of some of the analysis included in that report. 2) In that article: (a) We included a long-term trend of annual peak requirement for firming capacity …. but note that just yesterday we posted ‘(Update of) long-term trends of (the high points of) Aggregate Scheduled Target’ to provide an updated view of this requirement (b) From the (not yet released) review of 2023 Q1 , we posted two ‘waterfall diagrams’ looking at changing amount of installed capacity on a NEMwide basis since the start of 2017 (i.e. just prior to the closure of Hazelwood ): i. In the first diagram we extended out into early 2023, so as to show the impact of the looming closure of Liddell units 1, 2 and 4 (as absolute megawatt (MW)); ii. In the second diagram we translate these changes to relative terms (i.e. based on 100% capacity starting at the start of 2017). Preceding the article above, the Federal Government had announced the creation of the Capacity Investment Scheme … which was (at that time) fully focused on provision of Firming Capacity. 1) about a year after the commencement (on 23rd November 2023) the Federal Government announced the expansion of the scheme ; 2) but it’s important for readers to note that: (a) the vast majority of the headline expansion of the scheme (i.e. from 6GW to 32GW in installed capacity) was focused on providing another mechanism for VRE; (b) whereas the expansion of support for Firming Capacity was much more modest than might have been inferred by some stakeholders (i.e. only 6GW to 9GW increase in support). 3) There are other thoughts by several authors posted about the Capacity Investment Scheme collated here . (A) An updated ‘Waterfall Chart’ of installed Firming Capacity In each edition of Appendix 4 within GenInsights Quarterly Updates we have updated the waterfall diagrams (i.e. absolute and relative) noted above, in order to give clients an updated view. Given that over a year has elapsed* since posting the article above (hence 5 updates to GenInsights Quarterly Updates under the bridge), we thought it might be time to share some updates to these charts * and, under the water, various energy sector ‘ducks’ have been paddling like crazy to progress various developments of Firming Capacity (A1) Change in installed Firming Capacity to 30th June 2024 (in absolute terms) In this updated trend, we see we’re well past the closure of Liddell … and approaching 8 years past the closure of Hazelwood: As we see in the chart, with the ups and downs in the 7.5 years since the closure of Hazelwood, the current status is that we’re down ~2,000MW of firming capacity (i.e. more than what we lost when Hazelwood closed) as at 30th June 2024. (A2) Change in installed Firming Capacity to 30th June 2024 (in relative terms) In relative terms, we see that we’re down (over) 4% of the installed capacity base of Firming Capacity in the post Hazelwood world: (B) Looking forward to projected additions and withdrawals (three different perspectives!) In more recent editions of Appendix 4 within GenInsights Quarterly Updates we have extended these ‘waterfall diagrams’ into the future to take a look at where we’re projected to land – taking into account both: 1) Looming retirements of coal (and other thermal) assets; and 2) Additions of new forms of firming capacity. However, it’s important for readers to understand that there are (at least!) three different perspectives about what type of projects-in-development should be included in these forward projections. Through this article we hope readers will become more aware of the pros (and cons) of each of the following three perspectives … and some readers might like to suggest 4th and 5th perspectives in the comments below as well. Perspective 1 = that some might like to use Extending the projection out to the (new, delayed closure of Eraring date in 2027) we could (and indeed, some others will ) produce a chart looking like this: When presented with a view like this: 1) readers can clearly see a net increase of ~3,000MW of installed over 11 years (from 2017 to 2028); 2) so might conclude that everything’s hunky dory … or at least that we’re on the right track. However we’d issue a strong note of caution – including for reasons outlined below. Perspective 2 = isn’t it more realistic to just consider additions that are (fully) Committed? Keen eyed readers on the chart above will note that it includes (on the additions side) a number of different projects that have been named in various support mechanisms (such as in the Capacity Investment Scheme ) but which have not (yet?) met all of the AEMO’s criteria to be deemed (fully) Committed. 1) The AEMO uses the term ‘Anticipated’ for these projects 2) It’s been reported in other locations that there are phantom projects that have existed in spreadsheets for long periods of time: (a) which have some form of Government support established in principle (b) but with no sod being turned in the years that have followed. So we wonder what the projection above would look like if we excluded those (i.e. Anticipated, but not Committed) projects : Clearly there’s a difference between Perspective #1 (increase of ~3,000MW) and Perspective #2 (drop of ~500MW). That’s not to say that either perspective is ‘wrong’ … just hoping to illustrate that each projection could yield a different narrative (especially if it were to be handed down on a tablet from on high, passed around, and then viewed by a devotee two or three steps removed from the messiah). Perspective 3 = what assumption should be made about SIPS? But wait, there’s more… On 24th March 2024 we published ‘A focused look at operations at Victoria Big Battery (VBB) on Tuesday 13th February 2024’ , containing some key considerations: 1) In the article in which we showed how the Victorian Big Battery (which has a notional Maximum Capacity of 300MW) only exported a maximum of 55MW through the major disruption to the Victorian grid on 13th February 2024 . 2) To be clear, this happened even when AEMO was instructing Load Shedding (i.e. Actual LOR3 ) through periods of the afternoon. 3) The reason for this appears to be: (a) Not a lack of charge in the battery; but rather (b) Because the other (unused) capacity was specifically reserved for the purpose of a System Integrity Protection Scheme (i.e. SIPS ) 4) Readers should be crystal clear that they should definitely not infer from this that anyone associated with the battery did anything ‘wrong’! 5) Rather …: (a) I highlight this example to wonder what capacity should be assumed from a Reliability Perspective at any of the (growing) number of batteries across the NEM that are being built in part because of a large reservation of some capacity for different forms of SIPS? (b) Surely it would be logical (and prudent) to exclude (from the installed capacity of the battery) any share of that capacity specifically reserved for SIPS ? So that is what we have done in the chart below presented as Perspective #3 (i.e. layering on what we did in Perspective #2): … and what a big difference that makes! Compared to Perspective #1 (which suggests an increase of ~3,000MW) we see a reversal in Perspective #3 (a decline of ~2,500MW … or by more than we lost when Hazelwood closed). So would it be true to conclude that we’re still not building enough replacement Firming Capacity ? (C) Questions for later in the week… Tomorrow (on Thursday 29th August 2024) we expect that the AEMO will release its 2024 ESOO . Amongst the things we’ll be looking to understand when we plunge into the ESSO include: 1) The extent to which AEMO separates from its modelling the requirements for VRE (which is really about energy production) and Firming (which is about Capacity and Insurance)? 2) If Firming is separately discussed, what AEMO has to say about the level of requirement? 3) Specifically, which of the three perspectives is closest to what the AEMO promotes as the ‘base case’ view of the future development of Firming Capacity?",

    "content": "Last week we released GenInsights Quarterly Updates for 2024 Q2 … this followed form our belated release of the same for 2024 Q1 . In that article I noted that we’d look to share a couple excerpts. Yesterday we posted the first excerpt , in the form of ‘Coal-fired unit performance has improved markedly from the ‘dog year’ that was 2022’ . Today we’re going to include a second excerpt from the broader analysis of ‘Aggregate Scheduled Target’ ( AggSchedTarget ) … which is 1) a metric we’ve been tracking in the GenInsights Quarterly Updates series of reports is series of report. 2) and is a good proxy for the requirement for Firming Capacity to complement the growing contribution of VRE. (A) Prior discussion about Aggregate Scheduled Target This metric was first introduced in Appendix 15 within GenInsights21 … with analysis then continued into GenInsights Quarterly Updates (in Appendix 4 therein). Here on WattClarity, you will find articles utilising this metric: 1) Collated under the ‘Requirement for Firming Capacity’ . category; and or 2) Tagged with any of the following: (a) AggSchedTarget ; and/or (b) ‘ Aggregate Scheduled Target ‘; or occasionally (c) ‘ Demand met by fully dispatchable supply ‘ … these articles include a growing number of Case Studies. (B) Recent statistics, from our Q1 and Q2 Quarterly Updates With that background out of the way, let’s look at some recent results … (B1) Looking at absolute Aggregate Scheduled Target In this article we’ll specifically focus on one particular permutation of the AggSchedTarget metric: 1) That being the absolute level across a dispatch interval of the Target for all Scheduled units. … noting that we’re deliberately focused on a NEM-wide measure so we can ignore any rabbit hole pertaining to inter-regional transfers (and/or transfer capability). 2) And, indeed, we’ll only focus on the high points in this article. (B1A) Results for the 2024 half-year Extracting from our detailed reviews for 2024 Q1 and 2024 Q2 , we’ll start with these trends of daily headline statistics for each of the quarters in focus for those reviews: Daily Results through 2024 Q1 Here’s one of the charts published in our review of 2024 Q1 showing the daily headline statistics: With respect to the days noted above: 1) We’d previously posted ‘Case Study of NEM-wide Aggregate Scheduled Target on Thursday 18th January 2024’ – noting that: (a) That day’s not really a standout in the chart above; and that (b) The reason for that article was a large 5-minute ramp in AggSchedTarget. 2) Noting that Sunday 4th February contained the highest point in the quarter (albeit below 30,000MW) it’s worth noting the prior article ‘Case Study of NEM-wide Aggregate Scheduled Target in early February 2024’ that included reference to: (a) The article ‘NEM-wide ‘Market Demand’ reached 32,938MW on Sunday 4th Feb 2024 (updated)’ ; and also (b) This ‘Brief Case Study of Sunday 4th February 2024, with low IRPM following high Market Demand’ . Daily Results through 2024 Q1 Here’s the same chart for 2024 Q2 : Noting the highest points in the quarter occurred in June, it’s worth pointing back to some particular days – such as: 1) In the first full week: (a) Tuesday 4th June 2024 ; 2) In the second week: (a) Wednesday 12th June 2024; 3) In the third week: (a) Monday 17th June 2024 ; (b) Tuesday 18th June 2024 ; (c) Wednesday 19th June 2024 ; and (d) In particular Thursday 20th June 2024 (given it saw the highest point in the quarter … and the 2024 year to date). Readers will understand that there were several factors driving this, including three big ones: 1) Cold weather driving higher Underlying Demand ; coupled with 2) Winter evening peak in demand being after sunset; and (through 2024 Q2 in particular) 3) Quite poor wind output through much of 2024 Q2 . (B1B) Longer-term trend Noting that the highest point in the quarter was above 31,000MW (and indeed that several days saw maximum points above 30,000MW): 1) it’s worth referring back to the longer-term trend for these statistics that was published in the article ‘We’re not building enough replacement dispatchable capacity’ (i.e. firming) . 2) But remember that (at that time) results had only been compiled till the end of 2023 Q1 . Here’s the updated trend, now with results for another 5 quarters added on: In this chart we’ve drawn a box around the high points across each of the past 13 years to highlight that they are all quite similar … especially considering that we’ve added a large amount (well past 40GW?) of VRE plant over a similar time range (with ~22GW of Large Scale and more than 20GW of rooftop PV). As noted on the image, there’s a few headline observations that can be drawn: 1) At the bottom end (in blue) the annual minimum points for AggSchedTarget has been dropping sharply (by ~1,000MW each year) in recent years; 2) For the medium and average points , they have also been dropping since 2009 (a) which speaks to the ‘area under the curve’ (i.e. the volume of energy required to be generated by this firming capacity) (b) hence economic challenges for assets that are high capex and low opex … such as: i. pre-existing (and formerly ‘baseload’) coal fired generation – which are increasingly economically challenged ( even if their technical performance has improved markedly in the past 18 months). ii. also for possible deployment of new options (such as nuclear), if we were to assume that they’d continue running in the same challenged way that coal units need to run (though I won’t fall further into that rabbit hole). (c) the top points (i.e. annual maximum points), however, continue to reinforce that we require firming plant with available/unconstrained capacity (i.e. not just installed capacity) roughly greater than the peak demand seen in the grid in a given year. (B1C) Count of high points per year To help the subscribers to the GenInsights Quarterly Updates form a fuller picture of requirement, we’ve also been adding in these trended duration plots, which count the number of dispatch intervals in each year seeing AggSchedTarget greater than 30GW : We can see in this trend that the past 13 years (again highlighted) has seen roughly equivalent number of dispatch intervals of very high requirement for firming capacity . … This is important to note – especially given that: 1) 2024 ytd is only spanning 6 months 2) yet has seen more dispatch intervals than 2021, 2022 and 2023 (and also more than some earlier years as well) Taking a step further and adding in the count of dispatch intervals with AggSchedTarget above 27,000MW we see the following: With only half of the 2024 year counted in the stats above we see that the count is: 1) Larger than for full year 2021 and 2023 (which were La Nina affected) 2) Almost as large as fully year 2022 3) Suggestive that the full year results might be greater than for full year 2020. Readers should note that 1,000 dispatch intervals equates to ~83 hours, or 3.5 days (if consecutive) … just less than 1% of the year (so not a large period in which to earn a return on what would still be, from a grid perspective, a very necessary investment). (B2) Assessing ramp in Aggregate Scheduled Target We don’t have time to cover this now … but it has been assessed previously in GenInsights21 and in each issue of the GenInsights Quarterly Updates (B3) Assessing predictability of Aggregate Scheduled Target We (also) don’t have time to cover this now … but this question has (also) been assessed previously in GenInsights21 and in each issue of the GenInsights Quarterly Updates (C) Questions for later in the week… In two days (on Thursday 29th August 2024) we expect that the AEMO will release its 2024 ESOO . Amongst the things we’ll be looking to understand will include: 1) The extent to which AEMO separates from its modelling the requirements for VRE (which is really about energy production) and Firming (which is about Capacity)? 2) If Firming is separately discussed, what AEMO has to say about the level of requirement?",

    "title": "Coal-fired unit performance has improved markedly from the ‘dog year’ that was 2022",
    "date": "26-08-2024 04:15:00 PM",
    "content": "Some readers will recall how we wrote ‘Unavailability of coal units hits 24% across calendar 2022 …’ on 6th March 2023 1) that article was one of the snippets shared from the 198-page GenInsights Quarterly Update for Q4 2022 . 2) readers will recall that poor coal unit performance was one of the significant factors contributing to the 2022 Energy Crisis . Last week we released GenInsights Quarterly Updates for 2024 Q2 … this followed form our belated release of the same for 2024 Q1 . In that article I noted that we’d look to share a couple excerpts (A) Aggregate unavailability has fallen significantly (i.e. an improvement) In the 18 months since the end of calendar 2022, the performance of the fleet of the 44 x remaining coal units has improved markedly … we can see this in the long-term trend of monthly aggregate unavailability of coal units (although some might say that this improvement has come off a low base): With respect to this chart … and also the table immediately below: (A1) Observations A couple key points in the above: 1) The main points are that: (a) At the end of 2022, the 12-month trailing performance (which hit 24%) was the worst performance recorded in the 20-year history; (b) In the 18 months since that time, it’s dropped sharply to be ~18% at the end of June 2024. (c) Though note that this is not the lowest it’s been over the ~20 year history (or even the lowest in the past 10 years). 2) But it’s also worth noting that this trailing measure of performance looks set to improve further through until mid 2025 (barring calamity with the units): (a) Because of the 12 month trailing nature of the metric; (b) This metric has not yet seen the roll-off of the effect of return to service at Callide C: i. With Callide unit C3 having come back online on 1st April (after 518 days offline) … and then just last week after it’s 21-day forced outage . ii. With Callide unit C4 slated to return to service within a week: … the snapshot of the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view shown in this article about Eraring earlier today shows expected return to service still being this coming Saturday 31st August 2024 . … after more than 3 years offline. (A2) Methodology Keep in mind that (with this chart, and the table below) several points on the methodology: 1) Older units that have since retired by this point in time (e.g. Hazelwood, Liddell and others) have been excluded from the analysis, in order to ensure the 20-year history shown above uses the same sample set: i.e. the 44 x ‘still operational’ coal units … which are: i. 22 x coal units in QLD ii. 12 x coal units in NSW iii. 10 x coal units in VIC 2) In all cases, we have used ‘Registered Capacity’ as the measure of a coal unit’s capacity: (a) For reasons explained here , it’s typically the ‘best’ measure for a coal unit’s capacity (not so much for wind and solar, for instance) (b) Though there are some exceptions, as you’ll see below. (B) It’s not a homogenous bunch! Too many people I see fall into a ‘trap’ in assuming that all coal units are similar, in terms of their performance … however as we’ve noted in the GenInsights Quarterly Updates series (and GenInsights21 before that), they are not a homogenous bunch . … some units are performing quite well (though it’s not often talked about) whilst other units are clearly quite challenged (much more commonly noted, including in articles here on WattClarity ). From the latest report, here are two extracts: B1) Twenty+ years of history Taking the same ‘unavailability’ data as used to produce the chart above, here’s a tabular view of a long run of history of annual unavailability (by calendar year) looking back to (part year) 2001: Data is aggregated to station … but keep in mind that, to save on table width, we’ve been bundling the 6 x supercritical units in QLD together through these reports. Remembering that the row for 2024 is only for a half-year (so the numbers are typically lower if there’s not been any planned outage performed on the units in this 6 month period), we see that performance for 2023 and 2024 ytd is mostly improved on 2022. We can (also) clearly see that these stations have quite different performance profiles : 1) Some (units and) stations have been performing quite well. 2) Some (units and) stations are longer in life and so (for this reason and perhaps others) are more challenged to operate. B2) The past 12 months A different extract from the report is this page, which shows a Gantt-chart style view of our internal derivation of a time range in which the unit’s been in one of three states: GREEN = Available, RED = on a (full) Forced Outage, GREY = a (full) Planned Outage: This chart spans the 12 month period to 30th June 2024. Note that this method has pre-dated the AEMO’s publication of upgraded MT PASA DUID Availability data from 9th October 2023 , so we have (at least to this point) persisted with the pre-existing automated method that looked deep in the bids to ascribe outages as ‘planned’ or ‘forced’. Hence the data won’t line up 100% with data shown in the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view (for instance): 1) It will be fairly close; 2) But it does not take into account Economic Outages (i.e. shown in turquoise in the widget) for instance. (C) Particularly highlighting some highlights and contrasts Some quick observations: 1) There are 8784 hours in the (leap) year – of the 44 units shown: (a) There are 32 units with Forced Outages lower than 10% of the year (i.e. less than 878 hours in red … glass half full) … of these, there were 14 units available more than 8,432 hours (i.e. more than 96% of the year no Forced or Planned Outages) (b) But this means there were 12 units with Forced Outages more than 10% of the year (glass half empty) 2) Also note some contrasts: (a) Have a look at the difference in performance between (well performing) Loy Yang B and (older and more challenged) Yallourn in Victoria (b) Similarly, keep an eye on the difference between the (well performing) Stanwell and the (older and more challenged) Gladstone in QLD. 3) I’ve also highlighted: (a) Callide C, because of the long outages (that are thankfully ended or ending); and (b) Eraring, given the recent extension decision . 4) No doubt you’ll make your own observations (D) Some things to watch out for, in the ESOO… As such, when the 2024 ESOO comes out later in the week, I’ll be interested to see: 1) Whether the EFOR (Equivalent Forced Outage Rate) for coal units has been adjusted from what was assumed in the 2023 ESOO … and, if so, how and why? 2) I’m also interested to see whether the AEMO continues with the approach taken in the past – in which it’s produced a common EFOR for all coal units in a region : (a) such as noted here for the 2023 ESOO (b) which, as we can see in the above, is a simplification … so those familiar with the Monte-Carlo processes used in modelling processes such as for the ESOO can think about how that might influence the results derived. That’s all for now…",

(A) Eraring unit 3 outage was planned well in advance Referring to the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view this afternoon, we see a broader picture for the 4 x Eraring units: We see that: 1) The return to service for Eraring unit 1 on Saturday (following unplanned outage) followed on from the return to service of Eraring unit 2 a couple days earlier (that unit had also been offline for a forced outage); 2) But in contrast, we see the outage for Eraring unit 3: (a) Was planned in advance (b) Is a lengthy one … with expected return to service not until 10th November 2024 (76 days away)! (B) But no other outages (yet?) planned for other units Given that it was only 23rd May 2024 (i.e. three months ago) that the decision was confirmed to extend the service life of Eraring station out until ‘at least’ August 2027, I wondered what plans had been made for planned outages for the Eraring units through 2026 and into 2027. Thankfully with the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view (looking at the MT PASA DUID Availability data, but filtered to just the Eraring station) we get a very rich view: Remember that this widget allows the user to ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to review ‘that other dimension of time’ As noted on the image, from the currently expected return to service date for ER03 through until the (new) closure date mooted for the station (August 2027) there’s no other outages currently planned . 1) I would surprised if that does not change in the coming months as the generator works through their plans to ensure the optimal unit performance through until the eventual closure . 2) Maybe they’ll wait until they see what’s there, when they open ER03 up in this outage? 3) As a further note (with reference to this later article ) see how ER02 and ER04 both had lengthy planned outages through the 12 months to 30th June 2024.",

    "content": "Way back we we published the GRC2018 we’d written about how ‘the NEM is becoming increasingly dependent on the weather’ . … that was Theme 6 within Part 2 of the 180-page analytical component . In the (growing!) years since that publication, what we’ve seen has continued to reinforce that notion. So readers will understand my interest in seeing this LinkedIn update from Anthony Cornelius by WeatherWatch : There are ‘polar cyclones’ !? … I learn something new each day. That update links through to the article ‘Damaging Winds & Gales for Southern Half of the Country, “Summer” & Elevated Bushfire Dangers in the North’ that provides a lot of context.

    "title": "What the last twenty years of the ESOO tells us about blackout predictions",
    "date": "22-08-2024 01:13:00 PM",
    "content": "The AEMO’s Electricity Statement Of Opportunities (ESOO) provides us with a detailed but nuanced look at demand, generation, and reliability projections for the decade ahead. With the 2024 edition scheduled to be published next week, I’ve undertaken a small project over the last two days to review the full history of the report. I’ve done this to share some insights into what has changed over the years, and what hasn’t. What has changed: the methodology and the purpose The ESOO has been published annually since the start of the NEM in 1998. Its original purpose was to inform market stakeholders about the adequacy of supply to meet demand in coming years – hence the ‘statement of opportunities’ moniker. Electronic versions from 2010 onwards can be found in the AEMO archives . We have a dusty collection of older physical copies on our bookshelves in the Global-Roam office. And conveniently, these older editions included a CD-ROM (which still work!) containing the spreadsheet model used for the reliability outlook projections. Top: The 2004 ESOO (then known as the SOO), back when it was packaged with a CD-ROM. Bottom: The 2004 ESOO supply-demand balance calculator spreadsheet. Source: Statement of Opportunities 2004, NEMMCO/AEMO. As you would expect, the ESOO modelling methodology has come a long way in twenty years. Amongst other complexities, the energy transition has necessitated the electricity system to: 1) have a greater dependency on weather, and 2) be designed to handle a wider range of contingency events. These new realities forced the AEMO to move from deterministic modelling, towards probabilistic methods in the mid-2010s. The current methodology is based on time-sequential modelling over each financial year at a 1-hour granularity, using Monte Carlo simulations of security-constrained optimal dispatch. The results from these simulations are probability-weighted and assessed against the reliability standard. The reliability standard in the NEM has always been 99.998%. Simply stated, this means that only 0.002% of demand should be allowed to be unserved by supply each financial year (the equivalent of roughly 10.5 minutes of outages for the average consumer). However, two policy developments in the late-2010s moved the goalposts, and muddied the purpose of the ESOO : In October 2018, the since-disbanded COAG agreed to implement the Retailer Reliability Obligation (RRO). Read Ben Skinner’s excellent summary here if you want to understand all of the gory details of what it is, how it came to be, and the compliance obligations it entails. In November 2019, the since-disbanded Energy Security Board recommended energy ministers introduce the Interim Reliability Measure (IRM) – a much stricter threshold for unserved energy, of 0.0006%. This then became a trigger for the RRO in place of the original reliability standard. These two changes meant that the results from the reliability outlook became even more sensitive, and began to act as an initiator for real-world compliance obligations. And finally, it’s also worth noting the increasing use of the RERT mechanism over a similar timeframe. Last year we saw RERT tenders initiated almost immediately after the release of the ESOO . What hasn’t changed: mis-forecasts and modelled supply shortfalls There are a few common threads that have become apparent to me from skimming through 20+ editions of the ESOO over the last couple of days. Firstly, it is clear that demand has been significantly over-forecasted in some historical instances and (albeit less frequently) under-forecasted in others. I would argue that these prior mis-forecasts are less to do with a lack model sophistication, and more to do with the input assumptions regarding the underlying drivers, made up of: Under-predicted factors (i.e. not always anticipated, but did eventuate) – such as the uptake of rooftop solar, increasing energy efficiency, an LNG industry in Queensland, the timing of Hazelwood’s closure, etc. Over-predicted factors (i.e. anticipated, but did not eventuate) – such as policy continuity, a long-term emissions trading scheme, the timing of Eraring’s closure, etc. SA and VIC were modelled as one region in the 2004 ESOO, with the reliability outlook showing supply shortfalls for 9 of the 10 years ahead. Source: Statement of Opportunities 2004, NEMMCO/AEMO. With the benefit of hindsight, the demand forecast for QLD from the 2011 ESOO overshot the mark. The QLD maximum demand record was most recently broken in January 2024 , landing closer to 11,000 MW. Source: Statement of Opportunities 2011, AEMO. The 2022 ESOO’s reliability outlook raised some alarm bells, and was prior to the announcement of Eraring’s extension. Source: Electricity Statement of Opportunities 2022, AEMO. So all models are wrong, but some are useful… that’s probably not particularly enlightening for long-time readers of our blog . My second and more important observation is that the ESOO has a long history of projecting supply shortfalls. The first image in the series of three above illustrates that this was true even two decades ago. And despite these projections, the NEM has, largely, maintained high levels of reliability since inception. So does that mean that the AEMO are really awful at forecasting, and always have been? No. The report is meant to inform the market, so it is an intentional feedback loop. If it does that, then it has achieved its primary purpose – even if that means that what then unfolds is different than the forecast. This in itself therefore almost guarantees that the reliability outlook will be ‘inaccurate’. So then, how has the ESOO faired as a blackout barometer? Somehow the release of the ESOO has triggered an annual tradition of journalists and social media commentators misinterpreting its results as a ‘blackout predictor’ of sorts. It is a tradition that is almost as old as the ESOO itself. A collage of headlines about the ESOO that we’ve seen in recent years. Sources: ABC, Financial Review, The Guardian, The Australian, Sydney Morning Herald. If you were to believe that modelled supply shortfalls = incoming blackouts, then you might have already burned through your candle supply waiting in vain. In the next five charts I display the number of years until a supply shortfall for each region – based on the central/neutral/medium reliability outlook in each ESOO over the past twenty years. Years until a modelled supply shortfall in each of the ESOO’s reliability outlooks over the past two decades. Source: NEMMCO/AEMO And now for reference, below is the most recent data that I could find showing actual unserved energy levels in the NEM over a similar time range. Actual Unserved Energy between FY 2006 and 2022 . Source: Reliability Panel Annual Market Performance Review , March 2023 The caveat to keep in mind here though is that the ESOO is not the only lever that the AEMO can pull to manage reliability. In any case, the link between blackouts and the NEM’s reliability standard being breached is a bit of a silly oversimplification in the first place. As others such as Dylan McConnell have written about, distribution-level outages are a much greater source of blackout incidences for the everyday electricity consumer. Key Takeaways It is not a recent phenomenon that the ESOO has projected supply shortfalls, and yet we’ve seen very few historically. There should be some lessons from this, so I’ll finish with two key points: Like many of the AEMO’s forecasts, the reliability outlook is intended to elicit a market response. The accuracy of a rain forecast is independent of whether you decide to bring an umbrella when you leave the house. Forecasts like the reliability outlook in the ESOO are not divorced from the outcome in such a way. This is an important reason why we always need to think about that other dimension of time . And further, it’s in the AEMO’s self-interest to avoid a supply shortfall . That’s one of the main reasons why the AEMO exists – and you can bet good money that they will shoulder the blame if a supply shortfall eventuates. To quote a former NSW premier “Always back the horse called self-interest, because you’ll at least know it’s always trying” . My intention here is not to downplay the urgent and obvious need for new supply, but rather to highlight that the ESOO holds up as a very poor leading indicator of blackouts… despite what the mainstream media and social media commentators might try to imply.",

(b) On 1st April 2024, Callide C3 returned to service after 518 days offline 2) More recent, shorter outage: (a) Once online, the unit then ran through 2024 Q2 . (b) Unfortunately we saw that the unit came offline Friday 26th July 2024 (almost 4 weeks ago). (c) On 31st July we wrote ‘Callide C3 offline until expected return to service on Monday 26th August 2024’ .

    "date": "21-08-2024 07:59:00 PM",
    "content": "Reader Beware … just because you’re reading more about coal unit outages here in recent days, it does not necessarily mean that these outages are happening more frequently! ———————- Yesterday evening we wrote the quick article ’Unplanned outage at Loy Yang A1 ’ after we noticed that LYA1 unit had come offline via the ‘Notification’ widget alert in ez2view . This morning we noted the unit was still offline, and so wrote ‘Using the ‘Next Day Public’ data set to see more about yesterday evening’s unplanned outage at Loy Yang A1 (which remains offline at this point)’ … but ran out of time. So in this 3rd article in a series, we take a look at the evolution of bidding at Loy Yang A1 utilising the ‘Next Day Public’ data set and the ‘Bid Explorer’ widget in ez2view . (A) Quick notes for ez2view users For those ez2view users who are following along with their own copies, some quick clarification might help: The ‘Bids & Offers’ Widget in ez2view The ‘Bid Explorer’ Widget in ez2view For readers here on WattClarity, the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view is the one we’ve almost always shown in articles here … so it’s probably the one you’re most familiar with. This widget provides a concatenated view of the ‘as used in dispatch’ bids across the filtered list of units (i.e. so compiled across however many bids and rebids were submitted by those units). In contrast, the ‘Bid Explorer’ widget has been hardly used in articles on WattClarity (which is part of the reason to utilise it here, for a change). This widget is intended to help users watch the evolution of a bid for a single DUID … such as with Loy Yang A1 in this article. With respect to both widgets: 1) Remember that all bids for all units are shown ‘at the RRN’ (i.e. not ‘at the Station gate’) in order to allow for comparability across units and stations. 2) Licensed users should remember to use the ‘?’ buttons on the top right of each widget to access more (version specific) explanation. 3) For those not so familiar with the specifics of the NEM, recall that the Price Bands in bids are set at ‘ Gate Closure #1 ’ the prior day, but that volumes can be shifted in these bancs (subject to rebid rules and the AER Rebid Guidelines ) any time up until ‘ Gate Closure #2 ’ for each individual dispatch interval. If clients have questions about the above, feel free to contact us directly via the usual means. (B) Progressive evolution of bids at Loy Yang A1 With the above in mind, let’s look through what happened (with respect to this unit in the bids) through the day… Rebid received by AEMO at 14:20 the prior day The first bid selected in this widget was submitted at 14:20 the day before (i.e. Monday 19th August 2024 ), and was used until the 05:55 dispatch interval: As we see here, the bid showed the intent to operate fairly consistently across the day (at that point). Rebid received by AEMO at 05:48 on the day The first rebid on Tuesday 20th August 2024 was received by the AEMO at 05:48 and so first used in the dispatch interval ending 05:55 dispatch interval: As noted on the image, this rebid pertained to AEMO forecast prices (hence the ‘A’ used in the rebidding category as per the AER Rebid Guidelines ) … for the early period we see some volume shifted from higher prices (green colours) down to $0/MWh. Rebid received by AEMO at 13:59 on the day The second rebid on Tuesday 20th August 2024 was received by the AEMO at 13:59 … and ended up only being used by NEMDE for 6 dispatch intervals (though the generator, the AEMO and the broader market did not know that at that time): Rebid received by AEMO at 14:29 on the day The bid above only lasts (i.e. as ‘current’) for 30 minutes because the third rebid on Tuesday 20th August 2024 was received by the AEMO at 14:29 … so is first used at 14:35: We see the outage is brought forward, with the rebid reason referencing (some) ‘auxiliary plant failure’ . Though it was not visible to us in real time, this rebid suggests some time might need to be taken to rectify the failure (to whatever piece of auxiliary plant is referenced) before the unit returns to service. Rebid received by AEMO at 15:52 on the day The bid above only is superseded by the fourth rebid on Tuesday 20th August 2024 that is received by the AEMO at 15:52 … but this one is even-more-quickly superseded: Rebid received by AEMO at 15:57 on the day In contrast to the above, this fifth rebid on Tuesday 20th August 2024 (submitted at 15:57) lasts two dispatch intervals: It shows a more rapid drop in availability. Rebid received by AEMO at 16:07 on the day The sixth and final rebid on Tuesday 20th August 2024 (submitted at 16:07) slightly adjusts availability in the last non-zero dispatch interval in the bid: As noted in the first article , the unit was offline prior to 16:20. That’s all I have time for now …",

This morning we noted the unit was still offline, so I’ve waited until after 09:00 to post this follow-on article… (but have not much time) (A) Using the ‘Generator Outages’ widget Utilising the ‘Generator Outages’ widget , which has updated for the MT PASA DUID Availability data set update that the AEMO published just after 09:00 this morning, we get a first glimpse (at least in this data set) of what the generator suggests might be the return-to-service expectation: I’ve annotated the image to indicate that some of the data is ‘stale’, as it’s fallen outside of the stipulated time horizon for MT PASA data updates. … for those licensed ez2view users playing along themselves, remember that the ‘?’ button in the top right of the widget links to detailed online help for this widget.

    "title": "Millmerran unit 2 offline on unplanned outage – Wednesday 21st August 2024",
    "date": "21-08-2024 10:08:00 AM",
    "content": "Reader Beware … just because you’re reading more about coal unit outages here in recent days, it does not necessarily mean that these outages are happening more frequently! ———————- As noted in yesterday evening’s article about the unplanned outage at Loy Yang A1 (more on that later, time permitting), we have several reasons to be publishing a series of these ‘coal unit outage’ articles in recent days … not the least of which are to help several ez2view clients to understand how to do this type of alerting and analysis themselves. This morning we noticed that Millmerran Unit 2 came offline … again through our ‘any coal unit switches off’ configured alert in the Notifications widget in ez2view that handily sends a few of us an email: Worth noting in this article that this alert was triggered by ez2view at ~08:31 … so just at the end of the 08:30 dispatch interval when AEMO does the ‘SCADA snapshot’ process to produce what’s alternatively called: FinalMW for 08:30 InitialMW for 08:35 What this means is that the know the unit was offline by ~08:29:40 (i.e. when the ‘SCADA snapshot’ process was run … more on that in a subsequent article). Briefly, let’s look at a couple other data sets… (A) Unit Dashboard widget In the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view, we see the following display: (B) Not a planned outage Note that I have not included a snapshot of the ‘Generator Outages’ widget here … that’s: 1) Because it’s going to look largely the same as it did at the time of yesterday evening’s article ; 2) Which happens because the MT PASA DUID Availability data set is only updated several times through ‘sunlight hours’ 6 days per week (i.e. shortly after 09:00, 12:00, 15:00 and 18:00) … and so, at the time of the coal unit outage, there’d been no update since yesterday, and the image there showed no planned outage in the next couple weeks. (C) Wait till 04:00 tomorrow for rebid reasons Likewise, we need to wait until after 04:00 tomorrow for the ‘Next Day Public’ data dump that would help indicate how the generator responds as the unit trips … which (e.g. in the rebid reasons) might give some clues as to why the unit has come offline. So no value in looking too much at the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget yet. (D) Mainland Frequency What we can do is include this snapshot of System Frequency on the mainland, which shows a smaller drop in frequency compared to here for LYA4 on Wed 14th Aug and TNPS1 on Mon 19th Aug (in part because of a smaller size instantaneous reduction): Similar (but not quite the same) as yesterday, the frequency recovery will presumably have been because of Primary Frequency Response augmenting Regulation FCAS (though perhaps not Contingency Raise FCAS in this case).",

    "content": "Reader Beware … just because you’re reading more about coal unit outages here in recent days, it does not necessarily mean that these outages are happening more frequently! ———————- We’re having parallel conversations with several of our clients (each who have a licence to ez2view ) with respect to using the software to alert on, and then interpret, coal unit outages … which are topical for obvious reasons: 1) so it suits our purposes to share this type of article here (rather than duplicate information in parallel one-on-one conversations); 2) as we have also recently for: (a) This trip and (brief) unplanned outage at Loy Yang A4 on Wednesday 14th August 2024 … not noted in that article was that the unit was back online a couple hours later. (b) About the ‘Wobbles in recent days, at Loy Yang A’ ; and (c) Yesterday evening the trip and (brief) unplanned outage at Tarong North on Monday 19th August 2024 … not noted in that article is that the unit was back online soon after. (A) Broader aspects of coal unit performance All of these events feed into a broader conversation about coal unit performance. On that note: 1) Next week (time permitting) we’ll post some insights generated from our recent reviews of 2024 Q1 and 2024 Q2 . 2) Also next week we’ll be curious to see what the AEMO reports in the 2024 ESOO . (B) Outage today at Loy Yang A1 (current visibility) So adding to the list above, Loy Yang A1 came offline this afternoon, as captured in this ‘Notifications’ alert from a display copy of ez2view we have running: Different from the other two cases we documented recently (links above), we note that this unit has come offline from a lower load position – which makes us wonder if this outage was planned in advance? … unit trips from close to full load are highly likely to be unplanned outages As is our standard process to quickly understand if the outage was planned or unplanned, we flip to the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view to the pre-filtered view of MT PASA DUID Availability data for all 44 x coal units remaining in the NEM: As was the case for Tarong North yesterday, we see that this outage has appeared ‘out of the blue (green)’ … from which we are confident to infer that it’s not an outage that was planned in advance (despite the unit coming off from low load). Out of curiosity, I’ve clicked through to the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view to see a time-series of the output profile of the unit (looking back 2 days) and, up until 04:00 this morning, how the unit had been bidding: I’ve also selected the 04:00 dispatch interval in the chart to see (in the table) the most recent bidding information … which talked about commercial factors in the market (i.e. and did not hint at any technical issues in that particular rebid reason ). (C) Impact on System Frequency In the past two examples (trip from close to full load) we saw frequency drop outside of the NOFB , which will presumably have triggered Contingency Raise FCAS response to augment the Primary Frequency Response and the Regulation FCAS to help the frequency recover. A quick reference to our live and high speed dashboard shows not the same level of dip in the past 2 hours (which is what we would expect , with a disturbance considerably smaller in size). (D) If we wanted to delve further… For those readers following on with their own copies of ez2view … then I might suggest some of the following: 1) We hope you’ve already configured your own companion notification alert to email operations@YourCompanyDomain when any [Coal Unit] Switches ON (a) i.e. the inverse of what was triggered above. (b) that will let you know if Loy Yang A1 makes it back online this evening. 2) We’re running out of daylight hours (i.e. fitting in with the cadence of the MT PASA DUID Availability data updates), but the last update today (i.e. 18:00 today) might contain updated details on outage plans for Loy Yang A1… (a) i.e. if it turns out there’s some technical issue meaning that the generator can’t bring the unit straight back on; (b) Given how late in the day it is, however, the generator may not have time to make that assessment to publish the data to AEMO and hence into the data update for 18:00 … (c) So more likely that any update won’t be seen until the update for 09:00 tomorrow. 3) Also tomorrow (after the ‘Next Day Public’ data drop after 04:00) we’d be able to drill into the rebid reasons (e.g. in the ‘Bids Table’ within the ‘ Bids & offers ’ widget in ez2view ) to see what AGL has nominated as the reason for the outage there. 4) If the outage was planned in advance, the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget might be useful for reviewing successive updates of the MT PASA DUID Availability data set to see how outage plans have shifted around. (a) for instance, in January 2024 we posted ‘Hot & Wet Weather pushes back expected return to service dates for Callide C3 and Callide C4’ utilising this widget to show changes for Callide C3 and Callide C4 . (b) however as there’s no outage currently pencilled in via MT PASA DUID Availability for this unit, this approach is not really relevant at present for Loy Yang A1 … other than to show that there’s currently no outage planned for the unit until April 2025: … remembering that this widget allows the user to ‘ look up a vertical ’ to ‘see that other dimension of time ’, we see that the 2-week long planned outage has recently been shifted back a couple weeks in the schedule, for reasons unknown (though not concerning, as this type of shuffling is quite common).",

Finally, here’s a snapshot of the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view for the 18:35 dispatch interval filtered down to just the coal units (noting some VIC units are over the page fold). With respect to this view, we see both: 1) Clearly that the unit does not have a planned outage in the immediate future: … so we deduce that this unit outage is ‘out of the blue green’ (pardon the pun) and so is a forced outage , of duration unknown at this point (a) maybe it’s just tripped … in which case it could be back online within a short space of time. (b) or maybe there’s some technical fault arisen, which might mean the unit needs to be off for a while to rectify. (c) either way, remember that Hugh Saddler wrote ‘power station trips are normal … ’ back in 2018. 2) Perhaps not quite so obvious is: (a) how the unit’s availability in recent days (at 443MW) has been slightly lower than its Maximum Capacity (480MW) (b) but this is a little confusing to me, as 443MW was the number I had in my head as roughly what the capacity of the unit was, so would need to dig more thoroughly i. to see when (and potentially why) it’s capability was increased to 480MW ii. or perhaps to correct some mistaken understanding on my part.",

    "title": "Watt scarcity?",
    "date": "19-08-2024 02:05:00 PM",
    "content": "Late July and early August saw a series of price volatility events across the NEM, most of which received some level of coverage here on WattClarity . This somewhat speculative post looks at whether “scarcity of supply” or other factors may have driven that volatility. Let’s start with the pattern of events for Q3 2024 to date, summarised via daily average and maximum 5-minute prices by region: While South Australia experienced the highest volatility, all regions saw days of elevated 5-minute and daily average pricing, concentrated in the period between 28 July and 6 August. The following table summarizes the impact of these price spikes on quarter to date regional averages (up to 12 August): The “spike contribution” here is the difference between the full quarter to date average and the average if we drop out half-hourly periods with average price exceeding $2,000/MWh. This differs from the conventional measure of volatility as price contribution in excess of $300/MWh, to focus more sharply on extreme price events and their impacts. Outside South Australia, most of these events involved only a single half-hourly period containing elevated 5-minute dispatch prices. On Monday 5th August , there was significant NEM-wide volatility covering a couple of hours over both morning and evening peaks. Half-hours of signifiant volatility are summarised in the next chart. While South Australia saw the most volatility, its causes are often quite specific to that region, typically involving interconnector limitations. In this post I’m going to concentrate more on the geographically wider events highlighted above – these may be more useful for looking at broader drivers of volatility. Given the morning and evening peak times of day at which these events fell, a first thought might be that tight supply-demand conditions lay behind the volatility. The NEM spot market, in particular its energy-only payment structure and high Market Price Cap (currently $17,500/MWh), is very deliberately designed to allow volatility events at times of supply scarcity. This is intended to provide adequate financial returns for infrequently-used peaking plant and to create investment signals for new dispatchable capacity to mitigate that supply scarcity and maintain system reliability. Below is the NEM-wide supply mix on 5 August. Solid colour series underneath the dark grey Demand line show aggregate capacity of each source fuel type dispatched to meet demand while their faded counterparts above the Demand line show the remaining available capacity offered to the market but not dispatched. The ratio of this ‘spare’ available capacity to demand is roughly the system’s instantaneous reserve plant margin (IRPM). One obvious feature of this day is the low wind contribution, averaging only around 1,000 MW across the NEM, and requiring higher than typical dispatch of more expensive sources like gas. Nevertheless, the system’s reserve margin levels – particularly over the morning peak price period – are nowhere near levels that should give any concerns about system reliability, or signal genuine scarcity of generation. System planners use reserve margin as a very rough correlate of reliability and like to see levels exceeding 15-20% , but their forward-looking measure would typically be formulated in terms of total installed firm or dispatchable capacity relative to maximum system demand, rather than an “instantaneous” measure. The real-time IRPM in a reliable system may well be lower at times of significant plant outages – since one function of the planning reserve margin is to provide a buffer for such outages. Looked at another way, despite low renewables contribution during the events illustrated above, there was in excess of 4GW undispatched firm capacity available throughout. The other days of more limited NEM-wide volatility also showed similar patterns of dispatch and levels of undispatched available capacity. And while I haven’t focussed on South Australia in this post, it was evident in my recent analysis of battery performance over the extended price spike on 30 July that supply scarcity per se was not the key driver of that price outcome. So these high NEM-wide prices were hardly signalling absolute scarcity of system reserves. What else might have caused them? Whose watts where? While there are many possible factors, ownership of generation capacity might be an interesting angle to investigate. Prices spiking in the absence of genuine capacity shortage might be an indication of ownership concentration, particularly of the dispatchable peaking resources that often set prices at times of high net demand. Here’s a breakdown of the NEM’s dispatchable generation capacity: This divides generation owners (or controllers) into two groupings: The “Big Four” group who own or control more than half the NEM’s dispatchable capacity, have major assets across multiple regions, and in total control nearly three-quarters of the NEM’s higher cost peaking capacity “Everyone else”, comprising Four significant government owned and essentially single-region entities who control about 30% of the NEM’s dispatchable capacity – heavily concentrated on lower cost “baseload” and mid-merit generation Other owners with much smaller generation footprints The classification of generation capacity into “Base & mid merit”, “Peaking” capacity, and Battery classes is somewhat arbitrary but intended to capture the different roles and capabilities of the underlying resources. Most gas-fired assets sit in the “Peaking” category, but I’ve put slower-start and combined cycle generators into the Base & mid merit grouping. It might seem odd to also locate Tasmania’s hydro assets in this group while Snowy’s are classified as Peaking, but the nature of Tasmania’s hydro system and its more limited contribution to mainland supply via Basslink make this an arguable distinction. The fact that the Big Four control more than half the NEM’s dispatchable capacity, and nearly three-quarters of what I’ve labelled as “Peaking”, means that it seems natural to look at how the two broad ownership groupings deployed their assets during recent high price events. We can also check the relative dispatched / undispatched levels of different generation classes at the same time. Monday 5th August 2024 (morning) Here’s the morning event on 5 August (which was noted briefly here at the time): The scope of this view has been narrowed a little by excluding Queensland, since prices didn’t spike there during this event. Also, the “By class” and “By owner” views limit generation to the fully-dispatchable fuel types, since solar and wind contributions were small and fully dispatched in any case. The middle and right panels make it pretty clear that most of the available but undispatched assets during these price spikes – which remained undispatched due to being offered to the market at very high prices – were: (centre panel) as expected, predominantly in the “Peaking” class, although there is also about 1.3 GW of undispatched Base & mid-merit plant through the event; (right-hand panel) perhaps unexpectedly (?), almost entirely owned by the Big Four generators , with only a very small slice of undispatched generation owned by others. Here it is worth noting that with Queensland excluded, the Big Four’s share of installed peaking capacity rises to nearly 88%, with Snowy Hydro alone controlling more than 50%. Monday 5th August 2024 (evening) Below is the corresponding view for the evening event on 5 August: Which was noted briefly here at the time In this case, Queensland saw high prices and has been included, while Tasmania misses out: These show similar relativities in dispatched and undispatched capacity, albeit with a slightly higher proportion of the undispatched capacity being non-Big Four. Tuesday 30th July 2024 (evening) Picking the shorter events on a couple of other days, on the evening of 30 July (already discussed in some articles here ) we see: Wednesday 31st July 2024 (evening) And on Wednesday 31 July (already discussed in some articles here ): Both of these latter two NEM-wide events show similar dispatch patterns to the evening of 5 August. Does all this mean that the large generation owners are somehow “manipulating the market” to raise prices? That would be a premature and probably naïve conclusion to jump to, especially on the basis of very limited evidence. But the question of why so much capacity was only offered to the market at extremely high prices during these events should be of great interest to all stakeholders in the market, if only to gain a better understanding of market dynamics. A potential line of explanation would take into account the contract positions of generators and wholesale energy purchasers (typically retailers). The spot market isn’t the only game in town Most NEM generators have financial contract obligations to consider. These may be wholesale swap or futures derivatives traded with counterparties, or in the case of gentailers (combined generation / retail entities) “implicit contracts” which support fixed-price retail supply to their organisation’s own customers. If a generator’s physical output is less than the volume of contracts it has explicitly or implicitly sold, it must effectively buy the volume difference at the spot market price. This provides a very strong incentive on each generation owner to “cover their contract position”, by dispatching sufficient generation in the physical spot market to at least match their sold contract volume. This incentive militates against offering contracted generation to the spot market at extreme prices – if the spot price is only a little less extreme, the generator will not be dispatched but will still have to financially settle its sold contract volumes, which could be very expensive. Similarly, at least at times of high spot price, spot market buyers, typically retailers, would generally seek to have enough bought contract volume – and / or dispatch of their own generation (if any) – to hedge their total energy purchases from the spot market. Remember that the NEM is “gross” pool design where virtually all physical generation output and end-use consumption is settled through the spot market. Contracting activities are an adjunct to, not a replacement for, spot market transactions. This financial and implicit contracting activity to hedge price risks was always foreseen as an important element of the NEM design complementing the spot market. We can very roughly visualize its outworkings as follows: While this diagram overlays spot and contract market elements, it is critical to understand that the spot market operates quite independently of contract market activity and contracted positions. It provides a physical dispatch and spot pricing mechanism that keeps generation and load (demand) in balance. Spot market operator AEMO has no knowledge of what contracts any market participant might hold. Market participants independently manage the financial interplay of their own physical and contract positions, through how they choose to bid in the spot market and the nature of any contracting activity they undertake. The diagram greatly simplifies contracting in the NEM, but illustrates how market loads may be partially hedged via contracts with generators, or via ownership of generation capacity (implicit hedging), or – at times – left partly unhedged, perhaps intentionally or perhaps because load is higher than expected. Load is highly dynamic across time, varying with time of day, weather, rooftop PV output and self-consumption and other factors, so the balance of hedged and unhedged load will also be highly dynamic, as will the proportion of generation that is effectively contracted or uncontracted. For the reasons discussed earlier, when spot prices are high, generation that is contracted will have strong incentives to bid in a way that ensures a dispatch level at least meeting its contract volume. This translates to not bidding that capacity at extreme prices. However the “unhedged dispatched generation” highlighted in the diagram represents a slice of capacity that needs to be dispatched in the spot market to meet physical demand, but does not face the same contractual incentives to offer at low prices. We can therefore think of the spot price being determined at times by rivalry amongst the owners of uncontracted generation capacity . Since contract positions are strictly private information, we have no way of knowing who those owners are at any given time, what the market aggregate levels of contracted and uncontracted capacity might be, and therefore how small or large is the slice of unhedged generation required to be dispatched, and the size of the pool competing to supply it. The best we can do is draw inferences – which may or may not be reliable – from observed spot market outcomes and behaviour. More questions than answers The purpose of that lengthy digression into contract market dynamics was to point out that understanding the reasons for extreme spot market prices and the bidding behaviour behind them can’t be divorced from the outcomes of the financial and implicit contracting that takes place well in advance of real time dispatch. These outcomes critically influence how participants in the spot market will bid. In seeking answers to why the Big Four participants seem to have disproportionately bid generation at extreme offer prices in the cases examined above, we might speculate that significantly more of their generation capacity was uncontracted at the time of these events than was the case for other generation owners. A substantial volume of uncontracted generation, if offered to the market only at prices near the market cap, increases the likelihood of price spikes at times when load is higher than expected, or perhaps when other owners’ generation is unavailable (which might include low output from renewable sources that they either own or have contracted with, due to time of day and the vagaries of weather). These contracting effects could significantly affect spot market outcomes even when the system has ample physical reserves of generation, as seems to have been the case in these recent events. Analysing possible reasons for a (hypothetical) imbalance in contracting levels arising in the first place, and indeed whether it’s a problem or not, is a much larger topic than a post like this can cover. The question I’d like to close with though is this: The justification for the NEM’s very high market price cap is often presented explicitly in terms of providing adequate returns on investment for generation required to support system reliability (for example in the Reliability Panel’s recent analyses [1] ). Does the fact that other drivers – such as contracting levels and contract market behaviour, perhaps combined with ownership concentration in specific types of generation – may also lead to recurring price outcomes near that market cap mean that other aspects of the broader market design or industry structure need more attention, or simply that some participants might have been wiser in their generation development and contracting decisions than others? [1] Modelling for the Reliability Panel’s determination of the market price cap (MPC) and cumulative price threshold (CPT) is based on finding optimum levels for these parameters that will provide adequate revenue for sufficient investment in peaking capacity to meet the market’s reliability standard. The modelling also accounts for price volatility at times unrelated to reliability events (periods of unserved energy or “USE”). This means that price outcomes at MPC during USE events are not necessarily assumed to deliver all the revenues required for this capacity. But it is not clear if or to what extent non-USE volatility – the kind examined in this post – is assumed in the Panel’s analysis to be impacted by the level of MPC / CPT selected. ================================================================================================= About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

    "content": "A short note with this snapshot from NEMwatch at 12:40 showing the ‘ Market Demand ’ in the QLD region down at 2,975MW … which is the lowest point it’s been for over 20 years : We see in the snapshot above that: 1) The ‘ Market Demand ’ at this point is down in the dark blue range … but not quite the ‘lowest ever’ based on the long-range statistics held in the background within NEMwatch to set the minimum (dark blue) and maximum (red) colour range for each region. 2) We also see that the rooftop PV yield is going gangbusters at this point (AEMO estimates are delayed but earlier estimates were ~4,000MW production from rooftop PV systems … readers should remember that they are estimates only because production is actually invisible !) Let’s briefly consider… (A) Records for QLD at both ends of the spectrum … within 8 months! The series of SMS alerts triggered by our ez2view software (beginning in the 12:30 dispatch interval, at 3,016.38MW) alerted me to the fact that the demand had dropped lower than the 3,017MW level seen on Sunday 1st October 2023 , a day that saw a number of different milestones reached (as noted in that collation of articles ): Ironically, the last time I received a demand-related alert (for any region) was back on 22nd January 2024 when QLD smashed the prior record for all-time maximum . Having records at both ends fall within an 8 month period is a sign of the increasing challenge in making this energy transition work. (B) The unavoidable challenges of rooftop PV Using a pre-configured query from NEMreview v7, we quickly see the long-range trend of monthly minimum demand looking back 25 years and including several different measures: It’s not really a coincidence that we’re seeing an increasing number of articles speaking to the underlying challenges that the rooftop PV juggernaut is delivering to the ongoing functioning of the grid. Some articles are more considered than others (just as the arguments of various energy-sector stakeholders) … here’s just two examples: 1) On Friday 16th August 2024 (in the AFR) Matthew Warren wrote ‘Five reasons the power grid needs a major redesign’ , including rooftop PV as 5th … though he wrote: ‘ Finally , the biggest disruption to the current market is rooftop solar PV. It’s a huge regulated solar engine outside the market which sends wholesale prices crashing every sunny day, undermining the commercial case for utility-scale renewables, and everything else too. Rooftop solar PV is going to keep growing because it’s hugely popular and untouchable politically . We need a market that works with it , or at least stops different types of renewables from cutting each other’s lunch.’ Let’s hope the Productivity Commission is up to the challenge! 2) Then there’s this (more sensationalist?) article by Blake Antrobus on the News Corp platform that I read earlier this morning: Too much of a good thing?",

    "date": "14-08-2024 08:00:00 PM",
    "content": "A short, belated and back-dated article to note that the AEMO began publishing actual intermittent generators (SCADA) availability data: to the EMMS Data Model in the Production environment from August 13th 2024 and to NEMWeb from August 14th 2024. Earlier invisibility of actual (physical) availability of Semi-Scheduled units Back on 3rd April 2020, Marcelle had written suggesting these enhancements in the article ‘Semi-scheduled Generation Availability Forecasts–how to improve?’ , with a key point being noted in this section: ‘ Improving the process There are two mechanisms that a semi-scheduled generator uses to communicate information on its availability to AEMO for input to AWEFS or ASEFS. In real-time there are SCADA readings, including the Turbines/Inverters Available signal, plus the Local Limit signal which indicates a plant-wide limitation on output. Generators also provide a range of real-time meteorological measurements including wind speed, wind direction and temperature. For the pre-dispatch and ST-PASA timeframes (out to a week) there is the AEMO EMMS portal, where generators enter the number of Turbines or Inverters that are unavailable for each half-hour, plus an “Upper MW Limit” which is a plant-wide limitation on output. There are at least four factors that determine how effective this forecasting process is: (a) technically how accurately the forecasts can be calculated; (b) how well determined and understood the forecasting roles and information flows are between the different parts of the system; (c) how easy it is for participants to provide the right information; and (d) the capacity for feedback and continuous improvement.’ Elsewhere, we’ve also noted some long-running challenges with invisibility of some data for Semi-Scheduled generators…. AEMO transparency initiative … so it was great to see the AEMO commence the publication of this data.

Rainfall totals were extreme on the 12th and 13th August 2024, leading into 9am Wednesday on the 14th. Weatherzone reported it was the wettest pair of days in August on record in Rockhampton! The post intrigued us to check for the expected impacts to solar energy production. Because, of course, where there’s rain there’s usually cloud. We focused on Queensland in this post. Reduced large-scale solar was forecast in advance Firstly we looked at large-scale solar availability using ez2view’ forecast convergence widget. The UIGF is the unconstrained intermittent availability forecast – essentially the estimate of how much power the solar units will produce given the sunshine and any physical restrictions. The image below, captures the 13th and the 12th as the two recent days where potential solar output was expected to be considerable lower than usual. The reduced levels were well forecast as indicated by the outlooks made 2.5 days earlier (t-120 periods before latest forecast). AEMO large-scale solar forecasts anticipated the reduced availability 2.5 days in advance. Source: ez2view. Rooftop solar was near-lowest for the winter We analysed the estimated output of rooftop solar panels in Queensland. Understandably, output was a near-record low for the 2024 winter. The following chart shows how output on the 12th and 13th were both well below average (mean) for the winter to-date.

    "title": "A look at storage levels at the Iona underground storage facility, August 2024",
    "date": "06-08-2024 02:32:00 PM",
    "content": "Firming capacity increasingly critical The last few weeks, and much of the winter, has repeatedly helped draw our attention back to the role of firming electricity supply during periods when VRE is low and electricity demand is elevated. We’ve seen how an extended late-July cold snap coincided with transmission limitations to send prices to the roof in SA and wider – one such run of three days was noted by Paul here on WattClarity . And that same period demonstrated how storage systems don’t have perfect foresight, covered in Allan’s article “ With the benefit of hindsight – or who’d be an auto-bidder? “. And, with what we attribute to low rainfall in TAS, reduced hydro generation capability supported Tamar Valley’s GPG running for almost 7 weeks straight. Gas-powered generation (GPG) is a critical source of electricity supply now, for peak periods, and is expected to continue to be over the coming decade(s). It seems this winter has seen it be relied upon no less than before. Gas storage for the south: Iona Underground Storage* In the current GSOO (March 2024) , in the discussion on midstream gas infrastructure (this is the linkage between gas producers and gas consumers), Figure 33 of the report demonstrates that Iona UGS is routinely relied upon to inject at high rates [withdraw from storage] to support demand. *There is shallow storage for the south but peak volumes stored are generally up to around 2,000 TJ – less than a 10th of Iona’s capacity. Here’s that Figure 33 of the GSOO, mentioned earlier: AEMO’s 2024 GSOO The GSOO noted 2021 and 2022 saw the greatest daily withdrawal in the past five years, both above 400 TJ/d. And since that time of publication, the 2024 peak withdrawal rate has entered the rankings. This year, 2024, the 17 th July saw a withdrawal rate of 432 TJ/d, making it the second highest on record since 2018. 2021’s max rate was 460 TJ/d and the now third highest was 2022 at 407 TJ/d. In 2024 there were additionally 3 other days with withdrawal rates over 400 TJ/d. The max withdrawal rate is now 570 TJ/d. The GSOO remarks that “Deep and shallow storages are forecast to continue to provide critical injection capacity close to large demand centres downstream of north-to-south transmission pipeline constraints. Storage levels will require appropriate management to ensure maximum injection rates can be provided on peak days and/or sustained across multiple high demand days when necessary. Under extreme weather conditions, the existing capacity provided by storages is still forecast to be insufficient to avoid gas shortfalls.” Due to this, we review Iona’s storage levels to-date. Storage levels at Iona For the 2024 winter, Iona’s capacity is 24,500 TJ owing to the completion of upgrades in 2023. In the 2023 GSOO analysis charts indicated the minimum operable storage level is about 6,000 TJ. The following chart shows how storage levels have changed since 2018. ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ This year, 2024, storage was at a relatively high level in January owing to lower than average gas demand in 2023. The storage level managed to climb higher by April which is the typical time for peak storage levels prior to winter. Since May 2024, levels have steadily dropped with withdrawals. Currently the level sits at 10,134 TJ, at the end of gas day 4 August 2024. An outlook? Storage levels will of course relate to production, transfers and demand for gas (and electricity). So the contributors to storage levels are numerous and complex. Yet, from the chart, we can observe brief periods of decline are still possible into in September although these are usually among days when the net level is increased. Therefore, some further declines may still occur but history suggests we are turning the corner soon on storage levels at Iona, in time for refilling for the 2025 winter.",

    "content": "Earlier today we wrote about the ‘ Morning burst of volatility across the NEM on Monday 5th August 2024 ’ … so this is an accompanying piece starting with this snapshot from NEMwatch at the 17:55 dispatch interval on Monday 5th August 2024 : Quick notes… (A) What to watch There’s a couple things to watch here: (A1) Tight supply-demand balance For those with their own copies of NEMwatch (or in ez2view it’s in the ‘NEM summary stats’ widget) you can keep an eye on the NEM-wide IRPM , which has dropped down below 15% into the ‘yellow alert’ level this evening. … those with access to our SMS alerts facility might like to configure their own SMS alert on this metric being below 15% as: (a) that happens quite rarely (b) but, when it does, it indicates tight supply-demand balance In the snapshot above it had dropped below 15% for the first dispatch interval (to 14.70%). (A2) Watch prices Of course, watch the Dispatch/Trading Prices! Plenty of tools for that. (A3) Watch the Cumulative Price (more than just South Australia, now) Back On Wednesday 31st July we wrote a warning to ‘Keep an eye on the Cumulative Price … especially in South Australia’ . (a) We see above that the Cumulative Price in South Australia has is above $1,000,000 (and so over half the way to the Cumulative Price Threshold ). (b) Other regions (particularly NSW and VIC) are also climbing! (A4) Watch FCAS Prices! Remembering the prior exhortation ‘Don’t forget about FCAS!’ it’s useful to highlight that there’s also some spicy prices for some FCAS commodities in some regions, as captured in this snapshot from the ‘NEM Prices’ widget in ez2view at 18:10: (B) An initial list of Contributing factors This morning I listed four contributing factors for this morning’s volatility … they are similar this evening as well… (A1) Evening peak in demand In the NEMwatch snapshot above we see the typical shape for an evening peak in ‘ Market Demand ’ (noting in the snapshot that this has climbed over 30,000MW and would be expected to climb further). Keep in mind that: (a) The absolute level is important; (b) But also is the rate of ramping required. (A2) Low wind The low wind conditions noted this morning have continued … it’s been below 1,000MW since noted this morning. (A3) Low solar Whilst solar yield was depressed in sunlight hours because of cloud cover (noted this morning) at this point the sun’s pretty much gone to bed for the winter bedtime. A4) 7 (of 44) Coal units out This morning we presented a snapshot from the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view snapped at the 09:30 dispatch interval … at the time noting that there were 7 coal units offline (a combination of planned and forced outages). Late this afternoon Loy Yang A4 also came offline, as captured in this ez2view alert in the ‘Notifications’ widget at the time. So, by my count, that’s still 7 units out this evening (as GSTONE4 came back online during the day) … but LYA4 is larger (lower cost) and more important. A5) Other factors No doyubt there are other factors….",

    "date": "05-08-2024 03:13:00 PM",
    "content": "South Australia experienced two blocks of volatile spot prices on Tuesday 30 July , exceeding $1,000/MWh in 32 dispatch intervals between 17:10 and 20:50 (NEM time, or AEST). Other regions also saw a handful of high price intervals, including the notable NEM-wide event in the interval ending 18:00. The average South Australian spot price for the day was over $1,480/MWh, nearly five times higher than averages in other NEM regions. This post picks up on Linton’s analysis of bidding in South Australia to focus on: The role of interconnector limitations The behaviour of the region’s growing battery fleet Some challenges arising under extreme market conditions for the ‘autobidder’ software used to manage batteries’ market dispatch Ez2view ’s NEM-wide map at 18:00 has been reproduced in a few places already, but here it is again with the interconnectors between South Australia and Victoria highlighted: The Murraylink DC interconnector was out of service at the time, and the Heywood AC interconnection was also significantly limited by a scheduled line outage . This limitation particularly affected maximum flows from Victoria into South Australia, generally to less than 50 MW and at times forced flows from generators and batteries in south-eastern South Australia into Victoria. These outages and limitations meant that for most of its price volatility episode, South Australia was economically islanded from the rest of the NEM. Had the Heywood interconnector been able to carry its normal ~600 MW capacity into South Australia, that region’s excess volatility would have disappeared. As things turned out, spot prices reflected specific bidding behaviour by South Australian generators as identified in Linton’s post, particularly: A proportion of the thermal fleet’s available capacity being offered at five-digit price levels Variable contributions from the regional battery fleet I’ll concentrate on the latter in the next section of this post. Battery behaviour Here’s Linton’s chart of aggregate bidding and dispatch outcomes for the South Australian battery fleet: There was a maximum of about 400 MW of battery capacity offered to the market for the initial high price period, with output peaking at around half that capacity (implying that the remaining available capacity was offered at higher prices, close to the market cap). During the second high price block starting at 19:15, batteries again initially dispatched a little under half of their maximum capacity, but fleet availability then rapidly declined, falling close to zero about halfway through this volatility episode. This seems to indicate that, partially depleted by their initial response to the high prices from 17:10, and having continued to discharge during the period of more moderate prices from 18:05 to 19:10, the fleet simply ran out of stored energy during the second block of more extreme prices. We’ll come back a bit later to the (apparently) obvious question of why the fleet continued to discharge during the hour of ‘moderate’ prices between the two extreme price blocks, leaving themselves with insufficient stored energy to more fully capitalise on the second run of volatility. First, we can easily confirm that lack of stored energy was the issue in the case of AGL’s Torrens Island Battery , at 250 MW the largest storage unit in the region. It is now registered as a ‘Bidirectional’ unit and one of AEMO’s reported data items for these units is state of charge or stored energy level. This is graphed in the middle panel of the following chart along with its output (negative when recharging), accompanied by South Australian spot prices in the upper panel, and the battery’s offered generation availability in the lower panel: Energy stored in this battery reached 227 MWh by mid afternoon, slightly less than one hour of charge at the battery’s maximum output, and then fell through the evening volatility periods, becoming close to depleted (10 MWh) by 20:05, at which point its availability to generate not surprisingly fell to zero. While most other batteries in South Australia don’t yet report their stored energy, with a bit of back-calculation based on output levels and calibration against the observed result for Torrens Island, we can infer the storage position for the rest of the region’s fleet to produce an aggregate view: Since the Torrens Island battery represents about 60% of operating fleet capacity, this not surprisingly shows a very similar overall outcome – stored energy ran down over about three hours , consistent with a fleet aggregate storage duration of about one hour at maximum discharge rates, and output averaging one third of that maximum rate over the depletion period. The next chart shows output and stored energy for individual batteries (aggregated in the case of SA Water’s fleet of small storage units): Patterns of operation are similar across the fleet, although the Dalrymple battery which has a very small storage capacity (just 20 minutes or so) only discharged at the tail end of the second high price period. A challenge for autobidders Overall, this episode is a neat (or perhaps messy?) illustration of the challenges for battery operators in managing a very limited quantity of stored energy* over a relatively long period of price volatility. * Some time ago, the authors of GenInsights21 shared their Observation 5/22 about ‘the rise of Just in Time’ with readers here on WattClarity. All the batteries in the fleet reached the start of the first volatility period holding close to their maximum charge, but then appeared to ‘waste’ nearly half of that valuable stored energy by continuing to discharge after the end of that period but before the second more extreme block of volatility arrived. Why? One part of the answer lies in the interconnector limitations we noted in the first part of this post. In the screenshot at the right I’ve mashed together a couple of ez2view charts showing actual and forecast flows on the Heywood interconnector, together with projected South Australian spot prices, as at 17:00 on 30 July. The forecast sections of these charts are drawn from AEMO’s predispatch (market forecast) datasets. These AEMO forecasts combine projections at 5-minute granularity for the first forward hour (updated every five minutes), followed by half-hourly projections for later times (only updated at the start of each half hour). They show the projected arrival of high spot prices within the next hour, and also illustrate that the tight Heywood interconnector (‘V-SA’) limits were at this time expected to be released for the half hour ending 19:30 (presumably by the start of that interval, at 19:00), on completion of the relevant line outage works. This timing coincides with the retreat of projected prices from 5-digit levels. Batteries’ autobidding software would almost certainly use these projections, probably supplemented by internal forecasts or otherwise algorithmically processed, as one input to their optimisation calculations, which are broadly aimed at achieving maximum value for battery capacity and stored energy across the NEM’s energy and FCAS markets. In the energy market, this very roughly entails a daily arbitrage cycle of recharging at times of lower spot prices and seeking to discharge when spot prices peak – in reality the optimisation involved is much more nuanced, but the basic idea of ‘buy low, sell high’ is enough for our purposes here. Given the above view of projected spot prices, and the expected release of the Heywood interconnector limitations from 19:00 onwards, we might expect batteries’ bidding strategy over the next two hours being set up to discharge much of their stored energy at times of maximum price, before the interconnector restrictions lift. With only one hour’s worth of energy available (on average), this still requires some smart rationing of available capability, and explains why the batteries output at only up to half their maximum power during the first period of volatility. Even more so because there is no certainty about how long a period of high prices might actually last nor how high prices will actually go. To illustrate the last point, moving forward 10 minutes shows that high prices have arrived earlier than projected, with the SA spot price at $3,936.60/MWh for the interval ending 17:10: At this stage the immediate forecast doesn’t show the high spot prices returning until about 17:55, but … … jumping forward to 18:05, we see that prices remained elevated for almost all the intervals after 17:10: The spot price has now fallen back to $1,039.68/MWh and projected prices over the next hour look more moderate than in the earlier projections but still in 4-digit territory. Recall from the earlier charts that at this point the battery fleet has used about a quarter of its stored energy discharging into the high prices over the previous 55 minutes. So far the batteries’ aggregate bidding and dispatch behaviour seems sound – stored energy has been directed into the initial block of high prices and plenty held in reserve for high prices projected to occur up until 19:00 when the interconnector restrictions ease. But 10 minutes later those price projections have softened considerably: By now the batteries’ autobidding algorithms may have collectively determined that the next 45 minutes are as long as even moderately elevated spot prices (currently $999.43/MWh) might persist, and continued to discharge energy during these intervals. At 18:40 this strategy still looks OK – prices have retreated to $360.75/MWh and now no further price spikes are being projected: So although batteries have run down their stored energy to about half capacity by continuing to discharge after the initial volatility period, this would appear to have realised better value for that energy than reserving it for higher prices that didn’t eventuate – so far. But a closer look at the Heywood interconnector projection in the top panel of that last chart shows an important change – the flow limits now persist out to the end of the 5-minute predispatch projections at 19:35 . These limits were originally projected to ease in the half-hour ending at 19:30, ie by 19:00. That is no longer the case, and it seems the line outage is running longer than scheduled. This means that the risk of higher prices in South Australia persists for significantly longer than previously expected, even if the current projection still shows only ~$300/MWh prices through this period. Nearly half an hour later, prices have followed that forecast, but there is still no release of the interconnector restrictions within the next hour: And having continued to discharge, the battery fleet is now down to about 40% of its storage capacity: Five minutes later things go a bit pear-shaped (if you’re a battery autobidder) – price volatility suddenly reappears in the predispatch forecasts, coinciding with the continuation of the interconnector limitations until (at least) 20:00: Forward another five minutes and it’s now worse than pear-shaped. The spot price is $12,500/MWh and the projected volatility block is solid at or above this price for the remainder of the outage period: For anyone cross-referencing Linton’s article , this interval corresponds with the rebid of all the available 140 MW of gas-fired capacity at AGL’s Barker Inlet plant to the market price cap of $17,500/MWh. Probably not a coincidence. There’s no point in stepping through further interval-by-interval detail from here. Ultimately the interconnector outage and limits remained in place even longer, not ending until 21:20 (dispatch interval ending 21:25), more than two hours later than originally expected. The second block of price volatility ultimately lasted 95 minutes from 19:15 until 20:50, when demand eased sufficiently for spot prices to retreat: Conclusions – ouch Perhaps lulled into a false sense of security by predispatch price projections that didn’t anticipate an extension of the interconnector outage (and couldn’t anticipate any generator rebidding* to leverage the impact of that extension), by the time the second volatility block arrived, battery autobidders found themselves with their storage capacity only a little over one-third full. Not surprisingly, they mostly discharged the remaining energy they had over the next 45 minutes or so, before retiring hors de combat . For future dispatch intervals, AEMO’s predispatch projections use whatever bids are in place for those future intervals at the time the forecast is run. Participants can subsequently modify those bids at any time before dispatch (subject to a ~20-30 second technical “gate closure” window – described here as Gate Closure #2 ), provided they comply with the market rules concerning “good faith bidding” and the Australian Energy Regulator’s guidelines. In summary, the episode highlights two distinct difficulties for autobidders (or even human bidders) in managing a battery fleet with relatively short storage duration: Even with perfect foresight, energy in storage has to be rationed across a volatility period of any significant length, limiting batteries’ ability to either profit from or suppress that volatility. Short storage duration significantly reduces margins for error and amplifies the risks arising from using inherently imperfect forecasts to set up and execute a bidding and dispatch strategy. To illustrate the financial impact of these challenges, an admittedly gratuitous calculation of the revenue opportunity missed by South Australia’s batteries in discharging between the two extreme price period runs as follows: Between dispatch intervals 18:05 and 19:10, the South Australian fleet discharged just under 160 MWh of stored energy – about 40% of their storage capacity – which earned spot revenue of about $82,000 , achieving an average price of about $520/MWh . Had this energy been available for discharge in the second volatility period from 19:15, it could have earned revenue of up to $2.4 million at an average price of over $15,000/MWh .

Here’s a snapshot of the 07:15 dispatch interval this morning via NEMwatch : … and here’s a snapshot just over two hours later (at the 09:20 dispatch interval) with the prices just subsided: Some quick notes… (A) An initial list of Contributing factors Let’s start by noting that there are bound to be more than just the following four factors – but here’s a starting list: (A1) Morning peak in demand In the NEMwatch snapshots we see the typical shape for a morning peak in demand – with the highest point being at 07:55 this morning just under 28,000MW (measuring ‘ Market Demand ’). Keep in mind that, whilst that level’s not huge, it does present a ramping requirement which might have been coupled with other factors! (A2) Low wind This morning’s peak in demand has coincided with low wind yield across the NEM (it’s dropped under 1,000MW around 08:30 and is trending lower still). (A3) Low solar It’s winter, so solar does not rise as early as in the summer months – but this has been exacerbated by cloud cover that’s delivered lower yield. A quick look (image not shown here) at one of our dashboard indicates that Large Solar yield at ~09:30 is perhaps ~2,500MW lower than the equivalent yield in previous days. The same factor would be at play in rooftop PV … though this should show up in higher ‘ Market Demand ’ (and i’ve not had time to check). PS1 … update from Weatherzone on LinkedIn I noticed this update from Weatherzone on LinkedIn on Monday afternoon: (A4) 7 (of 44) Coal units out There are a number of coal units offline at present, as we see in the snapshot from the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view this morning: (B) Watching South Australia … will it pop?

A blip in TAS at 10:55 iii. And perhaps this evening. That’s led to a number of articles here on WattClarity … and also the article ‘Generators fill their pockets again, pushing grid prices to new highs and leaving renewables to cop the blame’ on RenewEconomy , which featured a familiar image from the ‘NEM Map’ widget in ez2view : With respect to the image above: 1) On the left is Giles’ article, including the ez2view image … 2) Which came from Linton’s earlier review ‘Energy price volatility on 30th July 2024’ (which was updated on-the-fly through Tuesday evening 30th July 2024 ). 3) Linton followed that yesterday with ‘An initial pass over ENERGY bids during price volatility of 30th July 2024’ : (a) Linton chose to focus particularly on South Australia, given that was where most of the volatility had been seen (and pressure on the Cumulative Price ). (b) But our intention is that we’ll also do something similar on a NEM-wide basis … just need to wait until we’ve finished a few other things first! 4) But what particularly jumped out to me was Giles’ comment above the ez2view image, which I’ve copied in here for ease of reference: ‘Yes, wind output was down, but the AER chronicled in forensic detail how big players took advantage of the competitive power after multiple coal plant trips and failures, to indulge in a whole series of deliberate bidding patterns , removed capacity at low prices, and were also caught in the apparent deliberate slow ramping up of units for this situation. Not that the AER could do much about, because apparently no rules were broken. Must have been good for consumers then, although clearly not, as the AER itself observed. The same situation likely happened on Tuesday, and to a lesser but still significant extent on Monday . And the price forecasts suggest it is going to happen again on Wednesday, and Thursday too.,’ Giles is either referencing: 1) the AER’s review of Q2 (which was published this time at the same time as the AEMO’s QED); or 2) the AER’s earlier >$5000/MWh report … and wondering what bidding behaviour might show for the current week. So (remembering that we envisage looping back around to do something more systematic when more time is available) I thought I’d make a very quick/brief start here. Using the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view I’ve added this quick snapshot in here, looking back 14 days: (Remember to click on the image to open a larger size one in a separate tab) As noted before, the NEM’s a complex place … and with complex data sets like bidding behaviour the devil is in the details (i.e. including a review of behaviour of individual participants, which we don’t have time to do here) – but, at a high level in eyeballing this chart, it appears that: 1) There was more volume bid from $300/MWh down to the Market Price Floor (i.e. the green and blue colours) through the evening period on Mon 29th July 2024 and Tue 30th July 2024 than there were in any day back to Friday 19th July 2024: (a) The ‘cheap price energy’ was higher on Thursday evening 18th July and Friday evening 19th July : i. days where prices were subdued; ii. but no time to look at what else was going on for those days … or anything in between (from 20th July to 28th July). (b) For a more systematic review of volume bid in various price ranges, refer back to this ‘Updated trend of ‘ENERGY’ bids in red, green and blue’ . 2) What’s clear in this chart is that ( despite a higher volume of cheaper energy bid across all supply-side participants) one of the primary drivers of higher prices in times when it’s spiked across the NEM has been higher demand levels : (a) these are shown in the black line (and a grey line that’s also underneath as well, for those who want the details) (b) this higher ‘ Market Demand ’ level is driven by (amongst other things) the colder weather at present.",

    "title": "Callide C3 offline until expected return to service on Monday 26th August 2024",
    "date": "31-07-2024 07:54:00 PM",
    "content": "There’s been some volatility recently across the NEM … particularly in South Australia but also across all regions : 1) on Monday evening 29th July 2024 ; 2) on Tuesday evening 30th July 2024 ; 3) And also this evening … Wednesday 31st July 2024 . Earlier today, Linton posted this ‘… initial pass over ENERGY bids during price volatility of 30th July 2024’ with a focus on South Australia … but we might find time to do something more broadly across the whole of the NEM (though perhaps not immediately). Amongst the (many!) contributing factors NEM-wide will be the fact that both units at Callide C are now offline again . (A) Callide C4 remains offline As we have noted before, Callide C4 has been offline since 25th May 2021 and is expected to remain offline until 31st August 2024 … now exactly a month away. (B) Callide C3 offline again Readers will also recall that Callide C3 returned to service on 1st April 2024 after its own (not quite so) long outage, and has been operating since that time. Unfortunately we’ve seen that the unit came offline last Friday 26th July 2024 – as we see the snapshot from ez2view this afternoon at 15:25: With respect to this unit, please note the following: B1) Data gleaned from ez2view This snapshot shows two widgets: 1) At the top is the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view , which shows expected return to service currently as Monday 26th August 2024 . 2) At the bottom is the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget (filtered down to the CPP_3 unit and looking back 2 weeks), that shows the unit coming offline (ultimately with a trip) last Friday afternoon 26th July 2024 . B2) News Releases by CS Energy For more context, worth referring to these two recent News Releases from CS Energy : 1) last Saturday 27th July 2024, the company wrote ‘Statement regarding injury at Callide Power Station’ … which includes the passage: ‘In a separate incident, CS Energy has brought Unit C3 safely offline to investigate a technical fault in one of its battery chargers . At approximately 4pm yesterday, the Callide Operations team made the decision to safely bring Unit C3 offline. No one was injured. CS Energy has begun an investigation into why this incident occurred and is assessing timeframes for any necessary repairs or replacement of equipment. The affected equipment is within its warranty period, as it was commissioned in December 2023 . We have notified Workplace Health and Safety Queensland, and the scene is being preserved for the regulator. We have advised the Australian Energy Market Operator that Unit C3 is currently unavailable as part of our market disclosure requirements.’ 2) then yesterday 30th July 2024 , the company wrote ‘Update on Callide Unit C3 return to service’ … which reads: ‘The Callide C Power Station joint venture (JV) informed the market today of a revised return to service date for Unit C3 of 26 August 2024 (previously 3 August). Unit C3 was safely brought offline last Friday after a technical fault occurred on one of its battery chargers. The Callide C JV provided an initial forecast of 3 August for the unit’s return to service until we could obtain a better understanding of timeframes for repairs and restoration of the charger. The charger manufacturer has since inspected the charger at site and advised that it will undertake a rebuild and factory testing before returning it to Callide for installation and commissioning. This process is expected to take approximately four weeks. Preliminary investigations by the battery charger manufacturer indicate that the fault was the result of a component failure within the charger and was an extremely rare event. The affected equipment is within its warranty period as it was commissioned in December 2023. What occurred on Unit C3 last Friday was not the same type of incident as what happened with Unit C4 in 2021. CS Energy has additional redundancy built into its battery charger system because of the improvements we have made since the Unit C4 incident. These safeguards worked as designed last Friday and the team were able to safely shut down Unit C3 when the fault was detected.’ This new return to service expectation (26th August 2024) is as shown in the snapshot of the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view above.",

    "title": "An initial pass over ENERGY bids during price volatility of 30th July 2024 (focused on South Australia)",
    "date": "31-07-2024 12:08:00 PM",
    "content": "Yesterday’s price volatility, observed in Energy price volatility on 30th July 2024 , lasted longer than expected in SA. In in initial pass to review contributing factors, this article discusses energy bids as dispatched. We take a top-down look at bids by Fuel Type / Technology using the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view , time travelled back to 22:30 on Tuesday 30th July 2024. We look back 6 to 12 hours to capture the high-priced intervals and provide some context from the late afternoon. The screenshots: 1) Show ‘final bids’ (i.e. for each dispatch interval it shows the bids that NEMDE took into account in its dispatch process for that dispatch interval). Meaning we only see the final outcome of rebidding behaviour that impacted dispatch. 2) Focus primarily on SA . However we acknowledge that other regions also experienced elevated prices around 18:00. 3) Only present bids in the ENERGY market. Disclaimers First and foremost, readers should keep in mind the following disclaimers : 1) This analysis performed and published on Wednesday 31st July as an initial first pass. (a) We acknowledge the focus on bids does not explain the whole story, but we use it to flag top-down things that may see us direct more detailed focus in the days and weeks ahead, time permitting (i.e. we actually have other things to do as well!) (b) It’s done quickly, so there’s increased potential for mistakes in opting for speed. i. If any readers spot mistakes, it would be appreciated if you could point them out (in comments below, or directly); ii. If we become aware of mistakes we may update this article, but it’s not guaranteed. 2) We’ve noted below that ‘the NEM is a complex place’ , and readers should keep in mind the interconnected nature of the NEM , in several dimensions: (a) Firstly, it’s probably obvious to most people that just zooming in on bids in South Australia will overlook any impacts that came in the ENERGY market of other regions ; (b) Perhaps less well understood will be the ’interconnections’ across all 11 commodities (i.e. ENERGY and 10 x FCAS commodities). i. Just focusing on ENERGY will almost certainly overlook outcomes related to co-optimisation. ii.. We noted that some FCAS prices also spiked in the 18:00 interval . (c) Finally, worth also noting that this analysis just focuses on the ‘physical’ ENERGY market operated by AEMO. Tips in reading these ez2view charts… A few background tips on how to read these charts – which are from the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view : 1) We’ve added the spot price for the region of interest on these charts to provide you a reference point for the bidding activity. 2) There are lines for availability and power (output or consumption), targets are indicated in grey but generally not visible on the charts presented in this article’s top-down analysis. 3) Bids are ‘capped at dispatch target’. This is different to ‘capped at dispatch availability’, as the volumes available but not dispatched are omitted. (a) This means we see a gap between the top of the bid stack and availability. The gap represents the portion of volume offered and available but not dispatched (up to the availability line). (b) It’s important to note that there are MWs offered all the way up to the availability line, just that these turn out to be higher-priced than the dispatch price, hence not dispatched. (c) By capping at dispatch target we see the bid volumes that were used in dispatch. The volumes in price buckets therefore (generally) align with the energy price series and there is a clearer distinction between what was available and what was dispatched. (i) When we see a thin sliver of red at the top of the capped bid stack we can observe how it was only that visible portion that was dispatched. Higher priced offers would have sat above that dispatched level. 4) Users can create their own bid price buckets, and assign colours of their choice – but it makes sense (at least in this top-down review) to use the ‘Default Price Buckets’ which use three basic colour ranges: (a) BLUE = $0/MWh and below (with –$1,000/MWh being light blue … there’s a lot of that!). (b) GREEN = Above $0/MWh to $300/MWh (c) PINK and RED = Above $300/MWh. (d) GREY = eagle-eyed readers might spot a bit of grey near the 0MW line, which represents ‘Fixed Load’ (i.e. ‘must run’ price-taker bids). 5) When seeking to inspect the images in more detail, remember you can click on an image to open it as a larger view in another tab. SA energy bids – all units Reminding ourselves that the energy bids presented below are ‘Capped at Dispatch Target’ (it’s one of several options offered by ez2view … this option just takes the bids that were actually dispatched, so meaning the white space up to the dotted red ‘Availability’ line also contained bids … but these were not dispatched). SA ENERGY bids (all units) Observations from the ‘all units’ overview: Energy output was increasing since 15:00 and peaked at 2,306 MW at 18:50. There were two periods of volatility; 17:10 – 18:00 19:15 – 20:50 Around 16:30, there was an increase in volume offered in the low-priced buckets, it coincided with an increase in availability also. A distinct shift of volume between price buckets occurred at the start of the second volatility period, 19:15. With reduced volume in Green, and increased volume in stronger-Red buckets. There was a reduction in availability leading into to the dispatch interval of 20:00. This was the time from which the actual LOR1 condition was declared. The LOR1 lasted until 20:40. SA energy bids – Solar The next screenshot captures the bids as dispatched from large-scale solar units. SA ENERGY bids (Solar) Observations from the overview of Solar unit bids: Prices began their march into the 3,000 $/MWh range as output was declining. The first interval, 17:10, coincided with production levels at 113 MW. All dispatched volumes were offered at low prices. Availability generally matched output indicating full output, for the resource potential at the time. SA energy bids – Wind Perhaps the first thing evident in the next screenshot is that there wasn’t a whole lot of wind around. SA ENERGY bids (Wind) Observations from the overview of Wind unit bids: Prior to 15:00 there was some curtailment – availability was not fully dispatched. After 15:00 there was very little curtailment. At the beginning of the first volatility period 17:10 wind output was 124 MW. Available volumes were all offered below 0$/MWh across the evening. By the end of the second high-price period, 20:50, output had crept up to 363 MW. SA energy bids – Diesel Diesel units were dispatch with offers generally in the 150 – 300 $/MWh range. SA ENERGY bids (Diesel) Observations from the overview of Diesel unit bids: Output aligned with the beginning and end of the high price periods. Angaston, Lonsdale and Port Stanvac contributed energy. Units on the path to decommissioning – Port Lincoln and Snuggery – did not run. These units are not yet deregistered and as such are included in the Max Capacity total on the chart. SA energy bids – Gas Gas units ramped up from 15:00 and higher-priced volumes were progressively offered. SA ENERGY bids (Gas) Observations from the overview of Gas unit bids: The distinct shift of volume between price buckets that occurred at the start of the second volatility period, 19:15, and was noted in the ‘all units’ screenshot, is apparent here. Now attributed to gas unit rebids. Barkers Inlet rebid their full availability (140MW) at the market price cap for the 19:15 interval. There was more MWs available than dispatched (around 400 MW available in reserve). SA energy bids – Battery Storage Battery storage output was strong for the first high-price period, but managing the duration of the event proved difficult. The second high-price period saw energy production availability drop to 29 MW at 20:00, relative to the earlier high point of 396MW. This time aligned with the declaration of a LOR1 condition, though we aren’t able to assign any causal link in this high level inspection. SA ENERGY bids (Battery Storage) Observations from the overview of Battery Storage unit bids: Rebid reasons referencing state of charge management or ‘close to limit’ were referenced in rebids around 20:00. Some consumption (15 MW) was dispatched for Torrens Island BESS in the last high-price interval, 20:50, where the energy price was 12,500 $/MWh. Aggregate production availability levels began to increase from around 22:00 after and in conjunction with a somewhat better (relatively) price setting for charging. SA energy bids – Demand Side No negawatts were dispatched in the time period we’ve focused on. Zero-MW availability was offered from the single unit registered in SA. SA ENERGY bids (Demand Side, aka Negawatts) Key takeaways Here are my 5 takeaways, at the high level: The peak happened in the evening, and winter. Apart from a couple of early intervals, the sun had set on solar farms by the time the high prices had established themselves. Wind output was low leaving demand to be met by higher priced offers from dispatchable firming resources. Gas units appeared to price upper-end volume at higher price bands and were dispatched. Longer duration storage would have been of use to the battery fleet, to contribute more in the second high-price period. Diesel units ran and aligned with the high price periods. PS1 We didn’t cover other drivers of the high prices in this article. One key component worth mentioning at this point however (as it is related to supply of energy in SA) is the capacity of the two interconnectors to VIC. The Heywood interconnector was constrained for much of the period- constraints V_VS_LB_HY_50 and VS_050_DYN were restricting transfers into SA to below 50MW when typical capacity can be 600MW. Murraylink, the HVDC interconnector (capacity 220 MW) was on an outage. It returned to service on the 31st of July.",

    "content": "A possible repeat of yesterday evening’s high prices has commenced again on the 30 th July 2024. Yesterday’s high prices were noted at the time here on WattClarity and reflections on the rarity of the event posted by Dan Lee in “ How rare are simultaneous price spikes in all five NEM regions, like what we saw last night?” . At 17:10 This time, SA is the first region to breach 1000 $/MWh. In the 17:10 dispatch interval the SA energy price hit 3,936.60 $/MWh. In that interval renewable resources were contributing 237 MW to the market demand of 1,563 MW. Gas powered generators were making up the lion’s share. We observed the Heywood interconnector was constrained to flow at 25 MW (importing from VIC to SA) via constraint VS_050_DYN bound (dynamic headroom appeared to be actively lowering the limit to 25) meaning reduced support from VIC supply resources. At 17:45 At the time of writing, in the 17:45 interval, SA prices remain high and prices in NSW and VIC have joined the higher end (> 1,000 $/MWh). The P5 predispatch prices continue to threaten other regions. Price outlook from the 17:45 dispatch interval. Noted earlier today via X, was an outage on a VIC 500kV transmission line and low output or offline status of some VIC wind farms. At this stage, it appears the Moorabool – Mortlake No.2 500kV line was the outage referenced in the tweet above. The relevant constraint set V-MLMO (Out = Moorabool to Mortlake (MLTS-MOPS) No. 2 500 kV line) was invoked from 06:00 to 19:00 today. At 17:50 We’ve captures the state of the market using NEMWatch. NEMWatch at 17:50 At 18:00 Surely some kind of price record has been nudged? ez2view’s NEM Map at 18:00 The constraints binding for the 18:00 dispatch interval will be of interest. In this interval contingency raise (60s) hit $12,873.46 in all regions. Raise regulation in TAS reached $15,538.02.

That wasn’t the end of it though. From 19:15 until [to be confirmed, but at least until 20:15] SA prices were above 12,500 $/MWh. At 20:15 At 20:15 the SA price was 17,499.94. Earlier at 20:00 the price had hit 17,500 $/MWh – the market price cap. SA prices at 20:15, in addition to availability and demand, via ez2view.

    "title": "How rare are simultaneous price spikes in all five NEM regions, like what we saw last night?",
    "date": "30-07-2024 02:42:00 PM",
    "content": "Early yesterday evening I was deeply engrossed in the Olympics coverage when I received a string of SMS alerts notifying me of a rare occurrence of simultaneous price spikes in all five NEM regions – something that I hadn’t recalled seeing very often in my career, outside of the energy crisis in 2022. Later in the evening.. after the Men’s mountain bike race finished (spoiler alert: Tom Pidcock overcame a punctured tyre in an incredible comeback to win the gold), I fired up ez2view to have a very brief view of some of the macro-dynamics. Below I’ll share some of the over-arching factors at play last night- and then I’ll finish up by trying to answer the question that I’ve asked in the title of this article. An early look at some of the factors at play last night As I noted in my short post last night , spot prices in all five regions jumped above $1,000/MWh starting from the 17:55 dispatch interval yesterday. At the next interval, prices in each region had jumped above $3,000/MWh as shown in the screenshot below. All three mainland AC interconnectors were flowing within limit during the 18:00 dispatch interval. Source: ez2view’s NEM Map widget I’ll highlight that the QNI, VNI and Heywood interconnectors were all open (i.e. flowing within limits), whilst Basslink was flowing at its export limit for the specific interval shown. This might initially imply that the four mainland regions formed one economic island , and Tasmania formed another. However, a quick look at the AEMO’s next-day price setter data shows that a single offer from the Victorian Big Battery was involved in setting the energy price in all five regions, including Tasmania, for this interval. The price setter file for the 18:00 dispatch interval last evening. Source: ez2view’s Price Setter Data widget The joys of co-optimisation and the dispatch dynamics of Basslink make deciphering the price-setting situation in Tasmania a little trickier. I won’t delve into that in this article, but I would encourage you to read Allan O’Neil’s introduction to price-setting in the NEM , which specifically explains some of the complexities about Basslink and how inter-regional losses are calculated. Last night’s price volatility lasted for roughly one hour and was very uniform, by NEM standards. Chart shows the previous 24 hours. Source: ez2view’s Trend Editor widget On the demand side, market demand (a.k.a total demand) reached a 7-day high in every region bar TAS yesterday evening. Coincidentally, it was earlier forecast that a new all-time TAS demand record might have been on the cards, but this did not eventuate. Increased demand for heating was surely a driver to the price volatility, with a prolonged cold snap hitting the south-eastern part of the country . The second chart below shows air temperatures across the five capital cities in the NEM between Saturday and Monday. Total demand reached a one-week high in four of the five NEM regions yesterday evening. Chart shows the previous 7 days. Source: ez2view’s Trend Editor widget Air temperatures at 18:00 yesterday across the five capital cities in the NEM. Chart shows the previous 3 days. Source: ez2view’s Trend Editor widget On the supply side, one significant contributing factor was a relative lack of wind generation in the Southern regions. The chart below shows low wind production in VIC, SA, NSW and TAS coinciding with the early evening demand peak at 18:00. Worth noting that there were a number of constraint equations bound for this interval, particularly in TAS and VIC – as time permits we will attempt to have a deeper look into possible network curtailment amongst the wind fleet. Total wind generation (MW) in each of the five NEM regions. Chart shows the previous 3 days. Source: ez2view’s Trend Editor widet There were (and still remains, at the time of writing) a small number of unplanned forced outages amongst the thermal fleet, including outages at Callide Unit C3 (466 MW), Yallourn Unit 3 (405 MW), and Gladstone Unit 4 (280 MW). The long-term outage at Callide Unit C4 (466MW) is also ongoing, given that its return-to-service was recently pushed back once more . The screenshot below also shows a number of planned and unplanned deratings. Recent, current and scheduled outages for generating units in the NEM greater than 300MW, as at 18:00 yesterday evening. Ordered by Max Capacity. Source: ez2view’s Generator Outages widget How rare are NEM-wide simultaneous price spikes? Generally when the interconnector(s) between two regions is constrained/flowing at limit, regional prices on either side separate – and hence economic islands form on either side. Supply and demand in each region can vary significantly, so it’s common for multiple interconnectors to be constrained at the same time, where several economic islands form across the NEM. This is the primary reason why simultaneous price spikes in all regions are relatively rare. Another member of our team was also curious to understand how many times this had happened in the history of the NEM, so we queried our MMS database to fetch the list of all dispatch intervals where every region had a dispatch price > $1,000/MWh. The historical record shows that this had occurred numerous times between 2001 to 2007. However, interconnection dynamics in the NEM changed dramatically with the introduction of the Tasmanian region in 2005, and the abolition of the Snowy region in 2008 . As such, simultaneous price spikes of this nature have only occurred in very isolated incidences since 2007 (outside of the 2022 energy crisis ). Below is the full list of occurrences: 10 th February 2017 16:10 7 th June 2018 10:20 30 th May 2021 18:30, 18:35 21 st June 2021 17:30, 17:40 6 th July 2021 17:50 2 nd June 2022 7:00, 7:10, 17:00, 17:15, 17:20, 17:30, 17:35, 17:40, 17:45, 17:50, 17:55, 18:05, 18:10 14 th July 2022 17:25, 17:30, 17:40 29 th July 2024 17:55, 18:00, 18:05, 18:10, 18:20, 18:25, 18:30, 18:35, 18:45 So to put that into context, there have only been 32 intervals where dispatch prices were above $1,000/MWh in all five NEM regions simultaneously since 2008 – and of which, 9 of those intervals occurred last night. — With prices forecast to be up near the market cap again this evening in all five regions, we will be keeping an eye on the market again tonight to see if a repeat occurs.",

    "title": "Quarterly Reviews (for 2024 Q2) from AEMO and AER released same day … on Wednesday 24th July 2024.",
    "date": "27-07-2024 06:18:00 PM",
    "content": "The past couple weeks we’ve* had a range of people compiling our own review of the most recent quarter for GenInsights Quarterly Updates for 2024 Q2 . * as with prior iterations of this report, these are a collaborative effort between us at Global-Roam Pty Ltd and the team at Greenview Strategic Consulting . That’s what we mean here by ‘our’. In parallel with that, we noticed that Wednesday 24th July 2024 saw the release of the other two regular quarterly reviews in the triptych, which is a bit unusual (as they normally don’t land on exactly the same day) . (A) Accessing these quarterly Reports These reports are accessible as follows: AEMO Quarterly Energy Dynamics (2024 Q2) Wed 24th July 2024 AER Wholesale Markets Quarterly (2024 Q2) Wed 24th July 2024 You can download the 84-page PDF of the report here: You can download the 25-page PDF of the report here: In conjunction with the report, the AEMO published the media release ‘Wintry weather on the east coast and warmer weather in the west, led to different generation trends during the June quarter’ … which notes: [the QED] ‘… highlights the important role of flexible gas-powered generation as the ultimate backstop for the National Electricity Market (NEM) during periods of reduced renewable generation. During the June quarter, low wind speeds and reduced rainfall in the southern NEM regions saw decreases in electricity supplied from wind (-20%) and hydro (-18%), while gas (+16%) and black coal (+7%) rose, helped by increased availability of Queensland’s black coal-fired generators.’ In conjunction with the report, the AER published this summary page which notes: ‘Electricity spot prices increased in all regions except Queensland, with VWA prices ranging between $109 per MWh in Queensland to $189 per MWh in NSW. Prices increased due to a combination of higher demand, network and generator outages, and lower wind and solar output increasing the share of electricity generated by higher-priced gas and hydro.’ Worth noting that: 1) this AER quarterly report followed from the release (7 days earlier, on 17th July) of their report ‘Electricity prices above $5,000/MWh’ [during Q2] . 2) That high price review report was accompanied by the Media Release ‘AER reports on Q2 2024 high electricity price events’ . (B) News Media coverage of these three reports? On the day and afterwards, we’ve seen a range of media coverage of one, or both, of these reports. The following is what we’ve seen – if/when we come across other articles, (and if time permits) we’ll add them in here: 1) Here on WattClarity : (a) There’s this note, obviously 2) In the AFR we have seen… (a) Angela MacDonald-Smith wrote ‘Cold snap confirms energy price surge, and need for gas and coal’ early on Wednesday 24th July. 3) In the Australian we have seen … (a) Colin Packham wrote ‘Cost-of-living squeeze blow as wholesale electricity prices jump’ early on Wednesday 24th July. 4) In the Guardian we have seen … (a) Peter Hannam wrote ‘Wholesale power prices rise sharply across Australia after cold snap but Queensland bucks trend’ early on Wednesday 24th July. 5) In SMH and the Age we have seen … (a) Did not see anything in particular … but did not look closely . 6) In RenewEconomy we have seen … (a) Giles Parkinson wrote ‘Electricity prices soar thanks to costly gas, coal outages and market manipulation’ . (b) Also, Giles Parkinson wrote ‘Battery storage doubles its influence in morning and evening peaks’ . 7) In PV Magazine we have seen … (a) David Carroll wrote ‘Winter weather highlights bigger role for batteries’ . 8) In the ABC we have seen … (a) Melissa Clarke wrote ‘Winter cold spell helped drive record demand for power and spike in electricity prices across national market’ early on Wednesday 24th July. As a reader here, if you come across any other useful commentary, feel free to add as a comment (C) On Social Media… Obviously, Social Media is a rabbit hole that it’s easy to fall into – but I thought it was worth highlighting a few particularly useful contributions: 1) This note on LinkedIn by Andrew Richards (CEO of EUAA) is particularly worth reading … copied in here for convenience: ‘Despite some of the inevitable attention grabbing headlines, I think most of the reporting on the latest AEMO Quarterly Dynamics Report (Q2 2024) has been pretty fair. The same can’t be said for some commentary elsewhere where the usual special interest hobby horses have been taken for a gallop . This is very unhelpful. The report itself identifies a number of factors driving wholesale prices including the variously described renewable energy “drought” and the key role of batteries and gas (as opposed to batteries or gas). Price volatility events, AKA generator outages and generator re-bidding (also identified recently by the AER) are also highlighted. Of great interest to energy nerds is the role that transmission outages, in this case mostly planned, is having on wholesale prices . In an energy system that is increasingly disbursed, it is becoming almost impossible to schedule planned maintenance without causing a significant market impact . This will become a bigger problem as more centralised generation is withdrawn and more decentralised generation is installed. It seems that in the very near future no matter what piece of the transmission system you de-energise for maintenance you will impact 1,000’s of MW of generation capacity. Do we need some new guidelines or market rules about generator (or in the near future large scale batteries) re-bidding during planned network outages? One way or another a solution needs to be found. The practical, physical and technical challenges are mounting up and it is clear much more work is needed (and probably money spent) i f we are to reach a net zero energy system. It is unhelpful to ignore this or to wish it away, we just need to do the work.’ … I have highlighted a couple points that particularly resonate to me. 2) Earlier today, Ketan Joshi made a salient point here on LinkedIn that I’d (also) not seen anyone else note …copied here for convenience: ‘The fact that the first real rise in power sector emissions doesn’t even make it into the report summary, let alone a single piece of media coverage , of the latest Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) quarterly report speaks volumes. Some of this is down to an abnormally low-wind year, but private corporate investment in clean power has unsurprisingly waned … ’ Will add other comments, if we come across them (and they resonate",

    "title": "A tale of two mega-projects: Project Energy Connect and Snowy 2.0 timelines (Part 2)",
    "date": "24-07-2024 02:05:00 PM",
    "content": "Last week I posted Part 1 of this two-part examination of mega-projects in the NEM. In that article, I published a history of estimates surrounding the costs, benefits, and delivery dates for Project Energy Connect (PEC). In Part 2 here, I’ll focus on Snowy 2.0 – a very different mega-project, but similarly, facing delays and other difficulties. I’ll close out this analysis with some bigger-picture takeaways about the history of large-scale construction and investment in the NEM. Snowy 2.0 The original Snowy Mountains Scheme, ex post facto ‘Snowy 1.0’, was developed between 1949 and 1972. It included the construction of 7 hydro power facilities, 16 dams, 80km of aqueducts and 145km of tunnels to divert water from the Snowy and Tumut rivers. It is considered the largest engineering project completed in the history of Australia. Plans to connect two dams from the original scheme – Tantangara and Talbingo – had been discussed in the decades after, as the 680m difference in elevation between the two dams represented a gross head difference ideal for a pumped hydro facility. The main complexity with the project undertaking was the 20+ km of tunnelling and deep cavern needed, spanning varying geological conditions ( originally surveyed as twelve main rock types and eight faults). Geological, geotechnical and hydrological conditions for Snowy 2.0 Source: Snowy 2.0 Feasibility Study The project was eventually dubbed ‘Snowy 2.0’, and was officially announced by Malcolm Turnbull in March 2017. Below is a tabulated timeline of major milestones and events since that announcement. Date Event 2017-03-16 Then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced that the government would fund and proceed with the Snowy 2.0 project. Whilst no feasibility study had yet taken place, it was widely reported that the government’s initial estimate of cost was $2b, with an expected four-year delivery timeline. 2017-12-20 The official feasibility study was published. The base case estimate of final cost is projected to be between $3.8 to $4.5b. The full cost and economic modelling sections of the report are omitted from the public release, but the executive summary states “work confirms that the benefits of the Project exceed the expected cost of the Project by a substantial margin.” 2018-03-02 The Federal Government purchased the New South Wales government’s 58% stake, and the Victorian government’s 29% stake in Snowy Hydro – for a combined sum of $6.2b. 2018-12-12 The Snowy Hydro board formally approved the Snowy 2.0 project , confirming a Final Investment Decision to proceed. 2019-01-18 Snowy Hydro appointed preferred tenderers , including Clough Engineering, Future Generation and Salini Impregilo (later renamed Webuild). 2019-02-28 Scott Morrison announced that the project had been approved for commonwealth funding , early works began shortly after this announcement. 2020-06-30 Snowy 2.0 received environmental approval, the last major part of the project’s approval process. 2021-03-19 The first of three Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM), nicknamed ‘Lady Eileen Hudson’ was commissioned . It is expected to bore the main access and tailrace tunnel (a total of 7.9km). 2021-12-06 The second TBM, nicknamed ‘Kirsten’, was commissioned . It is expected to bore the emergency, cable and ventilation tunnel, inclined pressure shaft, and a section of the headrace tunnel (a total of 6.7km). Source: Snowy Hydro 2022-03-22 The third TBM, nicknamed ‘Florence’, was commissioned . It is expected to bore the headrace tunnel (a total of 14.9km). 2022-08-21 The Australian reported $2.2b worth of cost variation claims from several Snowy 2.0 contractors. The COVID-19 pandemic and surges in material costs are cited as reasons for the claims. 2022-10-11 Snowy Hydro announced that TBM Lady Eileen Hudson had now completed the 2.9km main access tunnel (the first tunnel of the scheme completed). 2022-11-08 The Federal Government confirmed final approval for the 330kV double-circuit transmission lines to the power station. 2022-12-06 Major contractor, Clough Engineering, was placed in voluntary administration . The company was eventually acquired by Webuild in February 2023. 2023-02-12 A surface hole appeared above TBM Florence. Some media outlets report that Florence was stuck, whilst the then-Interim CEO, Roger Whitby, later stated that the machine was not physically stuck in rock, but rather was idle whilst structural reinforcing works were needed. Satellite images later revealed that Florence had only completed 150m of its 14.9km planned journey when movement was halted. Source: Peter Anderson 2023-04-22 The AFR and ABC report that on-site work was temporarily halted due to the death of a subcontract worker. The man’s truck crashed, rolled and caught fire on the Snowy Mountains Highway whilst transporting cement. 2023-08-23 ABC aired an episode of Four Corners that claimed Snowy 2.0 workers were exposed to toxic gas in July 2023, identified as isocyanate, and that the company did not disclose this to the public at the time. Source: ABC 2023-08-31 In a lengthy project update , Snowy Hydro announced a revised $12b cost, a 200MW increase in final capacity, and a new expected completion date of December 2028. 2023-12-13 After roughly 12 months without movement, Florence resumed tunnelling works . 2024-01-05 Snowy Hydro announced that excavation work had been completed on the 223m transformer hall cavern crown . 2024-05-04 ABC reported of a partial collapse of the Main Access Tunnel (which completed boring in October 2022) due to drill and blast operations in the main cavern. Snowy Hydro later clarified that the collapse was expected, but occurred earlier than planned. Source: ABC 2024-05-16 The cutting head for Florence had become wedged in hard rock whilst navigating a curve. High-pressure water jets had been brought in to remove rock pinching on the machine’s shield. Florence had completed approximately 850m of the 14.9km headrace tunnel at this update. 2024-07-11 After seven weeks without movement, Snowy Hydro announced that Florence had restarted excavation. Table 1: Timeline of major events and disruptions to Snowy 2.0 The next table lists the estimated cost and completion date for Snowy 2.0 from official sources, as they have evolved since the project was first announced.

Where an estimated cost or delivery time was given as a range, the upper estimate is shown in the table. Expected capital cost does not include related transmission upgrades. Table 2: Changes to official estimates of cost and completion. The NEM and mega-projects PEC and Snowy 2.0 are very different projects. PEC went through the RIT-T process, and the project is complex in terms of the physical length of the transmission path, and the need to coordinate the project through two jurisdictions. Meanwhile, Snowy 2.0 was a captain’s call by the Turnbull government, and is a very complex project from a geological engineering standpoint. Despite this, there are commonalities, and they go beyond just these two projects. For example: Basslink was first proposed to be operational by late 2003 at a cost of $500m, as records from the Tasmanian treasury show . The project eventually came in at a cost of $877m , and was connected in December 2005 . Basslink underperformed financial expectations and eventually, the cable’s ownership company was placed into voluntary administration in November 2021. Not in the NEM, but close to home – Mike Cannon-Brookes’ proposed SunCable was originally projected to begin construction in 2023, be energised by 2026, and deliver $8b in benefits to the NT economy. The project has faced its own internal tug-of-war , and now the most recent company statement hopes for FID in 2027, and energisation in the early 2030s. The Borumba Pumped Hydro Project announced by the Queensland state government in September 2022, is proposed to be one of the largest PHES facilities in the world. It was originally expected to be completed by June 2030, but as of the latest ESOO update, had already seen a 15-month delay. Basslink: Modelled benefits in the final business case vs Measured benefits between FY 2006 to FY 2011. Key Takeaways, and Further Reading Large-scale government-initiated projects unlock many smaller privately-funded projects. In the case of transmission, this can be in terms of actual project approvals – but in a more holistic sense, many of these mega-projects eventually play a role in enhancing investor appetite and ensuring long-term confidence in reliability. This is just one reason why projected benefits for these projects are difficult to measure and model. This is a fact that is often ignored by those who criticise these large undertakings. And, immeasurable benefits may also be a contributing factor as to why governments consistently underestimate costs in order to get proposals over the line. But conversely, these under-estimations eventually have compounding negative impacts on investor confidence and market sentiment when they are delayed (or delivered over-budget), as there are nested effects for the individual projects that hang on their completion. — Whilst piecing together this analysis, a member of our team suggested that I read Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner’s book ‘How Big Things Get Done’ , which was released last year. The authors have collated a database of 16,000+ major engineering projects around the world, and conclude that 92% of these projects were delivered over-budget, or over-schedule, or both. The authors draw observations from their experiences in analysing these projects. I would recommend others to read the book to form their own opinions, but below are some of my key learnings that may have parallels to the NEM: The value of modularity. From their research, the authors find that the least over-budget and least over-schedule project types by a comfortable margin were.. solar farms, followed by.. wind farms. The reasoning they state is that there are less unknowns and less variables in ‘cookie-cutter’ style projects. Some in the NEM expect the same to hold true for big battery projects, but this is yet to be seen . Eternal beginner syndrome. The authors state that every summer and winter Olympic games since 1960 has been delivered over-budget. They argue that the four-year Olympic cycle (new host city, new hosting committee, new key decision-makers, etc.) means that the Olympics are “ forever planned for by beginners” . I could argue that the same could be said of federal or state government-initiated mega-projects. The perils of optimism. This was the main takeaway I stated in Part 1 , but the authors have put it in better words than myself “You want the flight attendant, not the pilot, to be an optimist… What you need from your pilot is hard-nosed analysis that sees reality as clearly as possible”.",

Commenced on 6th June 2024 … which we noted soon after in ‘Gas-fired generation running more strongly in TAS (and Tamar Valley CCGT for the first time) than it has over the past 5 years’ . ii. Crossed through 11th July, which was when we marked 5 weeks of solid operations ; and iii. Ended Tuesday 23rd July 2024, almost 40 days after the operations commenced. (b) We see that output was almost fully ‘flat out’ at its Maximum Capacity – driven by bidding at or below $0/MWh (i.e. the blue ranges). 2) At the bottom we see a filtered view of ‘Generator Outages’ widget looking just at TAS gas-fired units. This shows: (a) a Planned Outage was slated to commence (as at the 18:00 data update yesterday) at least as early as this Sunday 28th July (b) but note that the MT PASA DUID Availability data for days prior to Sunday is now stale (last updated for 18:00 on Saturday 20th July), so it’s possible this outage has commenced sooner. 3) Indeed, not shown in the image above: (a) Accessing the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget we see that the plan has been (since about 25th June) that the unit would run until the end of July; (b) Pulling up the ‘Bid Table’ in the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget shown above, we see: i. The unit tripped offline yesterday; and ii. Then there was a rebid yesterday by Hydro Tasmania with ‘Change in outage schedule: TVCC201 & Tungatinah #2 + correct error +SLOW>180’ as rebid reason. … so perhaps the plan changed slightly with the trip to start the outage earlier? For the complete picture, here’s a view over the same time span of all gas-fired units in TAS: Between all the units, there’s been a solid block of production from gas-fired generation (to cater for the cold-induced demand in the presence of low hydro levels and low wind) for at least the 60 days shown.",

    "title": "A tale of two mega-projects: Project Energy Connect and Snowy 2.0 timelines (Part 1)",
    "date": "16-07-2024 07:15:00 AM",
    "content": "Project Energy Connect, Snowy 2.0, Borumba, Basslink, Central Queensland Hydrogen Hub, Marinus Link, Pioneer-Burdekin, Copperstring – the NEM has its share of past, present, and proposed mega-projects, showcasing both promise and peril. In the past week, several news articles have highlighted ongoing issues surrounding the construction of Project Energy Connect (PEC), drawing parallels to the challenges faced by Snowy 2.0 in recent years. Given these similarities, I thought it would be useful to collate a timeline of both projects to understand how three key aspects of each of these projects have evolved over time: 1) expected cost, 2) expected benefits, and 3) expected delivery date. Project Energy Connect An interconnector between SA and NSW (then-named Riverlink) was originally approved in principle by the SA Government in December 1997 at a projected all-in cost of $95m. The original proposal included a new 275kV line between Robertstown (SA) and Buronga (NSW). However, with the privatisation of the Electricity Trust of South Australia in 1999, the Riverlink project was effectively scrapped. Riverlink Original Proposal, December 1997 Source: SA Department of Premier and Cabinet In June 2016, then-Premier of South Australia, Jay Weatherill, announced a partially state government-funded feasibility study to revive the Riverlink interconnector proposal, amidst a trend of increasing wholesale prices . In September of that year, SA experienced its now-infamous state-wide blackout , which fuelled concerns over the state’s energy security, and specifically, about the region’s ability to navigate interconnector separation events from VIC. An initial cost-benefit assessment as part of the RIT-T process was eventually published by ElectraNet in June 2018 , and ultimately detailed four options for consideration: no new interconnector . Instead this option included several new support agreements, two new batteries, and FCAS enablement on Murraylink. HVDC interconnection to QLD connecting Port Augusta (SA) to Western Downs (QLD). Several variations of HV AC and DC interconnection to NSW in several different configurations and capacities. A new HVAC interconnection path to VIC connecting Tungkillo (SA) to Ballarat (VIC). A variation of the SA-NSW interconnector was identified by the report as the preferred choice – this specific option consisted of a new 900km HVAC line between Robertstown (SA) and Wagga Wagga (NSW). The project was eventually given the new name ‘Project Energy Connect’. Below is a tabulated timeline of milestones and events concerning PEC. Date Event 2016-06-14 The SA Government announced a new feasibility study for an SA-NSW interconnector, citing increasing wholesale electricity prices. In the announcement, then-treasurer Tom Koutsantonis stated that an initial cost estimates for a proposed interconnector were in early stages, but ranged “between $300m to $700m” . 2016-09-28 South Australia experienced the now infamous state-wide system black event . 2016-11-01 A RIT-T Project Consultation Report was published by ElectraNet outlining that four credible interconnector options would be assessed. 2018-06-29 ElectraNet published their RIT-T Draft Assessment Report , with the finding that a 330kV line connecting Robertstown and Wagga Wagga was the preferred option at an estimated cost of $1.52b. 2019-02-13 The RIT-T Final Assessment Report was released, confirming the Robertstown-Wagga Wagga line as the preferred option. ElectraNet concludes that net market benefits are expected to be $900m over 21 years (in present value terms). 2020-12-18 The AER published its preliminary position on PEC , but was unable to make a final determination as neither Transgrid nor ElectraNet had committed to the project. In their preliminary assessment, the AER reduced the projected cost of the project by 9%, to $2.15b. 2021-02-04 The AEMC rejected an urgent rule change request from ElectraNet and Transgrid, that would have assisted PEC to secure necessary debt financing. 2021-05-31 The AER published their final determination , giving the project a green light at a proposed cost of $2.28b. The CEFC announced that they had facilitated the project with a $295m ‘subordinated note instrument’. Several media outlets reported that the project was unlikely to proceed without the CEFC’s intervention. 2021-06-02 Clough Engineering and Elecnor were awarded the EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) contract for the New South Wales (Transgrid) portion of PEC, through a new joint-venture enterprise, SecureEnergy. SecureEnergy was later renamed Elecnor Australia. 2021-10-08 Downer were awarded the EPC contract for the South Australian (ElectraNet) portion of PEC. 2022-12-06 Clough Engineering was placed in voluntary administration . The company was eventually acquired by Webuild in February 2023. 2023-12-21 ElectraNet announced that the South Australian side of the transmission line had been completed. The SA portion makes up 206 km of the near-900 km line. 2024-01-24 In their annual report released in January 2024 , Elecnor, cited COVID-related execution delays, rises in prices for raw materials, labour, and logistics as factors behind negative margins on their Australian projects. 2024-05-21 In the May 2024 update of the 2023 ESOO, the AEMO highlighted an official one-year delay to the final completion of the project. Stage 1 (a 150MW transfer capacity) is expected for November 2024. 2024-07-10 A second engineering contractor, Downer, is added to the Transgrid portion of the project after original engineering contractor, Elecnor, defaulted on parts of its contractual obligations.

Where an estimated cost was given as a range, the upper estimate is shown in the table. Table 2: Changes to official estimates of cost and completion. No official update to the project’s total cost appears to have been made public since the final determination in May 2021. In the initial assessment published in June 2018, ‘avoided fuel costs’ made up the largest share of projected market benefits from PEC (in the central scenario), and were predicted to begin from mid-2023. The modelled market benefits (central scenario) of the original iteration of PEC from June 2018, which assumed completion by July 2023. Source: ElectraNet Project Assessment Report Draft June 2018 Other market benefits such as reduction in generator capital and fixed costs, avoided REZ transmission capital expenditure, etc. were also projected. Estimated market benefits from each of the assessed interconnector options, from February 2019. Source: ElectraNet Project Assessment Final Report February 2019 Key Takeaway Industry veterans appear trained to be skeptical of any estimate of cost or delivery time of these mega-projects. Upon the AER’s approval of PEC in 2021 for $2.28b, Grattan Institute’s Tony Wood colourfully put it “Anyone who thinks it’s going to get built for what they are saying it will be, has rocks in their heads.” Of course, it’s an inherently impossible task to accurately model and predict the total cost and delivery time for any long-dated large complex engineering project. But erring on the side of optimism can risk harm to investor appetite. And in particular, a greater concern is that delays to critical infrastructure could create potential domino effects for parts of the development industry. In Part 2 I will publish a similar timeline for the Snowy 2.0 project, and provide further takeaways from examining the evolving expectations surrounding both projects.",

    "content": "When you see a news article about a ‘ ferocious Tasman Low’ such as in Ben Domensino’s article ‘Ferocious Tasman Low to hit southeast Australia next week’ yesterday, it’s hard not to open and have a look! Given (as we wrote years ago in the GRC2018 ) that the NEM is ‘increasingly dependent on the weather’ I assume we’re not alone in paying increasing attention to information such as this. From Ben’s article we wondered: 1) The forecast is for cold weather … how will this affect ‘ Market Demand ’? 2) The forecast high winds (albeit moreso offshore) might deliver higher wind yield . … but in the light of ongoing use of gas in gas-fired generation (such as Tamar Valley CCGT these past 5 weeks ) and concerns raised by some about gas storage levels at Iona and production levels at Longford (such as discussed by Colin Packham here ), I thought I’d quickly access this trend chart from ez2view to look at forecast levels of ‘ Market Demand ’ and NEM-wide IRPM for the coming week: Short story is: 1) Some similarities for the coming week as we saw on Tuesday 2nd July and Wednesday 3rd July; 2) As in, ‘ Market Demand ’ at evening peak up around 22,500MW 3) But we see the forecast forward is that: (a) NEM-wide IRPM for Monday 15th July, Tuesday 16th July and Wednesday 17th July forecast not even to drop below 20%; whilst (a) NEM-wide IRPM for Thursday 18th July forecast to drop (just) below 20%; (c) but not even to the levels of Tuesday 2nd July and Wednesday 3rd July (and certainly not to the lower points seen in June).",

    "title": "Final figures for wind production through 2024 Q2",
    "date": "09-07-2024 06:08:00 PM",
    "content": "I’ve been away for over a week, during which time we’ve seen the end of 2024 Q2 … and, catching up on market news today, I’ve seen ongoing commentary about the wind lull through the quarter (amongst many other topics of conversation). So, before moving onto other things, I thought it would be worth drawing a line through the quarter with these two updates: (A) Updated long-run stats for NEM-wide wind production We’ve been progressively updating these long-term wind production statistics , so I thought it would be useful to start with this update via NEMreview v7 : For those with a licence to this software, you can open your own copy of this trend query here . It’s clear from this trend that the aggregate production levels through 2024 Q2 were the worst since 2017 Q2 (i.e. 7 years ago) . Some stats on a monthly basis have been added as annotations … if time permitted we’d aggregate them further to quarters, but that will have to wait (e.g. such as in GenInsights Quarterly Updates for 2024 Q2 ). (B) Finalised ‘worm line’ On 1st June 2024 we published ‘More detail on the poor wind yield through (most of!) April and May 2024’ containing 5 ‘worm line’ trends for cumulative production from wind farms across the NEM through April and May of 5 most recent years. 1) Then on 22nd June we extended the ‘worm line’ trend into the month of June (at that point) in the article ‘Where’s the wind gone, through 2024 Q2? … with June perhaps even worse than April or May!’ 2) In that article I’d written … … ‘In aggregate terms, eyeballing the chart it should be relatively easy to see that 2024 might be as much as 3,000,000MWh ‘short’ of wind production through 2024 Q2 compared to what some might have expected’ 3) Since that time I’ve seen a few others reference that and (unfortunately) overlook the first use of ‘might’ in the sentence – hence perhaps taking out of context as a forecast from us, rather than a reasoned lower bound. As it turns out, the wind picked up from around that point through to the end of the month, as a result of which the completed ‘worm line’ chart for 2024 Q2 concludes as follows: Still a remarkably low result for the quarter: 1) Lower, in absolute terms, then both: (a) 2023 Q2 … despite over 1,000MW of additional capacity (and diversity of installations); (b) 2022 Q2 … despite just under 1,500MW of additional capacity (and diversity of installations); 2) Somewhat up on 2021 Q2 … but nowhere near where we might expect it to be with more than 2,500MW of additional capacity (and diversity of installations) (C) A reminder … different factors can affect low wind output. Worth repeating the reminder that these charts show aggregate output of wind farms collectively. In reviewing these results, readers should be aware that this output could have been affected by any (or all) of the following factors: Factor #1 – lulls in the wind resource There’s definitely been some of this at work in 2024 (e.g. persistent blocking high pressure systems) … but is it the only factor? Factor #2 – plant unavailability It’s possible that some wind farms might be experiencing poor plant availability, which would impact … but how would we actually know that? (a) Since 7th August 2023 the Semi-Scheduled operators have been able to use MaxAvail in the bid to quickly reflect situations such as plant unavailability. Through the remainder of 2023 we saw that many DUIDs did utilise this capability . i. At this point we have not checked to see how much of this was active through 2024 Q2 ii. But we’re also conscious that, even if we did, the same visibility is not there for prior Q2 periods (so comparing to some historical precedent would not be possible). (b) However there’s still not complete clarity about physical issues onsite at the Semi-Scheduled units, as the AEMC neglected to extend the responsibilities stemming from ‘ the ERM Rule Change ‘ to Semi-Scheduled units (as we’ve written concerns about several times before, such as here ). Factor #3 – spillage It’s possible that some wind farms might also been spilling available energy through one or more of the Q2 periods … if so, that would not be visible in the above. There are numerous articles written here about curtailment of VRE, with some particularly useful ones collated under the ‘Curtailment of VRE’ category . Remember that ‘spillage’ or ‘curtailment’ might due to several reasons, including two big ones: Factor 3a = spillage for Economic Reasons In simple terms, ‘Economic Curtailment’ occurs when the unit does not like the spot price (e.g. it’s below their ‘negative LGC’ break even price) and so they switch off i. since the AER Rule Change , this was clarified that it needs to happen only through their bids. ii. However (particularly later through Q2) my sense has been more middle-of-the-day prices at very healthy levels, so I would not expect that there would have been much Economic Curtailment in recent weeks. 1. Last week Dan published this more methodical review of 2024 Q4 prices . 2. This showed a reasonable number of instances of negative prices (in some regions higher than any other Q2 periods) … but we also note that the lowest points were typically above -$100/MWh (so perhaps not lower than ‘negative LGC’ on many occasions to trigger ‘Economic Curtailment’ at any assets … we’d need to look in more detail to see for each wind farm!) Factor 3b = spillage due to Network Constraints … in other words, they are being ‘constrained down’ because of localised situations in the network (or sometimes broader reasons, like System Strength constraints). That’s all for now…",

We’ll need to wait for further information from AEMO to really know. 2) In Alex Cowie’s comment below , he points to this RenewEconomy article ‘Load shedding in NSW holiday spot after multiple transmission line trips’ which includes the following additional information: ‘Around 24,000 customers in northern NSW around Byron Bay went without power for more than an hour on Monday night after one of the main transmission lines tripped, causing the market operator to call for load shedding to keep the network stable. A spokesman for the Australian Energy Market Operator said Transgrid’s 330 kV Lismore to Coffs Harbour line tripped earlier in the day, and load shedding was needed to secure network from soon after 6pm. Essential Energy had to cut off power for about 24,000 customers in the area around Byron Bay, Lismore and Ballina after AEMO instructed Transgrid to shed a total of 40 megawatts of load.’ etc… 3) There are also other comments on this LinkedIn update that was triggered when our article was first published. i.

    "content": "After a lull in the winds this week, wind power is set to pick up from rock bottom as a rare easterly wind surge impacts Qld, NSW and SA. Wind power has been slack this week across the National Electricity Market (NEM) in response to a stubborn high-pressure system which has parked itself over the Bight. Image: Mean Sea Level Pressure (MSLP) at 10am on Friday, July 5 This high will continue to sit over the Bight and Tas, until it finally moves east into the Tasman Sea on Monday, July 8. The image below shows that we saw low wind power in the order of 30 to 60 GWh/day in response to this high earlier this week, but wind has picked up slightly to 100 GWh/day on Thursday, July 4. Image: Wind contribution to generation (GW) during the last 30 days leading up to Thursday, July 4. Source: OpenNEM Usually with high pressure sitting over the Bight, wind power should continue to be low into next week. However, the images below show a rare easterly wind surge elevating winds slightly across parts of Qld, NSW and SA from Friday and possibly Vic on Monday. ﻿ Images: Instantaneous wind gust forecast between Friday, July 5 and Thursday, July 11 While it is common for easterly winds to move over Australia, it is the strength of the wind that is unusual. The strongest winds over southern Australia, typically originate from the north or south, while for the east coast, westerly winds are typically the strongest. These winds are normally associated with cold fronts sweeping over the country. This weekend we will see easterly winds strengthen as they feed into a cut of low over SA cradled by a high-pressure system in the Bight. The easterly wind surge will not match the strength of winds associated with cold fronts, so wind power will remain low to medium across Qld, NSW and SA. The image below shows that the wind farm output across the NEM should increase ever so slightly in the coming days, compared to the very low winds we saw earlier this week. Image: Weatherzone’s Opticast Wind Farm Output for the NEM from Friday, July 5 to Friday, July 12. The stronger easterly winds in these states, will also be accompanied by a thick northeasterly cloudband stretching from the Coral Sea down to SA. You can see in the image below that it has already begun thickening up and producing rainfall in these areas. Image: Himawari-9 satellite image at 11:50am AEST on Friday, July 5 This cloudband is likely to reduce solar output in these states between Friday and early next week. So, when is decent wind power coming? You can see in the image above wind power is forecast to increase above 150 GWh day later next week in the NEM, with strong cold front finally able to make its way across southern Australia.

    "title": "A bounce back: a review of Q2 2024 prices",
    "date": "04-07-2024 11:10:00 PM",
    "content": "“Q2 is the new Q1” , or so it’s been said in recent years. In the first decade and a half of the NEM, the second quarter of the calendar year was typically a very uneventful period – characterised by relatively mild demand and post-summer scheduled outages for the (then predominantly thermal) generation fleet. There were some deviations from the norm in 2013 and 2014, largely driven by the short-lived emissions trading scheme/carbon tax. However, it was really in 2016 that this paradigm began to change with, what we called at the time , a ‘remarkable’ shift in price outcomes. In hindsight, that quarter looks less and less remarkable with each new year, but it did signify a turning of the tide as we have since seen increasing volatility with each new Q2. This held true again in Q2 2024, with at least four main drivers this time around: Several wind lulls that formed a ‘wind drought’, dampening wind production particularly in SA, VIC and NSW . Scheduled network outages, impacting a number of generators, particularly in NSW . Machinations in the gas market, with an extended outage at Longford impacting gas production (although it’s likely that other more structural factors are at play in the gas market). Dryer-than-usual weather, lowering hydro production particularly in TAS. In this 2024 review of Q2 prices, an annual tradition here on WattClarity , I won’t focus too much on these drivers but focus rather on the shape and high-level statistics for spot prices in each region so we can compare to previous Q2s. Region-by-Region Queensland We will begin with the QLD region. Despite the title of this article, this was the region to show the least ‘bounce’ compared to last year’s Q2 price outcomes. In fact, QLD was the only one of the five NEM regions where time-weighted average prices were down from Q2 last year. Also worth noting, that this coincided with a rise in the number of negative price intervals year-on-year. As we see below, the duration curve followed a generally similar shape as to 2023, but diverged at the $100/MWh mark, and under. This year’s duration curve in QLD repeated a somewhat similar shape to 2023. Time-weighted average prices were down by $25/MWh. to $101/MWh compared to Q2 2023. Source: NEMreview The four drivers mentioned at the beginning of the article are likely to have had a smaller impact in the QLD region this quarter. We should also keep in mind that Queensland’s climate means that it is a strong summer-peaking region – hence colder temperatures in May and June (like we’ve seen this year) have less of a seasonal impact on demand than in more southern states – although weather outcomes generally tend to diverge between northern and southern regions regardless. New South Wales The duration curve for NSW revealed fewer incidences of negative prices, compared to QLD. Overall, NSW experienced a rise in time-weighted average prices (by $36/MWh compared to last year) to $173/MWh over the quarter. Time-weighted average prices were up $36/MWh, to $173/MWh, compared to Q2 2023 in NSW. Source: NEMreview Whilst QLD did not experience a single instance of prices spiking above $1,000/MWh, NSW had several intervals when the spot price jumped to or close to the market cap this quarter. Limits to flows on VNI, intra-regional network constraints (particularly the ‘ N::N_CTYS_2 ’ constraint equation), cold temperatures, and low wind, all played a role. As we noted at the time, the most significant period of high prices occurred in early May (where we saw price spikes on May 2nd , 3rd , 7th and 8th ) where network constraints south-west of Sydney were a significant contributing factor. This eventuated with the region hitting the Cumulative Price Threshold (CPT) on the evening of May 8th and entering administered pricing for approximately one week. Victoria The duration curve in VIC for Q2 2024 sloped sharply around the $100-200/MWh range, compared to Q2 last year. Time-weighted average prices in VIC also increased to their second highest level ($127/MWh) since the start of the NEM, second only to the energy crisis of 2022. Although these averages were up, the maximum price in VIC this quarter did not go above the $1,000/MWh mark notably. The left side of the duration curve was significantly higher this year in VIC. Time-weighted average prices were up $38/MWh in VIC compared to Q2 2023. Source: NEMreview In a historical context, both the duration curve and trended stats show price outcomes in Q2 2024 that were more pronounced than Q2 2017 – which some will remember was an especially dicey quarter as the region was beset with the, relatively sudden, closure of Hazelwood . In terms of underlying drivers, I noted last week that VIC was one of the regions where the supply stack was most impacted by a number of wind lulls that occurred in Q2. Cold temperatures and gas market spillovers are also likely to have played a role – particularly with low evening temperatures in mid-June contributing to a run of supply-demand tightness, that was felt NEM-wide. South Australia It was a similar story in SA, with the duration curve sloping sharper, higher and slightly further to the left compared to 2023. Unlike VIC, it is notable that SA saw some incidences of >$1000/MWh prices. Time-weighted average prices in SA were up $11/MWh, to $135/MWh, compared to Q2 2023. Source: NEMreview As Linton noted at the time , there was a prolonged run of elevated prices in SA in the early evening of June 4th where we saw prices peak at $3,936/MWh. On that evening, Linton noted that limits on the Heywood interconnector and light wind conditions were likely contributing factors for this run of high prices. The region also saw more isolated price spikes on June 6th and June 18th , with the spot price hitting the market cap on the evening of the latter. Tasmania It was an eventful quarter in TAS, with the predominately-hydro region plagued by dry conditions. Time-weighted average prices in TAS more than doubled from Q2 2023, to $131/MWh. The shape of the TAS duration curve diverged significantly compared to Q2 2023. Time-weighted average prices in TAS were up by $67/MWh (to $131/MWh) compared to Q2 2023. Source: NEMreview Excluding the 2022 energy crisis, this quarter saw the highest time-weighted average prices experienced in TAS for a Q2 – higher than 2016, which was on the back end of the Tasmanian energy crisis (which included a six-month outage of Basslink). As Paul noted last month, gas-fired generation ran particularly strongly this June , including a rare run of the Tamar Valley Gas Power Station (the first time it had run in roughly 5 years). Western Australia Although we tend to stick to commentary and analysis of the NEM here on WattClarity, for completeness is the Q2 duration curve and trended stats for WA. The data has been extracted from our NEMreview software (which currently only has WEM data back to 2017). As expected, price outcomes in the WEM diverge significantly from the five NEM regions, owing to its distinct and fundamentally different market design characteristics. Time-weighted average prices in WA decreased by $9/MWh compared to last year, to $79/MWh. Source: NEMreview Worth noting here that a suite of extensive reform initiatives were implemented in the WEM in October 2023 , hence this is the first Q2 since these market changes. Summary The chart below is the summarised view of time-weighted average prices across all five NEM regions and WA. Time-weighted average prices bounced back higher for four of the five NEM regions compared to Q2 2023. Source: NEMreview. I labelled last year’s edition of this review “after the storm” to reflect a quarter where prices had decreased significantly year-on-year following the 2022 energy crisis, but were still trending upwards over a longer time horizon. As this year’s review appears to demonstrate a continuation of this increasing long-term trend, we’ve seen something of “a bounce back” . For historical consistency with our previous reviews, the next three charts are displayed in terms of half-hour intervals (the average of the six 5-minute dispatch prices each half-hour), as we’ve been conducting this analysis for a number of years prior to the introduction of 5-minute settlement. These charts show the number of incidences of half-hour periods where prices were >$1,000/MWh, >$300/MWh, and ≤$0/MWh in each region. Although incidences of >$1,000/MWh prices increased slightly in NSW, and TAS year-on-year, these incidence are down on the whole compared to years 2021 to 2023. Source: NEMreview We can see the long-term trend of >$1,000/MWh price incidences is dominated by one-off events – the extreme price volatility that is expected (and economists would argue necessary) in an energy-only market like the NEM. Although there was a slight increase year-on-year in NSW and TAS, in general, we saw less of these extreme price occurrences compared to the previous three years. The next chart shows the incidences of prices above $300/MWh (i.e. the price of a traditional cap contract), and shows mixed outcomes compared to 2023 across the regions, but still generally more incidences compared to 2021 and prior. Incidences of >$300/MWh prices increased in TAS, NSW, and VIC, compared to Q2 2023. Source: NEMreview. And finally, we see a continuation of the long-term trend of increasing negative prices in Q2. Although the number of negative price intervals decreased sharply in SA and VIC (owing to the several wind lulls in those two regions throughout Q2), negative prices still occurred more frequently than all Q2s prior to 2023 in every region, bar TAS. Incidences of negative prices increased in WA, QLD, and NSW and decreased sharply in SA and VIC compared to Q2 2023. The long-term trend shows a continuing rise. Source: NEMreview. Key Takeaways This was a pure price analysis of Q2 with relatively little exploration of the underlying drivers, although we have had coverage of these on WattClarity in recent months. There are still several notable insights and trends worth highlighting from this data exploration: Q2 2024 price outcomes showed somewhat of a QLD vs the rest divide. From what we’ve mentioned previously on WattClarity, the key prices drivers this last quarter appear to have impacted the sunshine state relatively less, with it being the only NEM region where time-weighted average prices declined compared to Q2 2023. Despite a relative lack of extreme prices incidences (i.e. spot prices >$1,000/MWh) compared to recent years, average prices trended upward in four of the five regions. Negative price intervals were down in VIC, SA, and TAS this year – but are still generally trending upwards. Despite what some might consider transient or short-term events driving price outcomes in Q2 2024, the long-run trend of increasing Q2 price volatility continues.",

    "title": "A running view of the recent wind drought",
    "date": "26-06-2024 03:50:00 PM",
    "content": "Wind generation has once again been making headlines over the past few weeks, on two different fronts: From the outside looking in, we’ve seen several stories in the mainstream media regarding the public opposition facing several proposed wind projects. Notably, seen through a Four Corners episode titled ‘ The Wind Wars ’ two weeks ago. In a similar vein, a widely-read article in the Conversation , penned by several academics, raised concerns over the biodiversity impacts of several proposed wind farms in Queensland. From the inside looking out, the NEM’s existing wind fleet has been grappling with a rather consequential ‘wind drought’ since April. It has been tracked closely here on WattClarity , with additional coverage by the AFR and RenewEconomy. The two issues are unrelated in the short-term, but are important to consider in tandem in the long-term, especially in light of the AEMO’s Integrated System Plan (2024 ISP) released earlier today. A closer inspection of Q2’s wind yield may offer a real-world glimpse into the challenges facing our current electricity system, mid-transition. Where we are Throughout Q2, we’ve observed several instances of supply-demand tightness in the electricity market. Several factors have been at play, including multiple prolonged wind lulls. Compared to recent years, we’ve additionally seen cold temperatures driving increased heating demand, relatively low production from hydro , and increased production from coal . The latter two factors are likely to have resulted in an increase in net emissions when compared to previous second quarters. Our annual analysis of Q2 prices in coming weeks will examine economic outcomes. The gas system has also faced a squeeze, culminating with the AEMO issuing a ‘Risk/Threat Notice’ for the east-cost gas system last week . Again, there have been several factors at play – with others such as David Close having published more nuanced thoughts on the structural issues in both gas production and storage (i.e. beyond GPG). There are caveats in linking the current situation in each market, as Paul listed here . Storage levels at Iona Underground Gas Facility are still on the decline (seen since mid-May). Source: AEMO How we got here Taking inspiration from Paul’s ‘worm’ charts – in the video below I’ve animated a rolling 3-day cumulative trend of total production, and have also added spatial data to track production by location (also shown on a 3-day rolling cumulative basis). There are two reasons why I’ve chosen to analyse the data in this manner: to highlight the fluctuating nature of yield from the NEM’s wind fleet as it is currently composed, but also; to underscore the challenges in satisfying volume, spatial, and ramping requirements – for gas and/or long-duration storage – in a future grid that will eventually depend on VRE to function. A challenge that is hard to imagine will be solved by the current fleet of ‘big batteries’ , which all have a duration of ~2 hours or less. A view of the 3-day rolling cumulative wind generation trend shows four distinct wind lulls over a span of 2.5 months. Data source: NEMreview The animation attempts to show two different dimensions of data at the same time (i.e. space and time), so I’d recommend that viewers make use of the pause button to better understand both dimensions at each point. There are many moving parts in a system-wide view, but I’ve attempted to annotate four distinct wind shortages over Q2 (where the rolling total dipped below a 15% capacity factor for consecutive days), with approximate dates: Wind Lull #1 (13th April to 20th April): Underperformance of wind farms in VIC, NSW, and parts of SA. Wind Lull #2 (13th May to 18th May): Underperformance of wind farms in SA and VIC. Wind Lull #3 (22nd May to 28th May) : Underperformance of wind farms in VIC, SA, NSW, and parts of TAS. Wind Lull #4 (5th June to 11th June): Underperformance of wind farms in QLD, SA, and TAS. The occurrence of successive wind lulls, reinforces the conclusions published in a WattClairty piece two years ago by Geoff Bongers, Nathan Bongers and Andy Boston – how seasons of low wind and solar will influence what system we need to design for. As a form of reference, the capacity factors for all semi-scheduled wind farms for last year (although on a monthly basis) are shown in the chart below for comparison. This chart was included in our presentation to the Clean Energy Council back in May . For comparison, volume-weighted capacity factors in 2023 were markedly higher in April (25.81%), May (29%) and June (41.2%), compared to what we just saw in Q2 2024. Source: GSD2023 I’ll also note that the first animation only covers production (i.e. output) and not availability (a better reflection of available wind resource). Transmission outages and other network constraints have also been impacting wind production, particularly in NSW, perhaps most notably on May 8th – although that individual occasion did not coincide with the wind lulls mentioned above. Paul has covered other reasons why wind output may have been suppressed in a longer article posted last Saturday . Key Takeaways We’re still at a point in the transition where we should prepare for the ‘dunkel’ and the ‘flaute’ separately. ‘Dunkelflaute’ is a german phrase now synonymous with periods of low solar and wind production – with the literal meaning loosely translating to ‘dark’ (Dunkel) ‘lull’ (Flaute). Whilst there are significant challenges when both happen simultaneously , Q2 has shown us that each separately can be just as consequential. Wind resource diversity has system-wide value. However, as we’ve written about ad nauseam – don’t mistake this for saying that this diversity will solve all of the challenges .",

About Coal… Now let’s move onto coal – with the caveat being I’ve not much time today, so there are threads in what follows that remain unexplored. In the analysis we cover the 10-year span from 2015 to 2024 ytd, so it’s useful to highlight 3 significant events in this period: 1) Most readers will recall that Hazelwood Power Station closed (with only short notice to the market) in April 2017. 2) Likewise, readers will recall that Liddell Power Station closed : (a) One unit in April 2022 (b) The remaining three units through April 2023 3) Also that the 2022 Energy Crisis occurred due to a number of different factors, with one being poor coal fleet availability during the period April-June 2022 . … and indeed that ‘Unavailability of coal units hits 24% across calendar 2022’ (though it has improved somewhat since that time). Production from coal-fired power stations through 2024 Q2 (to 26th June) With those three key events in mind, let’s review production volumes from the coal units collectively through Q2 across the 10 most recent years, including this one: With respect to this chart, some quick observations: 1) We’ve deliberately maintained the same y-axis grid spacing (i.e. steps of 1TWh = 1,000GWh = 1,000,000MWh) as used earlier for Wind in Q2 , Hydro in Q2 , and Gas in Q2 (a) from this we can see the larger scale of the numbers for quarterly production volumes (b) Given that today we see the release of the 2024 ISP , a useful reminder of the large size of the energy transition challenge remaining for the NEM. 2) In terms of production volumes through 2024 Q2 to date, we see (extrapolating forwards by eye) that: (a) That 2024 Q2 is 3TWh-6TWh lower through each of the 2015-2019 years … which were before rooftop PV really started cranking, accelerating the ‘duck curve’ (b) In the 5 most recent years (2020-2024), however, we see: i. Production volumes are significantly higher than the poor performance of 2022 Q2 (perhaps up by 1.5TWh – 2TWh), which is understandable ii. But not as expected was that production volumes in 2023 Q2 are almost identical to 2022 Q2 (and so below 2024 Q2) iii. Production volumes in 2024 Q2 are down on both 2021 Q2 and 2020 Q2 So, using the eye to extrapolate forwards, perhaps ~1TWh lower than 2020 Q2 (and not as large a gap to 2021 Q2) … but without the use of the (now closed) Liddell units. This suggests that, in aggregate, though there have been some coal units experiencing forced outages through Q2, as a fleet has performed reasonably well in 2024 Q2 (compared to the 4 most recent years, and particularly 2023 Q2 and 2022 Q2). Indeed useful to highlight that: 1) When analysing Wind Production through 2024 Q2 we wrote… ‘eyeballing the chart it should be relatively easy to see that 2024 might be as much as 3,000,000MWh ‘short’ of wind production through 2024 Q2 compared to what some might have expected’ 2) When analysing Hydro Production through 2024 Q2 we wrote… ‘that production levels from hydro in 2024 Q2 look such that (if the trends continue) they might end up the second lowest of the 10 years selected.’ … with (eyeballing to extrapolate) production volume in 2024 Q2 perhaps ~1.5TWh lower than in 2022 Q2 (when hydro helped cover for coal’s foibles) 3) In contrast with the results shown for coal (up 1.5TWh to 2TWh on 2022 Q2 and 2023 Q2) we could see that the increased coal production has covered some of the loss in production from Wind and Hydro (all else being equal). Production from coal-fired power stations in June 2024 (to 26th June) If we look (above) at the changing gradient of the line for 2024 Q2 we see some similarities to the two-speed nature of Gas in 2024 Q2 , which prompts me to do the same thing as for gas below, in re-setting the zero axis to be 0MWh at the start of June and just summing from that point: In this case, from the start of the month we see the rate of production in June 2024 is roughly the same as in June 2020, which is the highest of the past 5 years (i.e. 2020 to 2024).",

    "title": "A similar trended view of the aggregate production from Gas-Fired Generation across the NEM through 2024 Q2",
    "date": "25-06-2024 03:37:00 PM",
    "content": "On Saturday 22nd June we posted ‘Where’s the wind gone, through 2024 Q2? … with June perhaps even worse than April or May!’ , which … 1) showed that the aggregate production of wind farms in 2024 Q2 might be worst since 2017 Q2; and also 2) understandably has generated some discussion in various locations. Curiosity has been pulling us further, so we’ve started the process of looking at other portions of the supply side, and the demand side: 1) On Sunday 23rd June we posted ‘A similar trended view of the aggregate production from Hydro Discharge across the NEM through 2024 Q2’ , which: (a) Showed that hydro production levels were also low in 2024 Q2 compared to other comparable periods; (b) But has not garnered anywhere near the same attention 2) Other aspects are coming … but we have a few things on, so might take some time to get through them all. In this article we’ll have a look at gas-fired generation through Q2 till today (Tue 25th June 2024). About Gas… On Wednesday 19th June 2024 the AEMO published ‘East Coast Gas System Risk or Threat Notice’ . … that’s been followed by many articles in Mainstream Media, and also many comments on social media. No time to single out anything particularly interesting, but there has been a lot. With respect to what follows, keep in mind that: 1) The gas supply system is more than just gas-powered generation : (a) There are aspects upstream that are beyond our focus: i. whilst the east coast gas grid is sort of interconnected, the dynamics are different from the real-time nature of the electricity grid, which all spins at 3000rpm together; ii. there are obviously other specific aspects (like the Iona storage talked about in the AEMO Notice) that are impacting at present; iii. which reminds me of the gas system constraints Simshauser and Gilmore wrote about in this working paper . (b) There are also aspects of downstream gas usage that we don’t focus on … I’m particularly thinking about here both: i. How increased gas usage in the southern regions for domestic heating (given the cold start to winter) will have played a role; and also ii. The concerns of our friends in ‘major energy user land’ (such as members of the EUAA) that have concerns about possible interruptions to their supplies. 2) Our focus is on the National Electricity Market ( not the gas grid ) so there are bound to be aspects of the above we’re not aware of (or proficient to observe). 3) Because of the locational factors in the gas grid (and the regional nature of the NEM) there are probably nuances inside of this NEM-wide aggregate not covered here. i. Like Tamar Valley CCGT getting a run ; and ii. Tallawarra B getting a start . 4) I don’t have a lot of time, so there’s lots of threads here that are unexplored . Production from GPG through 2024 Q2 (to 25th June) Following what we did for Wind and Hydro Discharge, here’s the same worm line chart for production levels from gas-fired generation throughout the NEM and spanning the whole of Q2 … with 2024 being to Tuesday 25th June 2024: In this case we’ve selected the last 10 consecutive years … but important to keep in mind (my understanding is) that these really fall into three categories as implied: Period 1 = the early couple years, where LNG exports had begun but not really cranked up to full throughput; … in these years we can see higher production volumes from GPG (particularly in 2017) Period 2 = with LNG exports cranked, and concerns starting to be voiced about decline in Bass Strait (and restrictions on further development of gas fields in VIC and NSW). … production volumes from gas-fired generation decline (readers can read through the article ‘Transition Fooled?’ from 1st February 2021 by Allan O’Neil about this) Period 3 = recent years. … the decline continues, with the standout exception being the much higher use of gas-fired generation during the 2022 Energy Crisis . Particularly for 2024 Q2 year-to-date, it was a very slow start to the quarter (lowest volumes of all 10 years), but we see that’s changed in June 2024 . We saw this when we trended gas fired generation bids over the past 90 days to 22nd June using ez2view Production from GPG just through June 2024 (to 25th June) Resetting the zero axis and zooming in to look particularly at June, we see the different rate of production just for this month: In this case, we see: 1) that the usage pattern of gas-fired generation in June 2024 ytd (i.e. gradient on the line) from 12th June is roughly equal highest in any of the years shown (equal to June 2022) 2) what particularly stands out is how much lower the gradient is for June 2023 , for reasons not explored at this stage. Apologies that it’s brief, but that’s all we have time for today…",

    "title": "A similar trended view of the aggregate production from Hydro Discharge across the NEM through 2024 Q2",
    "date": "23-06-2024 08:54:00 PM",
    "content": "Over the weekend we posted this extended comparison of Aggregate Wind Production through (almost all of) 2024 Q2 , compared to the four most recent years. … that showed that the aggregate production of wind farms in 2024 Q2 might be worst since 2017 Q2. Curiosity has pulled us further, so we’ve completed a similar comparison here of hydro production levels through (almost all of) 2024 Q2 , compared to both: 1) The four preceding years; but also 2) Five other years that were specifically selected for particular reason: (a) We selected 2012 Q2, 2013 Q2 and 2014 Q2: i. given that they straddled the 2-year ‘Carbon Tax’ period of FY 2012-13 and FY 2013-14, ii. and so produced different commercial incentives in each year; (b) We also selected 2007 Q2 and 2008 Q2, which were both affected by the ‘Millennium Drought’ to different extents. Comparing hydro production levels in 2024 Q2 against 9 other years With now 10 x ‘worm lines’ shown on this chart (including 2024 Q2 not quite complete) we see the following, as a result: (with image now corrected for typo on the dates – thanks for the pickup!) Firstly, with respect to the years not selected , readers should note that: 1) Prior to 2020 we used some judgement (and were led by curiosity) in selecting years for which to crunch numbers … but freely admit that we might have missed seeing other nuances in years not selected; 2) So please keep this in mind in understanding that the above is an incomplete picture. With respect to the 10 years selected there’s a few things that jump out to this reader, including the following: 1) Of the two years we’ve selected as ‘affected by the Millennium Drought’ we see: (a) that 2008 Q2 saw significantly lower production volumes than any of the other 9 years shown; (b) whilst 2007 Q2 production levels were closely matched with 2012 Q2 and 2024 Q2 production levels at the bottom half of the scale. 2) Of the three years selected with respect to the ‘Carbon Tax’ era, we see: (a) 2012 Q2 production volumes lower than 2013 and 2014 Q2; (b) this is what we expected to see – because of the commercial incentive, given the instant revenue uplift available from 1st July 2012 when the carbon tax came into existence (if it was possible to bank hydro generation and defer its operations for a revenue boost in July). (c) at the other end of the 2-year period, there was the opposite incentive to run hydro hard in 2014 Q2, because of the step-change loss in value once 2014 Q3 was underway. … however it’s not apparent directly in the charts above (though Tasmanians will remember how running hydro generation hard in 2014 Q2 preceded an unfortunate quinella of lower-than-expected rainfalls and a lengthy basslink outage to result in a very tight supply-demand balance and a need to install emergency diesel generators and curtail major energy users). 3) In the most recent 5-year period, we see that: (a) The production in 2020 Q2 was (barely!) the second lowest of the bunch of 5 years, ever-so-slightly lower than 2023 Q2 (b) Production in 2021 Q2 was ~200,000MWh higher than either of those two years (c) Production levels in 2022 Q2 was the highest of all 10 years (almost 2TWh higher than the lowest of the 10 … drought-affected 2008 Q2) i. This was the period of the 2022 Energy Crisis ii. I’d forgotten about this response – but it seems clear in these numbers that hydro had ramped up to cover the loss of other supply sources (d) We can see that production levels from hydro in 2024 Q2 look such that (if the trends continue) they might end up the second lowest of the 10 years selected. Some factors in the lower hydro production levels As with almost all outcomes in the NEM there are likely more than one contributing factors … without delving in any detail, I wonder about: 1) In articles such as this one about Tamar Valley CCGT we noted low levels of hydro storage in Tasmania (this Q2 period has reported as much drier than expected for southern parts of the NEM … though notably not NSW!) … I’d also seen Vedran Kovac at Hydro Tasmania quoted in RenewEconomy as stating that low hydro levels were more significant than low wind in prompting Tamar Valley CCGT to be given a run. 2) It’s at the other end of the NEM (and smaller), but worth noting that Barron Gorge hydro has been offline since it was damaged in December 2023 by TC Jasper. 3) I’ve not had time to look, but wonder to what extend the rainfall in NSW might have affected operations of the Snowy Hydro facility? 4) I’ve also not had time to look, but also wonder if the price performance through 2024 Q2 (i.e. higher prices in the middle of the day, at least at some times) led to less opportunity for time-shifting in the pumped hydro plant (Wivenhoe, Shoalhaven and Tumut) … hence less generation during ‘peak’ periods from those facilities? Obviously more for someone to delve further into, as time permits….",

    "title": "Where’s the wind gone, through 2024 Q2?   … with June perhaps even worse than April or May!",
    "date": "22-06-2024 07:46:00 PM",
    "content": "Firstly, it’s useful to reference three prior articles about low wind conditions , which we surely have been experiencing: 1) On 1st June 2024 we published ‘More detail on the poor wind yield through (most of!) April and May 2024’ containing 5 ‘worm line’ trends for cumulative production from wind farms across the NEM through April and May of 5 most recent years. 2) That followed from the earlier article in the same day noting the seeming oxymoron: ‘Highest-ever wind yield … *and* worst wind yield since June 2017!’ 3) Finally, with reference to question in the title of this article, this harks back to the article published on 30th June 2017 ‘ Where’s the wind gone? NEM-wide wind farm operation lowest in 5 years (maybe ever, on like-for-like basis?)’ … referencing a prolonged period of low wind through June 2017 ( seven years ago ). A view through (almost) the whole of 2024 Q2, compared to the 4 most recent years Given what might turn out to be the early stages of a an emerging 2024 Energy Crisis , we’ve been interested to learn more about how Q2 has been evolving. Hence (starting with wind) we have taken the ‘worm line’ trend from the first article noted above, and have extended each of the 5 trends through until the end of June of that year (or for the current year to earlier today, 22nd June 2024). Now note that the AEMO forecasts from this afternoon were suggesting a moderate burst of wind that would last ~24 hours from around midday on Tuesday 25th June 2024 … which will mean: 1) What eventuates may not be quite so dramatic as what’s drawn in the dotted red line; 2) But it should be plain to see for all readers here that the aggregate yield from Wind Farms across the NEM in 2024 is easily the worst of the 5 years sampled : (a) Even in absolute terms, it will be miles below the aggregate yield in 2023 Q2 and 2022 Q2 (i.e. that same quarter of the 2022 Energy Crisis !) . i. In both 2022 and 2023 we see that the gradient of the worm line increased in June of those years (i.e. wind yield increased) ii. In 2024 this definitely has not happened (save for 2 x 3-day spurts thus far) … and indeed I wonder if the gradient has not slightly dropped, compared to April and May? (b) Given the growth in capacity from the earlier two years, it should be clear the performance is much poorer in 2024 Q2 compared to those earlier years: i. Approximately 2,500MW more capacity in 2024 than 2021 (3 years earlier) and a yield that might be about the same level! ii. Almost 4,000MW more capacity in 2024 than in 2020 (i.e. ~50% more) and yet a yield that might only be 15% higher than 2020 Q2. 3) In aggregate terms, eyeballing the chart it should be relatively easy to see that 2024 might be as much as 3,000,000MWh ‘short’ of wind production through 2024 Q2 compared to what some might have expected All in all, what’s above is (at the same time) both a frightening picture … but also completely expected (at least by some of us). Remember, this is Output (which can be suppressed for several reasons) ! Remember that these trends above are of output of wind farms collectively. In reviewing these results, readers should be aware that this output could have been affected by any (or all) of the following factors: Factor #1 – lulls in the wind resource There’s definitely been some of this at work in 2024 (e.g. persistent blocking high pressure systems) … but is it the only factor? Factor #2 – plant unavailability It’s possible that some wind farms might be experiencing poor plant availability, which would impact … but how would we actually know that? (a) Since 7th August 2023 the Semi-Scheduled operators have been able to use MaxAvail in the bid to quickly reflect situations such as plant unavailability. Through the remainder of 2023 we saw that many DUIDs did utilise this capability . i. At this point we have not checked to see how much of this was active through 2024 Q2 ii. But we’re also conscious that, even if we did, the same visibility is not there for prior Q2 periods (so comparing to some historical precedent would not be possible). (b) However there’s still not complete clarity about physical issues onsite at the Semi-Scheduled units, as the AEMC neglected to extend the responsibilities stemming from ‘ the ERM Rule Change ‘ to Semi-Scheduled units (as we’ve written concerns about several times before, such as here ). Factor #3 – spillage It’s possible that some wind farms might also been spilling available energy through one or more of the Q2 periods … if so, that would not be visible in the above. There are numerous articles written here about curtailment of VRE, with some particularly useful ones collated under the ‘Curtailment of VRE’ category . Remember that ‘spillage’ or ‘curtailment’ might due to several reasons, including two big ones: Factor 3a = spillage for Economic Reasons In simple terms, ‘Economic Curtailment’ occurs when the unit does not like the spot price (e.g. it’s below their ‘negative LGC’ break even price) and so they switch off i. since the AER Rule Change , this was clarified that it needs to happen only through their bids. ii. However (particularly in recent weeks) my sense has been more middle-of-the-day prices at very healthy levels, so I would not expect that there would have been much Economic Curtailment in recent weeks. We’ll see a more methodical review of 2024 Q4 prices when we publish the next edition in this ‘Review of Q2 Price Outcomes’ series of articles . Factor 3b = spillage due to Network Constraints … in other words, they are being ‘constrained down’ because of localised situations in the network (or sometimes broader reasons, like System Strength constraints). Seven years since the ‘Wind Drought’ in 2007 Note the significance is of the 7 year time-span since the ‘wind drought’ of 2017 Q2 ! It reminds me of the analysis we compiled in Appendix 27 of GenInsights21 a few years ago now … in which we identified (based on 16 years of weather data history at the time) that significant & sustained bad wind periods : 1) Occurred three times in that same period … hence averaging to once every 5 years; and also 2) Actually occurring, on the calendar, roughly 5 years apart. Earlier this year we thought it would be useful to share this ‘precis of the ‘Exploring Wind Diversity’ analysis completed in Appendix 27 of GenInsights21’ . It will be with keen interest that we (when time permits, in July) publish an update on these long-term wind production statistics to include the full-month capacity factor for June 2024. We need decades of weather history, not just a year or two, for robust modelling (and credible conclusions)! In Appendix 27 of GenInsights21 we utilised 16 years of weather history, because that was all we had … but we were clear in the report at noting that it would be better to have used 50 or 60 years. The 5 years presented above are a very visible (and topical) reminder that some years can be much more challenging than others. Makes me shake my head when seeing others model a year or two of weather history and then offering the results of the (very, very limited) modelling to purportedly ‘prove’ some hypothesis about the amount of firming capacity required!",

    "date": "20-06-2024 03:58:00 PM",
    "content": "Those following our WattClarity coverage this week would be aware that the NEM has experienced supply-demand tightness for the past three nights, with this trend set to continue into this evening. As we’ve been tracking , NEM-wide IRPM ( Instantaneous Reserve Plant Margin ) has dropped below 15% during the evening peaks on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday this week – which in short, means that there has been less than 15% available generation in excess of what has been dispatched to meet demand. Thus far, IRPM has hit a low of 10.89% which occured during the 18:25 dispatch interval on Tuesday evening. Apart from a couple of isolated price spikes in South Australia, this supply-demand tightness has thus far not eventuated into extreme pricing. As we’ve noted, the main drivers for this tightness have been cold temperatures (increasing demand via heating), low evening wind speeds, and a number of offline coal units. Below I’ll focus on the wind aspect, and share a couple of visuals that should help us understand the spread and extent of the wind lull over the three previous evenings. — We’ll start with a quick look at the pressure systems that have formed over eastern half of Australia. The screenshot below taken from Windy this afternoon shows a high-pressure system centered above an area east of Brisbane, and a low-pressure system formed above the southern coast of South Australia. Pressure isolines and wind speeds as at 2pm this afternoon. Shows that a low-pressure system has formed over South Australia, but higher wind speeds are largely confined to the North and West of the Spencer Gulf. Source: Windy. Elevation at 850hPa This current weather system has brought higher wind speeds north and west of the Spencer Gulf as we can see in the image above, but unfortunately, we have not seen especially high evening winds in the areas that contain the largest concentrations of wind farms in the eastern part of the state, and in western Victoria. The image below shows the spread of availability across the NEM’s semi-scheduled wind fleet. A snapshot of available wind generation as at 6pm, for each of the past three evenings. Click here for a high-resolution version of this image. Data source: NEMreview Going through each of the regions, I note the following: Very low wind for the three semi-scheduled wind farms in Tasmania, across all three evenings. Relatively low wind in Victoria, and especially so on Tuesday evening (June 18th). Relatively low wind available for the large cluster of wind farms in South Australia, although this picked up on Wednesday evening (June 19th). Relatively low wind in New South Wales across the three evenings. High wind for the two wind farms in southern Queensland on Monday evening (June 17th), but relatively poor yield in the region otherwise.

    "title": "Kogan Creek comes offline, on Thursday 20th June 2024",
    "date": "20-06-2024 03:51:00 PM",
    "content": "One other thing that happened this morning, was the Kogan Creek came offline, as captured at that time in this ‘Notification’ widget alert in ez2view : This shows that the unit was offline just prior to the 07:35 SCADA snapshot taken for InitialMW for the 07:40 dispatch interval. Let’s walk through several widgets in ez2view to see what we can see in this respect… (A) Has the outage been reflected in MT PASA DUID Availability at this time? When we wrote about the Tarong North outage on Friday 14th June , we illustrated (with the ‘Generator Outages’ widget ) that the generator had adjusted the availability for a few days forward from that point, reflecting the fact that they knew relatively quickly that it would take a few days to fix. In this snapshot from the same widget at 14:45 today, we see that the same has not applied for Kogan Creek: Noting that there’s been an update of this forward-looking data set from AEMO for 09:00 and again for 12:00 this morning, we’re inferring that the generator in this case is still hoping that Kogan Creek will be back before Sunday 23rd June (i.e. which is the start of the MT PASA DUID Availability time horizon at this point). (B) Was there anything in yesterday’s bids? Noting that the unit came offline after the 04:00 end of the prior Market Day (i.e. so bids for 07:35 are not visible until tomorrow’s ‘next day public’ release), we still wonder if there is anything visible in the bids for the prior day. Hence we look at ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view as follows: Interestingly we see that: 1) The last 4 bids shown in the Bid Table all reference ‘Unit Commitment’ … which might refer to some form of significant technical challenge with the plant; and 2) In particular the rebid shown as received by the AEMO at 01:26 this morning, and used in the 01:35 dispatch interval, references ‘unit offline revised’ . This, to me, suggests that the generator was aware of some need whereby the unit might need to come offline … 6 hours (or more) prior to the unit actually coming offline. With the ‘Bid Comparison’ function in this widget we can (control-click) select the last two rows and use the magnifying glass highlighted to compare the two to see the following: What we see here, in comparing the two most recent bids we have access to, does illustrate that CS Energy was planning that the unit would be offline in the early hours of the morning … but for reasons unknown to us (Rebid Reason suggests to ‘See Log’ for details, for those who have access – not us!) they decided that either : Scenario 1) The unit did not need to come off so early, or Scenario 2) The unit did not need to come off at all … there’s insufficient data in the above for us to ascertain which. Looking further up in the ‘Bid Table’ in the image above, we see that there’s a rebid received by AEMO at 12:15 on Tuesday 18th June 2024 that actually saw the first notice of the need to take the unit offline . Here’s that detailed view: (C) What’s visible in ST PASA? The ST PASA data set is currently an opaque data set, because Available Generation is only published on a region-level aggregate basis. So one needs to squint (quite a bit) to see if anything is visible around the time of the change in bid above. Using the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget , we see the following: Remember that this widget allows the user to ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to ‘see that other dimension of time ’ As highlighted on the image, there was a change in aggregate Available Generation expectation around the time of the rebid from CS Energy … but understanding the meaning of this particular data does take some squinting. (D) MT PASA DUID Availability in ‘Forecast Convergence’ Not shown here, but a look at MT PASA DUID Availability in the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget , does show a recent anticipation of a period of reduced availability (i.e. down to 500MW) out till 1st July 2024 – again suggesting some known issue the generator is trying to navigate around. That’s all I have time for, now…",

In terms of low points, one particular one stood out to me – which is this one here: This time-travelled snapshot in ez2view focuses on the 13:20 dispatch interval on Thursday 13th June 2024 (i.e. almost exactly a week ago) when we saw: 1) Aggregate output from Wind Farms across the NEM being a miserly 88MW ; 2) Which works out to be an instantaneous capacity factor of 0.77% A few additional notes: 1) From a VRE perspective, remember that this is early afternoon so we would hope (I have not checked) that solar yield was cranking at that time; 2) In the ‘NEM Map’ on the left, we can see that: (a) most of that 88MW was coming from Wind Farms in South Australia (i.e. 65MW, still a very low level for all the capacity there) (b) whereas TAS, VIC, NSW and QLD were all very becalmed. 3) Now that we have a zoomed in view: (a) we can see that there was no curtailment of wind (for economic curtailment or network curtailment reasons) (b) meaning that it’s just because the wind was very, very becalmed. 4) For the pedantic reader who tries to add the numbers up from the ‘NEM Map’ on the left, remember the ‘law of small numbers’ means that rounding of decimals means you will get slightly different to 88MW.

    "title": "Correlation between low wind Capacity Factor and low IRPM (NEM-wide) in recent evenings + Thursday evening looks likely to be low, as well.",
    "date": "20-06-2024 10:46:00 AM",
    "content": "In recent evenings this week (specifically Monday 17th June , Tuesday 18th June and Wednesday 19th June ) we’ve posted articles looking at instances where the NEM-wide IRPM has dropped to quite low levels after sunset , along with other factors including: 1) Some coal units offline; and 2) Aggregate wind harvest low. This has all (combined with other factors) placed stress on the gas supply system/market … both for domestic heating in the southern regions, and for gas powered generation. So I thought I’d take a quick look at the correlation between low IRPM and low Aggregate Wind Generation, using the ‘Trends Engine’ inside of ez2view . Here’s a trend I put together this morning looking back 28 days, and forward ~1 day into P30 predispatch: Frequent readers will remember that: 1) They can click on the image to open as larger resolution in another tab, to read in conjunction with the following; and 2) Those with a licence to ez2view can open their own copy of this trend query here . I’ve deliberately gone back that far so that the trend highlights the two big bursts of strong wind output: 1) Spanning ~3 days at the end of May and including the new all-time record on the evening of 30th May (a) at which point we see instantaneous Capacity Factor for Wind across the NEM almost reached 75% … a very impressive level (b) which is even more impressive when seeing some clearly visible levels of spillage (curtailment for network and/or pricing reasons) over the same period 2) Spanning ~3 days from late on 10th June That helps to provide some context to why I’m correct in saying that aggregate instantaneous wind capacity factors over the recent evenings have been quite disappointing … and also somewhat concerning, thinking into the future. Day Statistics Monday 17th June 2024 On Monday evening 17th June we saw a ‘90-minute run of IRPM < 15% on Monday evening 17th June 2024’ with the lowest point being down at 11.76% . At the same (i.e. 17:55) dispatch interval we saw ‘ Market Demand ’ peak at 31,948MW. During the period of low IRPM we saw Wind Capacity Factor slowly ramp up, to reach a ‘height’ of only 16% . Tuesday 18th June 2024 On Tuesday evening 18th june we saw well over 120 minutes of IRPM < 15%, with the lowest point being down at 10.89% . That same (i.e. 18:25) dispatch interval saw ‘ Market Demand ’ peak at 31,842MW. During the period of low IRPM we saw Wind Capacity Factor barely rise above 10% . Wednesday 19th June 2024 Yesterday evening 19th June we saw a ‘shorter and shallower bout of low IRPM …’ , with the lowest point being ‘only’ 13.85% . On the flip side, the same evening saw ‘ Market Demand ’ up at 32,262MW … so higher than seen on either on Monday 17th June or Tuesday 18th June . During the evening period yesterday we saw Wind Capacity Factor rise above 25% … which is one of the reasons IRPM was not as low as the prior 2 days (especially with demand being higher). Thursday 20th June 2024 It’s only a forecast at this point, but the current forecasts suggest that IRPM might even drop to under 10% this evening … which is a very, very rare occurrence in the history of the NEM ! Currently AEMO forecasts have wind capacity factor forecast to be just under 10% this evening as well, coincident with the low IRPM (and peak demand). Let’s wait to see what actually unfolds … Clearly there are some challenges to grapple with, in a ‘VRE + Firming’ path being taken for this Energy Transition. That’s why it’s crucially important to pay close attention (as we do, in each GenInsights Quarterly Updates ) to Aggregate Scheduled Target , as an indicator of the ongoing requirement for firming capacity . The numbers right now seem to indicate another period this evening where >30,000MW of firming capacity was required . PS1 events earlier in May/June, highlighted in the chart Also worth flagging the other periods highlighted on the chart. Day Statistics Thursday 30th May 2024 We noted the new all-time record on the evening of 30th May Tuesday 4th June 2024 We’ve highlighted the evening of Tuesday 4th June 2024 because the IRPM dropped below 20% on that evening. There are several articles written with respect to this day collated here on WattClarity . Thursday 13th June at 13:20 We’ve noted in the chart that the aggregate output from all the wind farms in the NEM was a very meagre 88MW at the 13;20 dispatch interval. This has now been addressed specifically in ‘A brief review of the (only!) 88MW of wind output NEM-wide at 13:20 on Thursday 13th June 2024’ . Thursday 13th June We’ve highlighted the evening of Thursday 13th June 2024 because the IRPM dropped below 20% on that evening.

    "content": "On Wednesday 19th June 2024 (coinciding with a period of high gas usage for gas-power generation during Monday 17th June , Tuesday 18th June and Wednesday 19th June – especially for evening periods where IRPM dropped to quite low levels after sunset and with aggregate wind yields being at the lower end of the spectrum – the AEMO has published this ‘East Coast Gas System Risk or Threat Notice’ : The whole notice is worth reading (it’s only a page!) but it’s worth highlighting a couple things: (A) It’s for a long duration … the remainder of Q2 and whole of Q3! The notice says: ‘the likely duration of the identified risk or threat is from 19 June 2024 and is expected, on the basis of current information, to continue until no later than 30 September or as otherwise advised by AEMO’ … or, in other words, there’s not an easy fix to the challenge. Something that will play out in the back-drop when as we walk through 2024 Q3 . (B) Why are we here? Some contributing factors are noted here: ‘the identified potential risk or threat event summary is • Recent gas supply and demand trends for the southern jurisdictions (NSW, ACT, VIC, SA & TAS.) indicate there is the potential for gas supply shortfalls due to the depletion of southern storage inventories , particularly Iona UGS . • High Gas Powered Generation demand combined with lower than forecasted Longford Gas Plant production due to an unplanned outage extension has resulted in a high rate of Iona UGS inventory depletion. • The Facility Operator of the Longford Gas Plant (FacilityID: 530040) has reported that offshore maintenance will continue to constrain production capacity to a lower than forecast level through to at least 1 July 2024. Refer to AEMO Gas Bulletin Board, Medium Term Capacity Outlook for detail https://aemo.com.au/energysystems/gas/gas-bulletin-board-gbb/data-gbb/gas-flows ; • Constrained Longford production capacity in combination with high winter seasonal demand and the potential for continued high gas generation demand will continue result in continued high withdrawals from the Storage facilities located in the southern jurisdictions (Iona UGS, Newcastle LNG and Dandenong LNG) and reduce the storage inventory in these facilities. • Further storage inventory depletion may occur if an unplanned event occurs that impacts either gas demand (e.g., Gas Powered Generation) or supply (production, storage or pipeline constraint). • Low or depleted storage inventory will result in reduced gas supply capacity in the southern jurisdictions. • Reduced storage facility delivery capacity may pose a risk to gas supply adequacy in southern jurisdictions on peak demand days during the winter peak demand period (through to 30 September 2024).’ Winter’s really only just started!",

    "content": "Prompted by sequence of alerts about of lack of reserve market notices I delved in to the data to understand where and when using the LOR outlook for the NEM’s regions in ez2view . The alerts were configured on market notices containing LOR , which were fed through to our messaging channel rather than the more commonly used SMS option: The forecast convergence widget captures (at 15:40 on the 18th June) the state of LOR conditions. NSW is the region impacted. LOR level 1 and 2 conditions are projected for multiple periods spanning the evenings and some mornings of the 18 th , 19 th , 20 th and 21 st of June in NSW. We can clearly see couple of rough periods of LOR2 conditions projected for the coming days. AEMO is calling for a market response so they should hopefully not eventuate (and may even be alleviating as we read). Nonetheless it is indicative of a tight energy supply outlook at present. The outlook for LOR conditions in NSW is looking rough. Although taken earlier in the day (about midday, remains indicative for the afternoon at the time of writing), this screen-capture from Windy.com demonstrates how offshore wind could be useful in alleviating such low reserve conditions when onshore wind energy production is sub optimal. The visualisation (source: Windy ) shows orange patches of winds reaching upwards of 45 km/h, offshore from Wollongong. Inland regions appear to be experiencing speeds half that, at best. Take Crookwell where winds were assigned to the light-blue zone, about 15 km/h. Yet our internal team messaging channel also noted, via ABC NEWS , there is opposition from the Opposition on offshore wind zones in New South Wales! There’s something to consider.",

    "date": "18-06-2024 12:15:00 PM",
    "content": "Some readers might be wondering why the current forecast is that the NEM-wide IRPM might be lower this evening than it was yesterday evening ( as noted earlier this morning ). One contributing factor will be that Mt Piper Unit 1 has come offline overnight, as captured here in this email alert from the ‘Notifications’ widget in ez2view : As seen above, the unit was offline by 01:20 on Tuesday 18th June 2024. Because this is before the 04:00 ‘end of Market Day’ timing, I expected to see some reason for the outage noted in the ‘next day public’ bid bands – which we can review with ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget inside of ez2view as shown here: Highlighted at the bottom (i.e. last bid or rebid we can see at this point) was the rebid received by AEMO at 21:12 referencing ‘boiler tube leak’ in the rebid reason. Not shown here, but the ‘Bid Comparison’ function confirms that this was the rebid in which the generator made their intention known to take the unit offline overnight. Now that ~12l hours have elapsed on Tuesday 18th June 2024 , we can expect that more information from the generator about the expected date for return to service might now be visible in the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view as shown here: Because of the idiosyncrasies of the forward-looking MT PASA DUID Availability data set: 1) Data for the next four days (i.e. Wed 19th , Thu 20th , Fri 21st and Sat 22nd June ) won’t have been updated to reflect the recent unit change-of-state; 2) However data from Sun 23rd June forwards has been today, and as such: (a) We see the unit availability set at 0MW for Sun 23rd June ; and (b) We see the unit availability set at 720MW for Mon 24th June 2024 . … which indicates the current expectation of the generator is that the unit will be back online sometime Monday 24th June 2024.",

At that dispatch interval, we also saw the ‘ Market Demand ’ climb well past the 30,000MW mark and almost reach 32,000MW. Curiosity got the better of me, so I opened up the ‘Trends Engine’ within my copy of ez2view and produced this 21-day trend of IRPM, looking back 14 days and forward 7 days into P30 predispatch and ST PASA: Those with a licence to the software can open their own copy of this trend here . I’ve highlighted two things on the chart: 1) At the bottom we see that the forecast levels of Instantaneous Reserve Plant Margin are such that the levels look set* to drop below 15% for each of the next three days : * i.e. based on current forecasts, but remember that AEMO’s forecasts are intended to encourage a market response, if possible.

(b) Wednesday 19th June, with forecasts levels higher, but still below 15%; (c) Thursday 20th June, with forecasts levels higher, but still below 15%. 2) At the top of the chart we see that the forecast level of ‘ Market Demand ’ is such that the levels look set to rise beyond 30,000MW for each of the next three days: (a) Tuesday 18th June with forecast levels currently lower than yesterday: (b) Wednesday 19th June, with forecasts levels higher than yesterday (up above 32,000MW) ; (c) Thursday 20th June, with forecasts levels about the same as yesterday.

    "content": "With respect to this morning, we noticed that Ben Domensino had written ‘Six Aussie states below zero degrees this morning, more to come’ earlier today. — It was quite a brisk 90-minute walk home from the office this evening, given the widespread ‘lingering cold air mass’ that Ben spoke about in his article. Throughout the walk, my phone was buzzing with a spell of SMS alerts notifying me that the NEM-wide IRPM had dropped below 15% … which is something that rarely happens, and is a sign of a relatively tight supply-demand balance. Whilst I was walking, Dan Lee was able to post ‘Cold temperatures and low wind push NEM-wide IRPM down to 11.76% on Monday 17th June 2024’ capturing the lowest point for NEM-wide Instantaneous Reserve Plant Margin this evening. After arriving home (and keeping in mind we’ll end up reviewing this in more detail as part of the broader review of 2024 Q2 , when we get to that), I took this snapshot from NEMwatch at 18:50 on which we’ve highlighted a number of things: Specifically: 1) At this point we see three interesting things: (a) that the NEM-wide IRPM is at 14.41% (rounded down in the display above); (b) that the NEM-wide ‘ Market Demand ’ is 31,301MW; and also (c) That none of the interconnectors are constrained … meaning: i. no ‘ Economic Island s’ formed; and hence ii. Regional prices tightly tied together (separated just by dynamic inter-regional loss factors). 2) We see that the cold weather has enlivened ‘ Market Demand ’ in each region, driving it up out of the ‘green zone’ in each case (particularly in TAS); 3) We see that the NEM-wide ‘ Market Demand ’ appears to have come close to 32,000MW ; 4) We see that the supply mix supplying this evening peak is relatively low on VRE : (a) Obviously no solar at this point; and also (b) Aggregate wind yield is ~1,700MW at this dispatch interval (compare this to the historical range recorded here for recent months to see that it’s below average). 5) We also see several Market Notices in which the AEMO is speaking about forecast LOR1 level tight supply-demand balance in the days ahead in various regions. … noting again that AEMO issues these notices to encourage a market response. — Because we’ll be coming back to this later (for GenInsights Quarterly Updates for 2024 Q2 ) I’ve grabbed the tabular record of NEM-wide IRPM from NEMwatch and highlighted the 90-minute stretch (17:30 to 18:55): In this table we can see that the 17:55 dispatch interval (for which Dan noted the IRPM down at 11.76% ) also saw the highest NEM-wide ‘ Market Demand ’ this evening … at 31,947MW . When we are working through the broader review of 2024 Q2 , I’ll also be interested in what this means for Aggregate Scheduled Target , as an indicator of the ongoing requirement for firming capacity . The numbers right now seem to indicate another period where >30,000MW of firming capacity was required .",

    "title": "When will we start seeing BDUs in dispatch?",
    "date": "15-06-2024 04:35:00 PM",
    "content": "This article is posted primarily to augment some direct communications with a significant number of our clients. By posting here, we expect it will also be of interest to some others in our broader readership. — On Monday 3rd June we wrote about how ‘(The main part of) IESS goes live today – Monday 3rd June 2024’ . With the changes made on that day as part of the broader IESS process process, it facilitated the possible emergence of both: 1) bi-directional units (i.e. BDUs), and 2) proper hybrids (as distinct from co-located units, as Ellise refers to them ), … but we’ve not yet seen any emerge in the ~2 weeks since. We’ve not even (yet) seen the migration of the old-style scheduled battery units (i.e. with a DUID-G1 supply-side unit and a DUID-L1 demand-side unit) … (Our understanding of) the Migration path for existing batteries … but that’s not a surprise! On 8 th May 2024, the AEMO advised us: ‘While registrations for new BDUs can technically begin from the IESS Rule effective date, i.e., 3 June 2024, the first BDU registration is not expected until the end of June 2024 at the earliest . This means that while the changes to the production environment to cater for registrations will be in the system, the first BDU will not be seen in the environment until the end of June. Existing BESS that must cutover from the current two-DUID model to the single BDU DUID model will begin from mid-July (26 batteries transitioning through March 2025), from which time they will also start to appear in production’ In an information session in the week just passed for Market Participants and other Stakeholders, the AEMO presented this diagram illustrating the intended cut-over process (and our recollection is that they mentioned Wednesday 3rd July as the earliest possible cut-over date now): Notwithstanding that this is ‘subject to change by AEMO, potentially without notice’ (and also that we might have misinterpreted something in here), I thought it would be worth sharing with our readers here to assist in the general level of awareness of what’s going on. What we’re expecting to see … Unless I have mis-counted, there are currently 26 batteries registered as scheduled units in the AEMO dispatch systems. 1) We don’t know the exact dates on which each of these will transition …though our understanding is that this is quite likely to be staggered over many weeks from sometime in July. 2) However we do envisage that the final form of each of the batteries will be DUIDs of the following form: Our understanding is that any new battery not on the list above must be registered from day 1 as a BDU.",

    "date": "14-06-2024 03:56:00 PM",
    "content": "Last week I published Part 1 of ‘ who’s who in the ESOO ’ where I looked to identify the projects that were delayed or removed in the updated modelling for the latest ESOO . Here I will close the thread by listing the projects that progressed between the two versions, which should provide further insights into the state of the NEM’s development pipeline. Newly progressed capacity On Page 11 of the May update of the ESOO , the document states “Approximately 4.6 GW of new generation and storage capacity has advanced sufficiently to be considered in this ESOO update since the 2023 ESOO, published in August 2023”. The next page goes on to state that this figure comprised of “over 3 GW” of battery projects and “over 1 GW” of solar and wind projects, but with no mention of specifics. With some difficulty, I believe I’ve managed to track down 3.9 GW of projects from this figure using the generation information record kept by AEMO. As I alluded to in Part 1, this data source is not always reliable or easy to analyse – so please leave a comment if you know of any of the projects that make up the missing 0.7 GW, or if you spot any mistakes.

From looking at the table above, two key points immediately stand out to me: Half of these projects are expecting completion by the end of next calendar year; however, Only one of these twenty projects is marked with the ‘Committed’ status. As I mentioned in Part 1, projects marked as ‘Anticipated’ were excluded from the central scenario of the reliability forecast in prior years. These two points might raise concerns in either 1) the confidence of those expected completion dates, or 2) the loose categorisations of project statuses. Shortcomings in project status reporting I’ve compiled the table above from scraping historical versions of the generation information dataset. For context, the dataset is managed by the AEMO and populated through the Generator Survey process (which is specifically conducted for ESOO modelling purposes). It is NER Clause 3.13.3A that provides the market operator with the power to request this information from registered participants (including project developers). Beyond its original purpose, industry stakeholders often use the same dataset as the basis for their forward-looking projections when making decisions on investment, policy, financial positions, etc. To the best of my knowledge, this is the only official (and most reliable) public record of development projects in the NEM and their current status. However, those familiar would be aware of its many shortcomings. The information is largely self-reported, and survey responses are not always returned on a consistent frequency, and some entries appear either unreliable or outdated. For example, the La Trobe Valley BESS is currently marked as ‘Anticipated’ and has an expected completion date of July 2024 (i.e. next month) in the most recent generation information spreadsheet published on May 27th 2024 . However, in the project’s recent June 2024 newsletter , an update was provided stating that early construction work began in December last year, and appears to show that little-to-no electrical work has commenced. What development timeframe can we expect for new projects? This is an important but difficult question to answer, as project scale and the speed of supply chains can vary significantly. In March, I published a deep dive into the development timelines for each of the twenty batteries registered in the NEM . In the chart below, I’ve updated the data for the four BESS projects still in development, and have ordered the projects by completion month. Delivery times for BESS projects registered in the NEM. The long-term trend appears to show an ongoing slowdown. Note: A full list of references for dates of financial close and start of full operation can be found in the original article . Judging by the post-covid trend in these delivery times, it’s not unreasonable to think that we are trending towards an 18-to-30 month expected delivery period for a BESS project to reach completion from financial close. We should also keep in mind that projects are expected to continue to increase significantly in size (and complexity), particularly for BESS and wind projects. Key Takeaways Continuing on from the conclusions in Part 1 , I have two final points from conducting this analysis: Despite the AEMO’s best efforts, the NEM lacks a sufficiently robust, up-to-date, and vetted database of new projects in development. This leads me to my second key takeaway below. A model can only be as good as its inputs. We should keep this front of mind when we consider and digest the big decisions that shape the energy transition.",

    "date": "14-06-2024 03:54:00 PM",
    "content": "A short article before our 4pm deadline today (for the newsletter to subscribers) to record the bout of volatility seen in Tasmania on Friday afternoon 14th June 2024. We see this firstly (for prices >$1,000/MWh, which was the alert threshold) in this run of volatility captured via ‘SMS Alarms’ in ez2view today: We see the volatility this afternoon, appended to the brief run of volatility Thursday 13th June 2024 as well. In the image above we’ve highlighted the 14:05 dispatch interval, which is shown in more detail in this image captured from NEMwatch at the time: With respect to the numbering: 1) The spot price in TAS is $7,175.28/MWh, which is slightly lower than the high point reached in the next dispatch interval; 2) This is the 4th dispatch interval above $1,000/MWh … but we also see it’s been above $100/MWh for most of the past 12 hours. 3) We see Basslink is cranked above the maximum running southwards (a) -438MW flow south, which is more negative than the –402MW ‘import limit’ (b) meaning Over-Constrained Dispatch (from 13:50 to 14:10 inclusive). 4) There’s plenty of spare capacity in TAS available (i.e. an IRPM of the TAS ‘ Economic Island ’ so formed above 100%) … so it’s not ‘simply’ tight supply-demand balance that’s causing the volatility 5) We see it’s still cold in Hobart around the middle of the day … but the ‘ Market Demand ’ is in the green zone. 6) Yesterday we’d written that ‘Gas-fired generation running more strongly in TAS (and Tamar Valley CCGT for the first time) than it has over the past 5 years’ … but we see that there was a significant reduction in output this morning around ~10:00. 7) We see a significant drop in hydro generation coincident with the price spike 8) Hydro storage levels are at ~30% in aggregate for Hydro Tasmania 9) We also see a significant drop in ‘ Market Demand ’ coincident with the price spike and wonder if this is due, in part, to Demand Response at spot-exposed major energy users (such as several of our clients we’ve been serving in TAS for a decade or more)? For more detail we look at this collage of a couple different widgets in ez2view today, time travelled back to the same 14:05 dispatch interval (i.e. so we don’t yet have the benefit of ‘next day public’ data (like bids), but are showing ‘end of interval’ metered values: With respect to these annotations: 10) We see Tamar Valley CCGT was not running at this time … not in the past 2 hours at least … and only BBTHREE1 and BBTHREE2 units burning gas 11) We can clearly see that hydro units in the North-West and West-Coast zones have been ‘ constrained down ’ 12) Reading the mouse-overs we see that this is due to the ‘T::T_HA_GT_PM_4’ constraint equation : (a) which the AEMO describes as (i.e. on the ‘Standing Data’ tab)… ‘Out = Hadspen to George Town or Hadspen to Palmerston 220 kV line, prevent poorly damped TAS North – South oscillations following fault and trip of Palmerston to Sheffield 220 kV line, Tamar CCGT out of service.’ (b) we see that the Basslink interconnector running strong southwards is one of the contributors to the hydro units being constrained down… i. i.e. it has a negative factor on the LHS, and flow south is negative. ii. so this provides a large positive contribution on the LHS (c) Not shown here, but we can use the ‘Constraint Dashboard’ widget in ez2view for the two FCAS constraints (i.e. the ‘F_MAIN++LREG_0210’ constraint equation and the ‘F_MAIN++APD_TL_L5’ constraint equation ) to surmise that: i. they are the ones leading NEMDE to direct flow strongly south, ii. … leading to hydro generation being constrained down iii. hence the ENERGY price popping. 13) We also see output from the 4 x Wind Farms in TAS highlighted is relatively modest: (a) potentially being ‘constrained down’ at Musselroe Wind Farm; (b) approximately 39% capacity factor at Woolnorth Wind Farm, which is Non-Scheduled ; (c) actually at 0MW for Granville Harbour Wind Farm, for reasons not explored at this point in time; and (d) Almost 0MW for Cattle Hill Wind Farm, for reasons not explored at this point in time.

There are plenty of individual articles that could be written – but for now here’s this one with a snapshot of ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view , filtered down to look at all the 44 x coal units remaining in the NEM: There are 44 remaining coal units still operating in the NEM (with performance analysed in detail in each GenInsights Quarterly Updates … alas we’re not yet finished for 2024 Q1 , being swamped with activities at present. Briefly with respect to the 4 stations/units highlighted: A) More machinations at Eraring It’s surprising to think that it was just over 3 weeks when the announcement was made about an extension to service for Eraring Power Station (22 days ago, on Thursday 23rd May 2024). Seems like an age in the electricity market! There’s clearly a couple stories highlighted in this display … will see if we can get to it later. B) Callide C4 return to service expectations steady The most recent MT PASA DUID Availability data still has the return to service expectation for Callide C4 set at Sunday 30th June 2024 (at part load) … which is great news. Only 16 days to go… But there have been other developments, as well… C) Tarong North trips Also highlighted here, we note that Tarong North has come offline just before 11:00 this morning, as shown in this snapshot of an email alert triggered by the ‘Notifications’ widget running in a display copy of ez2view for us: As shown on the first image, it’s currently slated to be offline through until Wednesday 3rd July 2024: 1) Not shown here, but visible in the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget , we find: (a) that the requirement to take an ‘Unplanned Forced Outage’ was reported to the AEMO sometime between 09:00 and 12:00 on Monday 10th June 2024. (b) the expected return to service date has bounced around slightly since that time … currently sitting at Wednesday 3rd July 2024. 2) I’ve not looked further, to see if the cause of the outage is visible in the bidding data. D) Yallourn unit 3 returns Obscured off the bottom of the image was the good news that Yallourn Unit 3 returned to service an hour after Tarong North came offline today … again via the ‘Notifications’ widget running in a display copy of ez2view for us: Remember this unit tripped offline on Friday 7th June 2024, as noted in ‘Eraring and Yallourn units offline on unplanned outages again’ .",

    "content": "Earlier this morning we noted ‘ Wind yield drops again, prices rise in VIC, SA and TAS … and gas-fired generation is running strong ’ … but it’s worth particularly noting the situation in Tasmania, which we show firstly with this trend of daily statistics for gas-fired generation in TAS looking back 10 years: This chart from NEMreview v7 clearly shows that the the last few days have seen the strongest block of gas-fired production in TAS since May 2019 … just over 5 years ago. Those with a licence to the software can open their own copy of this query here . In subsequent articles (time permitting) we might delve further into the reasons for this (i.e. hydro storage levels are relatively low … but how do they compare to historical levels, especially at the start of winter?). Out of curiosity, I edited a copy of the trend above to explicitly add in the daily average production from the ‘TVCC201’ unit (i.e. the Tamar Valley CCGT): This confirms that it’s the first time in just over 5 years that the combined cycle unit has seen a run ! — With a number of the commentators at Australian Energy Week speaking about the design challenges of the Capacity Investment Scheme (which some would see as ideologically driven, but logically inane for excluding gas-fired generation), this very intermittent – but very necessary – use of gas-fired generation in Tassie … 1) is another reminder of what most credible models of the energy transition find that a large installed capacity base is going to be required of gas-fired peaking plant; 2) but it’s not going to need to be run very often; … as noted in this paper from Simshauser and Gilmore , for instance 3) which means that the emissions from the plant will be quite low; 4) but the economics are going to need to stack up, meaning: (a) There’s going to need to be some incentive for the plant to be built and maintained; and (b) We’ll need to work out how to fuel it … with gas supply, and/or back-up liquid fuel or possibly even biofuels.

For instance, continuing the focus on the very mixed results for wind through April and May : 1) There’s been another burst of strong wind yield lasting ~2 days from the afternoon of 10th June into the afternoon of Wednesday 12th June (reaching ~7,000MW over a 12-hour period) 2) However that’s faded away again – as a result of which Thursday morning 13th June we’ve dropped under 1,000MW NEM-wide currently. We can see this, and many other things, in this snapshot of NEMwatch here at 08:25 this morning: With respect to the annotations: 1) Wind yield is particularly low in TAS, VIC and SA this morning … but also quite low in NSW and QLD 2) In contrast, it jumps out to me that Large Solar in QLD is performing strongly even at 08:25 on a winter’s morning (rooftop PV suffers more of a lag in rising each morning). 3) Partly as a result of the low wind yield, three’s plenty of gas-fired generation powering away: (a) Particularly in VIC and SA; (b) But perhaps most notably in TAS … (and particularly noting Tamar Valley CCGT running for the first time in >5 years ). 4) Prices in those gas-firing regions are elevated well beyond the old $300/MWh ASX cap trigger price level; 5) Also notable that the demand in TAS (being the last remaining winter peaking region … at least at this time, until it reverses) are quite elevated … (a) ‘ Market Demand ’ shown as 1,612MW (b) Well into the orange zone , compared to an all-time maximum of 1,781MW (also shown on NEMwatch). 6) Being winter now, we’re seeing an increased incidence of ‘forecast LORx ’ Market Notices from the AEMO for various regions.

    "content": "One news item that spiked my attention this morning was Colin Packham’s article ‘EnergyAustralia plagued by Tallawarra B gas station delays’ published in the Australian Sunday evening 9th July 2024: The article is well worth reading, for those who have access. I’d not specifically noted the (lack of) performance of this asset in articles previously (though we had noted the glitch in AEMO systems that occurred in relation to the unit hitting AEMO’s production systems ). So I quickly opened up the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget inside of ez2view this morning to quickly view the past 270 days of bidding and dispatch for the unit: Some notable dates: 1) The unit was registered in AEMO’s production systems on 10th October 2023; 2) In this article published 19th December 2023 ‘EnergyAustralia completes successful test fire of new gas power station’ ; 3) On 24th January 2024 we saw ‘First output at Tallawarra B’ ; 4) Not noted on the chart above, but useful to note that EnergyAustralia released the news item ‘EnergyAustralia opens Tallawarra B gas-fired power station’ on 19th February 2024; 5) Last period of non-zero availability in bids was 16th April 2024; 6) Which means the unit was not bid available during the period of volatility leading to Administered Pricing commencing on Wednesday 8th May 2024 . 7) Last Friday 7th June in this Operations Update , EnergyAustralia says: ‘Tallawarra B, EnergyAustralia’s new gas-peaking power station, is awaiting release’ When we use the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view , it’s most commonly focused on the coal units – but here’s the alternative view of the widget focused on gas-fired units, with the NSW units at the top of the table, and TALWB1 highlighted: Note the unit is currently slated to be operational from Saturday 22nd June 2024 . To gain some sense of how firm that date might be, I quickly opened up the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view and filtered down to the ‘TALWB1’ DUID and, after zooming in somewhat to reduce the initial 3-year view, see the following: Remember that this widget allows the user to ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to see ‘that other dimension of time’ . So we can see that the expected operations date (slated currently for 22nd June) has been pushed back a number of times in the past . We’ll aim to keep an eye on this one…",

Using the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget within ez2view at the 14:20 dispatch interval today we see the following: In the ‘Bid Table’ shown above it notes a few different physical limitations on the plant … but it’s not 100% clear which of these (or other?) are the reason for the outage. Not shown here, but a reference to the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget within ez2view suggests that the decision to add in this unplanned maintenance outage might have been made yesterday (Friday 7th June 2024). Yallourn unit 3 offline This unit came offline around midday Friday 7th June 2024 (~12 hours prior to Eraring unit 1), as captured in this alert from the ‘Notifications’ widget within ez2view : Using the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget within ez2view at the 14:20 dispatch interval today we see the following: From the last rebid shown in the list (at 10:47 on Friday 7th June) it appears the unit came offline with an Economiser Tube Leak . It was in this rebid that the operator signalled to the AEMO that the unit had to come offline shortly thereafter.",

    "title": "Welcome to the Power Station of the Future – But Take Care",
    "date": "07-06-2024 05:42:00 AM",
    "content": "This week our electricity system re-configures itself to accept hybrids, the Power Stations of the Future, the Holy Grail of dispatchable renewable energy. Fantastic. We just want to sound a warning and highlight some key new complexities so they can be avoided. Neither the power system nor the industry can afford too much trial and error. — This article is based on a presentation from Overwatch Energy’s Operations Manager, Ellise Janetzki, at the Australian Large Scale Solar and Storage Summit (ALSSSS) in Brisbane earlier this week – so this article focuses on solar, but the same generally applies to wind. References are kept to solar for simplicity and because of the status of self-forecasting in the solar sector. See here for more context on that issue. What Do We Mean by a Power Station of the Future? First some language. “ Integrating energy storage systems into the NEM ” or IESS is a complex reform with four major components. More details can be found here on the AEMO website , but we are going to concentrate on just one of those reforms, the introduction of a new type of participant to the NEM –the Integrated Resource Provider or IRP. Despite what you might sometimes hear, there are currently no IRPs (also sometimes known as hybrids) operating in the NEM. There are some configurations like the one below, but from an energy market perspective, this co-location means little. Figure 1. This is co-location. Two separate power stations When the assets are not sharing the same connection point, when they are not the same Dispatchable Unit ID, 10 meters apart might as well be 10km. And from an asset owner perspective, both assets are buying (charging) or selling (discharging or generating) at spot market prices. Short of throwing an extension cable over the fence, each asset is still dispatched separately into the market, with limited benefit gained from any surpluses or deficits from the other. They might share some civil infrastructure and environmental approvals that reduces the cost per MWh a fraction, but that’s largely it. Nothing futuristic to see here. The Future The future starts this week. For the first time we can now have genuinely dispatchable generation. Solar and wind can now supply into the grid with a degree of control they’ve never had before, and batteries can provide all the services they already do and discharge clean energy. It’s worth remembering that standalone batteries – batteries with no associated generation, are loads on the network. Valuable as they are, they make no direct contribution to the gazillion GW of clean generation we need. Figure 2. This is an IRP. A single power station. Why are Hybrids More Challenging? Let’ s start with what we know. A Solar Farm The market operations of a solar farm owner are relatively simple. Bidding strategies and outcomes are generally binary – on or off against a single energy price. You should check FCAS costs, market constraints and the availability of the site but it’s all very near-term, 5 minutes ahead at most. You’re Semi-Scheduled too, so unless there is a cap on you – a Semi-scheduled Dispatch Cap or SDC, then your output can and will vary with wind or solar resource. Figure 3. Solar Farm market operations – limited variables and time horizon; simples. Standalone Battery A standalone battery is a magnitude more complex than solar. The number of variables to account for and the times horizons are much more. Starting with your solar farm, add all the future markets pricing for energy and all the FCAS markets, and start thinking 24hrs ahead, not just 5 minutes. Think plant limitations too – battery cycling, and battery state of charge – now and in the future. Figure 4. Standalone BESS operations: think lots more variables, near and medium term. IRPs For Integrated Resource Providers, you need to take your BESS and your solar obligations and you need to integrate them. You need to think about everything a BESS needs and everything a solar farm needs and these two systems need to operate in an integrated manner. Each element needs to look accurately at the ‘right now’, but also forecast many hours ahead – for however far ahead you want to optimise your battery operations. Figure 5. IRP Operations. Take BESS operations and add yet more variables and forecasting. OK, so don’t I just plug my solar forecast into my battery? Well, yes, but here the problems start. A coal plant has more certainty of its fuel than you have of your solar resource; so does a gas or a hydro plant. The hardest resource to forecast is irradiance, it carries the highest uncertainty. And if that were not problem enough, most self-forecasting is now not striving for accuracy but instead gaming the causer-pays algorithm. Below is a very typical example of the discrepancies between actual production and a forecast production made only 5 minutes prior. You can see several deviations of 10-30% – several MW difference in many, many 5 of the minute trading intervals. Figure 6. Deviations in solar forecasting accuracy are currently frequent and significant So What? Why Does the Solar Forecast Need to be Better? The reason why the solar forecast needs to be a whole lot better than this is because the efficient operation – the financial returns of your whole asset and power system security, depend on good accuracy. Every 5 minutes your BESS control and trading software will be relying on your solar forecast to decide what to do in the next 5 minutes. What will it do each time your forecast is wrong? How will it respond to deviations of +/- 10-30%? We’re not entirely sure, but the implications could be multiple, and none of them are great. Your unit could fall short of it’s dispatch target, or the battery will have to compensate with it’s own charge or, if actual is more than you forecast , you may overshoot your dispatch target. The knock-on effects could include: less actual FCAS available than bid, so compliance and financial problems, being short of or wasting energy for arbitrage, or more cycling than forecast. It depends heavily on how you have configured the overall control strategy of the whole hybrid. And this is our point. If the implications of these forecasting errors have not even been contemplated, then at who’s expense will the trial and error be? And remember that this cycle is happening every 5 minutes, so 288 times every day. Rising to the Challenge We’ve little doubt that the technical risks described here are soluble, be that in better forecasting or developing BESS control and trading software that manages inaccuracy effectively. The warning we sound right now, the week that IESS/IRP becomes a thing in the market is as follows: BESS control and trading software is a separate specialism to solar (and wind) forecasting, Anecdotally, we understand BESS control and trading specialists may simply take a feed from the forecaster; it’s unclear how they will respond to inaccuracy, Solar forecasting is not focused on improving accuracy, Developers and owners of IRPs risk being stuck in the middle, between the BESS and the solar-forecasting teams. Are they aware of this and responding appropriately before they buy the kit and install it? If this article gives you cause to think and consider that you may need to act, then we leave you with the following suggested steps: Acknowledge that being Scheduled means greater compliance, that BESS dispatch and trading is likely to rely on your solar forecast and forecasting this accurately is key Understand that self-forecasting is not currently always focussed on accuracy, so figure out what that means for your hybrid Design , for BESS control systems that genuinely accommodate inaccuracy but strive to accurately forecast your solar resource Resource for more components, more interfaces, taking more responsibility, more testing and more time. Lead with human capital . Drive software development to support what you need. Don’t be led by software and don’t get left stuck in the middle of two software vendors with different agendas.

    "title": "Who’s who in the ESOO",
    "date": "03-06-2024 12:57:00 PM",
    "content": "Two weeks ago on Tuesday the 21st of May, the AEMO released an update to the latest Electricity Statement of Opportunities (ESOO) – a document that intends to inform planning and decision-making for new investment in the NEM. But in perhaps a sign of the times, 48 hours later the report and its modeling became partially outdated with the announcement of an extension to the was-soon-to-be-retired Eraring Power Station , the largest station in the NEM. The updated document superseded the original report released 9 months prior, and highlighted significant delays to major projects whilst simultaneously reporting the inclusion of 4.6 GW of sufficiently advanced projects over a longer time horizon. – In the 1942 Looney Tunes short ‘ Who’s Who in the Zoo ’ the narrator follows zookeeper Porky Pig, profiling different animals in a zoo and their oddities: a giraffe, a laughing hyena, etc. In the spirit of that cartoon, I will play the role of Porky Pig and identify the most intriguing projects that have changed statuses between the two versions of the ESOO. Hopefully, this will help our readers ponder the state of the project development pipeline, and the modelling that relies upon it. What’s changed? For context, the AEMO has three general categories in which they classify the status of new projects. These projects are assessed based on their procurement progress against five key criteria (land, contracts, planning, finance and construction). At a high-level, these three categories are: Committed – Projects that will proceed as they satisfy all five criteria. In some cases, projects are marked as committed but with an asterisk if they satisfy land, finance and construction criteria, and are in the process of finalising either contract or planning obligations. Anticipated – Projects that meet at least three of the five criteria. If the developer does not submit survey information back to the AEMO at least once every 6 months, the project is bumped back to ‘publicly announced’ or withdrawn from the database. Publicly Announced – Projects that have been announced/proposed by a developer. These do not necessarily need to meet any of the five key criteria. The ‘likelihood of proceeding’ of the projects within this category varies significantly. On page 44 of the original 2023 ESOO, the AEMO clarified that ‘anticipated’ projects had begun to be included in the reliability forecast (Central scenario), this was a shift as projects with this category had not been included in this forecast in previous years. As anticipated projects may not have submitted an expected completion date in their survey submission, the AEMO states that a modelling assumption was made in those cases, such that each is assumed to be completed at T-3 years (July 1st 2027). Delays Let’s start with identifying which projects have been delayed since the original ESOO 2023 in August. Colin Packham of the Australian recently reported that 15 of 76 new projects faced delays , by his count, since halfway through last year. Below I have attempted to put together my own list tracking down each of these delayed projects. In order to compile this list I’ve had to navigate and scrape various archived versions of the Generation Information Spreadsheet maintained by the AEMO. As others may have experienced, the spreadsheet is not the most user-friendly or dissectable dataset, especially for longitudinal analysis. I will elaborate on why that may be an issue in a follow-up Part 2 of this analysis, but in the meantime, if you spot any omissions or errors in the table below, then please leave a comment. ESOO 2023 Project Region Original (August 2023) May 2024 Update Network Project Energy Connect Stage 1 (150 MW Transfer Capacity) SA, NSW Expected July 2024 Expected November 2024 Project Energy Connect Stage 2 (800 MW Transfer Capacity) SA, NSW Expected July 2026 Expected July 2027 Central West Orana REZ Link NSW Expected September 2027 Expected August 2028 Generation Borumba Pumped Hydro (1,998 MW / 48,000 MWh) QLD Anticipated – Expected June 2030 Anticipated – Expected September 2031 Cultana Solar Farm (357 MW) SA Anticipated – Expected April 2026* Anticipated – Expected July 2026 Derby Solar Farm (95 MW) VIC Anticipated – Expected September 2024 Anticipated – Expected March 2025 Frasers Solar Farm (77 MW) VIC Anticipated – Expected November 2024 Anticipated – Expected October 2025 Gnarwarre BESS (290MW / 550MWh) VIC Anticipated – Expected June 2024 Anticipated – Expected January 2026 Melbourne Renewable Energy Hub A (600 MW / 1,600 MWh)** VIC Anticipated – Expected August 2025 Committed – Expected November 2025 New England Solar Farm BESS (50 MW / 50 MWh) NSW Anticipated – Expected June 2024 Anticipated – Expected December 2026 Orana BESS (408 MW / 1,660 MW) NSW Anticipated – Expected May 2025 Anticipated – Expected December 2026 Riverina Solar Farm (32 MW) NSW Committed – Expected June 2024 Committed – Expected June 2025 Sapphire Wind Farm BESS (30 MW / 38 MWh) NSW Anticipated – Expected December 2024 Anticipated – Expected June 2025 Templers BESS (111 MW / 291 MWh) SA Anticipated – Expected May 2025 Committed – Expected August 2025 Ulinda Park BESS (155 MW / 298 MWh) QLD Anticipated – Expected December 2024 Anticipated – Expected December 2025 Wunghnu Solar Farm (94 MW) VIC Committed – Expected August 2024 Committed – Expected October 2024 *Completion date has changed multiple times since the July 2023 update of the Generation Information dataset **Project structure has changed If you spot any errors or missing information in the table above, please leave a comment. As almost half of those generation projects are storage, it is worth noting: With respect to big batteries, we recently published an analysis examining the actual development timelines for each of the existing twenty big batteries in the NEM. The second graphic in that article highlighted that the nine most recent BESS projects had taken from 16 up to 26 months to go from financial close to full operations. With respect to pumped hydro, the shifting expected completion date of Snowy 2.0 has been well publicised . This is perhaps a lesson that anticipating a completion date for a project of that size and complexity is difficult. Leaving the market In addition to the announced 2-to-4-year extension of Eraring, announced two days after the release of the ESOO update, it was announced that three units will be leaving the market since the original ESOO. ESOO 2023 Project Region Original (August 2023) May 2024 Update Generation Torrens Island B Unit 1 (200 MW) SA Expected to return from mothballing in November 2024 Not Expected to Return (Closure in June 2026) Port Lincoln Diesel Generator (73.5 MW) SA In Service Mothballed and Not Expected to Return (Closure in January 2028) Snuggery Diesel Generator (63 MW) SA In Service Mothballed and Not Expected to Return (Closure in January 2028) If you spot any errors or missing information in the table above, please leave a comment. Newly progressed capacity The ESOO update highlighted that ‘4.6 GW of new capacity had advanced enough to be considered’ within their modelling. I won’t list these in this article but hope to cover each of these projects in Part 2 in coming weeks. A slightly longer view of development Below is a simplified Sankey diagram I’ve created using archived versions of the AEMO’s Generation Information spreadsheet. The diagram does not track flows of individual projects as some projects occasionally get withdrawn, have their status bumped back, or can skip steps – but rather, the diagram tracks the net change in flows from the four project stages. The net change between projects proposed and in service across the NEM between January 2022 to January 2024. Source: AEMO Generation Information As time permits I’ll endeavour to update and expand upon this diagram in future articles, but for now, two key points stand out: It’s clear that the amount of capacity ‘In Service’ and at the ‘Committed’ stage has largely stalled. If we consider just the capacity losses from eventual coal retirements, it’s hard to see how a net gain of 2.5 GW of new project committments over a two-year period is keeping up with the speed of the transition. The sheer volume of proposed projects dwarfs the number actually being progressed. Perhaps others more knowledgeable than myself could provide insight (via the comment section) as to whether this may be causing bottlenecks in itself? And their thoughts on whether this is an efficient allocation of resources and skills in terms of addressing the biggest problems in the energy transition (an honest question, not a statement). As the Australian reported yesterday , some industry executives have suggested that the incoming Capacity Investment Scheme may even further strangle development progress in the short-to-medium term, as developers face more variables and complexity when evaluating their bid parameters. Key Takeaways As time permits, I will publish a second instalment of this analysis, but from Part 1 today I’ll finish with a couple of takeaways: Projects already committed and anticipated continue to face delays. A significant number of these delays relate to storage projects. In that regard, it is a much different development environment from the ‘ 100 days or it’s free ’ promise that Elon Musk delivered seven years ago. We may be building anticipation faster than we’re actually building new projects. The disparity between the volume of proposed projects and those advancing through to completion should perhaps raise some concern about a ‘perception vs reality’ dilemma.",

Rather than try to find different words to explain it, for now let’s just copy in the AEMO’s answer to this question here under the ‘General FAQs’ : ‘Integrating energy storage systems into the National Electricity Market” (IESS) is a complex reform with four major components: 1) Market small generation aggregators able to provide contingency frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) – optional for Small Generation Aggregators 2) Aggregate systems (large-scale ‘hybrid’ plant) can opt into aggregated dispatch conformance – optional for aggregate systems 3) Material changes to the non-energy cost recovery framework leading to significant changes to NEM settlement table structures – affects all ‘financially responsible Market Participants’ 4) Registration, classification and bidding changes for scheduled Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)’ For more information: Readers might appreciate these resources: 1) There’s earlier articles about IESS collated under this heading here on WattClarity , and there will be more to come . 2) The AEMO Project Page for this reform also provides a great deal of information. 3) And of course there is the AEMC Rule Change page for IESS . 4) On a much more time-sensitive basis, those who are in Brisbane this Wednesday (5th June 2024) might hear more about hybrids (which are the subject of the rule change) in the afternoon session at the Clean Energy Council’s ‘Large Scale Solar & Storage Summit’ for 2024: Across the broader suite of companies we’re shareholders in and/or collaborate closely with, there’s a fair contingent of people there. For instance, Ellise Janetzki at Overwatch Energy is talking about ‘We Need to Talk About Being a Power Station (of the Future)’ . Will we see you there? For our (software) clients We’ve been working for some time on the implications of, and opportunities for, our clients with respect to various of our products and services. For instance, our ez2view clients are able to upgrade to the v9.9.3.351 Transition Release for the arrival of bi-directional units (we understand this most likely won’t be until July sometime). There’s even been releases since that time. Contact us directly, if you would like to know more…",

    "title": "More detail on the poor wind yield through (most of!) April and May 2024",
    "date": "01-06-2024 02:18:00 PM",
    "content": "Earlier today we wrote the seeming oxymoron: ‘Highest-ever wind yield … *and* worst wind yield since June 2017!’ when looking at wind production statistics firstly zoomed in (to three days at the end of May) and then zoomed out (to the 61 days over the 2-month period). To illustrate the disappointing yield (and also the significance of ‘three days of plenty’) we’ve utilised our NEMreview software to extract aggregate wind production statics (i.e. aggregate FinalMW for every dispatch interval) over this 61 day period for each of 5 similar time ranges: 1) April to May (61 days in total); 2) For five consecutive years (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024) With this data we’ve drawn these cumulative worm trends that start at 0MWh produced in the time range at the start of 1st April and trend upwards to the right as the 61 day period progresses: Firstly, let’s get some ( ‘no sh*t sherlock’ ) truisms out of the way firstly: 1) Obviously we’d expect each trend to continue upwards to the right, as it’s a cumulative trend; 2) Also obvious, we’d expect the worm lines won’t be perfect straight lines, as the underlying wind resource ( and market/system conditions leading to economic curtailment and network curtailment ) are all variable; 3) Because the installed capacity* base for Wind Farms across the NEM is growing , we’d expect each year to see each year producing more wind energy . * notwithstanding these complexities about measuring any power generation facilities ‘Installed Capacity’ to use as the denominator in this calculation. But obviously that’s not the case , because weather conditions (and possibly other factors) have intervened ! From a headline perspective we see the following… Comparing 2024 to 2023 Apart from the first few days in April (where early April 2023 was evidently low wind conditions) the worm for 2024 never exceeds the worm for 2023 … and indeed ends up substantially down on output: 1) Indeed, it’s 326,848MWh lower at the end of the 61 day period 2) That’s 7.8% lower across 61 days 3) Despite installed capacity being 921MW (or 8.8%) higher on 31st May 2024 compared to 12 months beforehand Comparing 2024 to 2022 Now, part of the reason is that (it’s been noted elsewhere) that same period in 2023 was particularly windy , so let’s compare to 2022: 1) Which was, at the end of the day: (a) 44,137MWh higher at the end of 31st May 2024 compared to 31st May 2022 (b) Which is 1.16% higher (c) But that’s with capacity being 1,504MW (or 15.3%) higher on 31st May 2024 compared to 24 months beforehand! 2) And the kicker is that we can clearly see with my (sketched in) approximation, if it was not for the 3-day run of wind gales at the end of May 2024 (that was only predictable 3-4 days in advance ), the aggregate worm line for 2024 would have been considerably lower : (a) Certainly well below the results for 2022 (b) And down much closer to the results for 2021. Comparing 2024 to 2021 Speaking of 2021, if we compare to actual results for 2024, we see: 1) Production was 522,118MWh (or 15.74% ) higher in 2024 compared to three years earlier 2) But that’s after a growth in installed capacity of 2,562MW ( or 29% ) on levels as at 31st May 2021. Comparing 2024 to 2020 Going all the way back to 2020 and comparing with 4 years later, we see: 1) Production was 658,291MWh (or 20.7% ) higher in 2024 compared to four years earlier 2) But that’s after a growth in installed capacity of 3,653MW (or 47% ) on levels as at 31st May 2020. So all of this points to how we invested a significant increase in installed capacity across 4 years for a much smaller benefit in energy production (and presumably also emissions reduction, though I have not checked directly), in the 61 day period. 1) Let’s hope, for all of our sakes, that the wind conditions turn around 2) But surely we need to bring the ‘A Team’ into planning for the required amount of firming capacity as coal units leave the grid! … reminds me that we flagged this specific challenge when covering ‘What’s next for market modelling’ as Key Observation #6 within GenInsights21 a few years ago now!",

    "date": "01-06-2024 11:31:00 AM",
    "content": "… it does not seem logical that both can be true , but (from our look at the numbers) it does appear to be ! Let’s explain how… Current wind yield, on Saturday 1st June 2024 Part of the story is where we are currently at, as captured in this snapshot from NEMwatch for the 10:30 dispatch interval on Saturday 1st June 2024: As noted on the snapshot, wind yield has been quite consistent at ~2,000MW for the past 12 hours – which is, at the same time: 1) Down considerably (by 4,000MW-6,500MW!) compared to recent days; but also 2) Up consistently (by ~1,500MW) by where it’s been on numerous periods the past two months. It blew a gale for ~3 days and saw a new all-time maximum Yesterday we wrote ‘How predictable is the wind (a short Case Study of Thursday evening 30th May 2024)?’ : That’s useful to refer to for two reasons: 1) First is to highlight that the AEMO had forecast that wind yield would drop rapidly from the peaks of the past few days overnight … which is what turned out to happen (even the current level closely matches the AEMO’s forecast for UIGF ) 2) But the first image in that article is also useful to illustrate that it blew a gale consistently for about 3 days : (a) With wind yield above 6,000MW for much of that time (b) Including a new all-time maximum point late (at 8,431MW) on Thursday evening 30th May . But wind yield through April and May 2024 was disappointingly low Even before that gale had started to build up (from Tuesday 28th May 2024 forwards) the past ~8 weeks had proved quite interesting, except at the other end of the scale with a consistent and long run of low wind yield across the NEM through April and May. I’d noted a number of times that I was waiting till the month of May had fully elapsed to produce an update on this long-range trend of monthly wind production statistics , and so here it is: Those with a licence to the NEMreview software can open their own copy of this query here . We’ve highlighted on this trend both the high point on an instantaneous basis, and the low points on an average monthly basis. With respect to the calculated capacity factor: 1) Recently: (a) For April 2024 it calculated as 22.37% ; whilst (b) For May 2024 it calculated as 23.52% … obviously given a boost by the gale that blew for three days at the end of the month (for another article we might look at how much was that boost ?) 2) We need to go all the way back to June 2017 to see a lower capacity factor: (a) That was almost exactly 7 years ago now, back with the notorious ‘Wind Drought’ . (b) We can see in the chart above that the capacity factor was much lower then … down at 15.92% (c) Remembering that there was much less geographical diversity of wind farms then (d) There was also much less price-based economic curtailment back then … though I can’t be sure about network curtailment without reviewing history in more detail, as the SA region ‘system strength’ constraints used to play a much more significant role in the past (can’t immediately recall if back that far). 3) Notable mentions (in terms of seasonal lows – i.e. all points below 25% ) go to the following months in between: (a) Nov 2023 at 24.89% (b) April 2021 at 23.66% (c) July 2020 at 24.30% (d) February 2020 at 24.85% (e) April 2018 at 24.46% So we see both April and May 2024 were worth highlighting … but especially given that they are consecutive months ! Caveats… Of course, frequent readers will remember: 1) these complexities about measuring any power generation facilities ‘Installed Capacity’ to use as the denominator in this calculation. 2) and also how Dan Lee wrote ‘Why capacity factor is an increasingly simplistic way to compare solar farm performance’ … with similar concerns relating to wind farms A very interesting 8-9 weeks that will be analysed further, as time permits…",

    "content": "Late on Tuesday, the weather gods pulled the plug at the bottom of the bath that was holding the stubborn high pressure system blocking wind patterns across the NEM for much of April and May 2024 . The increasing gurgling sound coming as that system drained away was the sound of increasing wind harvest patterns: 1) began on Tuesday 28th May ; and 2) gained a boost on Wednesday 29th May and 3) reached a new all-time maximum point late on Thursday 30th May ; 4) before declining – gently at first, with the forecast for this afternoon (Friday 31st May) to be a steep fall in output. That leaves a solid block of output spanning ~3 days at the end of a ~60 day period that was notably disappointing in terms of yield. We can see this in this trend here from the ‘Trends Engine’ within ez2view : Another representation of the same wind yield pattern is this colourful grid view from the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget within the ez2view software, which we’ve time-travelled back to the 21:00 dispatch interval on Thursday , which was the dispatch interval at the end of which the new all-time maximum point was set: Remember that this widget allows the user to ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to see ‘ that other dimension of time ’. I’ve annotated this image with 6 numbers – with 4 points matching the notes above and the other two points being as follows: 5) Late on Tuesday 28th May, the AEMO’s ST PASA forecasts for NEM-wide UIGF for Wind was that the capability to produce power from wind would be ramping up to a maximum of around 7,000MW late on Thursday evening 30th May 2024. Indeed, if you trace your finger down that vertical to the start of the brighter colours, you can see why it was Monday 27th May morning that we were able to write ‘There might be a sustained burst of wind generation to finish off the month of May 2024’ . So: (a) Roughly three days out, AEMO had some foresight that we were going to see a ramp up in wind yield; (b) And as at Tuesday 28th May, the forecast yield capability (7,000MW) was only 1,400MW below what the yield actually turned out to be. (c) So perhaps some stakeholders might think ‘not too bad’ , in terms of a forecast. 6) However if we wind back another ~4 days to early Friday morning 24th May (i.e. ~7 days before the peak in wind on Thursday 30th May 2024): (a) we see that the AEMO forecast for aggregate wind yield capability would be roughly ~2,200MW (so down in the ‘blue’ zone). (b) so a massive miss by ~6,200MW of what the yield was going to be , 7 days in advance. Now different readers will have different perspectives of what the above picture means for the predictability of the wind resource … with perspectives perhaps different as a result of the different hats that they might be working (e.g. concerned about system reliability and/or security, or focused on particular commercial merits/risks relating to particular projects (either VRE or firming). … glass half full, or glass half empty?",

This is captured in this NEMwatch for the 20:40 dispatch interval: For those who have been following us here on WattClarity , that’s in excess of what was the the all-time record for wind production of 8,132MW (set at 19:20 on Friday evening 7th July 2023) . We’ll check back in the morning to see how much further this has climbed… PS1 … later Thursday evening 30th May 2024 At this point it looks like: 1) The highest point this evening (at least thus far) was at 8,431MW … SCADA snapshot at 21:00 (so InitialMW for the 21:05 dispatch interval) 2) and the wind production has slowly started to decline",

    "date": "30-05-2024 12:05:00 PM",
    "content": "Well, isn’t this a turn-up? In various articles through April 2024 and May 2024 we’ve noted how those months have been quite disappointing in terms of aggregate yield from wind farms across the NEM … both seasonally low, but also lower than expected during ‘normal’ autumn periods. Easily the highest wind yield for May 2024 (thus far!) Yesterday morning we wrote a first pass of ‘(Easily* the) highest aggregate wind production, thus far in May 2024’ . But this burst of wind production over the past ~24 hours has a little bit further to run … such as shown in this snapshot from NEMwatch at 10:05 on Thursday 30th May 2024 : On this snapshot we see: 1) A solid mass of green (i.e. wind) generation across the past 12 hours … it seems like ages since we have seen so much! 2) Looking in more detail, we see that the peak (thus far) was as high as 7,761MW this morning … the SCADA snapshot at ~07:40 for the start of the 07:45 dispatch interval 3) That maximum point (at least at this point – see below) (a) Was only 371MW below the all-time maximum production (when the aggregate wind production peaked at 8,132MW at 19:20 on Friday evening 7th July 2023 ). (b) Is more than 2,500MW higher than any other wind yields in May 2024 apart from this current burst (the next-highest was back on 5th May 2024). What a remarkable month! But wait, there could be more… Even more interesting, AEMO’s current forecasts for UIGF suggest that the underlying wind resource might have the capacity to drive the wind yield as high as 7,940MW in the half-hour ending 23:00 tonight. We can see this in this snapshot from the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in our ez2view software at the 11:30 dispatch interval this morning: Looking forwards 12 hours to the middle of the night this evening: 1) We see that the AEMO’s forecasts for what the aggregate (i.e. energy-constrained) capability might be to produce power this evening have enormous range : (a) The highest forecast that’s been produced was the one published by AEMO for 11:00 this morning (i.e. the most recent one, at this point) says that it might be at 7,940MW (i.e. only 192MW lower than the all-time maximum); but also (b) The lowest forecasts for the same point tonight suggested only ~2,200MW of capability back on Friday 24th May (c) That’s an increase in forecast of ~5,500MW over ~6 days (i.e. actual yield 360% of the earlier forecasts) (d) You can see (by comparison) what the forecast was back on Monday morning 27th May when we wrote ‘There might be a sustained burst of wind generation to finish off the month of May 2024’ . (d) A useful time to remember to sanity check the increasingly vocal (but perhaps simplistic?) statements by some that ‘VRE resource is very predictable’ .: i. In this case the uprating of the forecast has been good news (i.e. more wind than expected) … perhaps except for some participants ii. But there are also similar cases where the forecasts have gone in the other direction . There are other articles collated here that speak to this particular part of the challenge for the emerging requirements for firming capacity . 2) Keep in mind that this UIGF speaks to the capacity of the underlying energy resource to produce power … but understand that it’s quite likely that there will be curtailment that means this actual wind harvest is less than the underlying capability. … remember that Dan Lee has written two quite useful articles recently about curtailment of wind (and solar) following from the release of the GSD2023 : (a) On 7th March 2024 Dan wrote ‘Keeping Up with the Curtailment: 3.7TWh of semi-scheduled economic and network curtailment estimated in 2023’ ; and then (b) On 2nd May 2024 Dan followed that with ‘Keeping Up with the Curtailment Part 2: The what and the where’ . (c) And there are other useful articles about ‘Curtailment of VRE’ collated here . We’ll see how high it actually gets, overnight …",

    "title": "What impact did the extension to Eraring have on traded prices for NSW Futures?",
    "date": "30-05-2024 08:43:00 AM",
    "content": "Seven days ago (on Thursday morning 23rd May 2024) we wrote ‘Eraring Power Station closure delayed by 2 years (or maybe 4?)’ about the agreement reached to extend the service life at the station. In the days since, I’ve been wondering what impact this decision (whilst strongly rumoured in advance) might have had on the futures market . So I opened up the same NEMreview v7 query that we’ve already used through this quarter in order to take an updated look at recent days: For those with their own licensed access to the software, they can open their own copy of this trend here . With respect to the complexity in this trend… Earlier references I’ve annotated the chart with a couple references to earlier articles that also looked at the same data to that point, including… On Wednesday morning 8th May we’d written ‘More considerations, about the possible extension of Eraring Power Station’ … and noted: ‘There certainly does seem to be a drop in all of the 8 x Base Load contracts I have selected that is coincident with the rumours being published at the Guardian, and hence circulated on WattClarity and elsewhere. However I wonder if this was the only trigger … as we see that Base Load contracts for 2025 Q1 and 2025 Q2 also dropped at the same time ? Given Eraring was always assumed to be available on those quarters, I don’t immediately understand why news of an extension to operation through 2025 Q3 and beyond that would have fed into the futures market (though never say never, as it does trade on sentiment, amongst other things!).’ On Tuesday 14th May we’d written ‘Spot price volatility in May 2024 in NSW flows through to ‘baseload’ futures prices’ . … at this point ‘we clearly see the price jumping up with each burst of spot price volatility …’ On Friday 17th May 2024 we’d written ‘Some yo-yo action in NSW baseload electricity futures’ . … noting ‘This clearly shows the drop in traded price for 2024 Q2 baseload contracts in NSW (and also the future quarters … traders trading on sentiment, as noted before) on Wednesday 15th and Thursday 16th May 2024.’ As noted above, on Thursday morning 23rd May 2024 we wrote ‘Eraring Power Station closure delayed by 2 years (or maybe 4?)’ … but have not had a chance to look further at the futures market until today (7 days later). So is it any clearer? In the articles above we’ve written about two factors that (we hypothesize) have flowed through to traded contract prices for quarters beyond 2024 Q2: Factor 1 = the underlying volatility in the spot price during this period; but also Factor 2 = the ongoing machinations about what’s going to happen at Eraring Other Factors = but don’t forget that it’s likely there are other factors as well, playing on the minds of the various traders that drive these outcomes. Clearly there are other factors at play , because (since the Eraring extension announcement) the contracts for earlier quarters (i.e. when Eraring was going to be operating anyway) have traded much in line with the later quarters (i.e. which now get a boost of having Eraring still available – albeit with possible flow-on effects on delays on other new supply sources). It is worth noting that the futures price dropped noticeably coincident with rumours in the Guardian that the station would be extended … and yet has mostly risen since the actual announcement of the extension decision. What is it they say … ‘ sell on a rumour, buy on a fact’ ?",

    "date": "25-05-2024 06:06:00 PM",
    "content": "The evolving run of low wind yield in evenings after sunset what was documented on Thursday 23rd May and Friday 24th May has continued into Saturday 25th May (i.e. at least 3rd day in a row), as seen in this NEMwatch snapshot at 17:20 ( NEM time ): At this time, the solar yield is pretty much gone and prices are healthy … but yet the aggregate wind yield right across the NEM (though it has ramped up slightly) is just at 500MW . In other recent articles we’ve cautioned that this low wind might be a result of a combination of factors: 1) Including, of course, low underlying resource for wind; 2) But also including curtailment (for network or economic reasons), as Dan illustrated here with respect to 8th May 2024 in NSW . How much impact might curtailment be having? Curiosity got the better of me with particular respect of this evening , so I quickly flipped to this snapshot of ez2view for the 17:30 dispatch interval that provides more context: With this snapshot we can see that: 1) Unless there’s some ‘Private Constraint’ we can’t see in real time, there is zero ‘ network curtailment ’ affecting the output of the wind farms 2) Price are healthy in all regions, which suggests also zero ‘ economic curtailment ’ … though noting that there might have been some in QLD during the middle of the day 3) Which means that the low wind yield this evening is wholly due to low wind conditions (i.e. becalmed across almost the whole of the NEM ). (a) The only bright light across all the wind farms I saw in a brief scan of each region schematic was that of Mt Emerald Wind Farm in far north Queensland, which is running at ~50% capacity factor (b) But note that (on quick glance) the same does not seem the same for Kaban Wind Farm (is it still in commissioning?) or Kennedy Wind Farm, so would need to look in more detail at local conditions in northern Queensland to understand more… Ideality meets Reality? This week’s already been one where it seems, to some extent, that ideality has come crashing into a bit of reality – both with: Reminder #1) The AEMO’s update to the 2023 ESOO has both: (a) painted a less rosy picture of the forecast supply-demand balance in the coming couple of years i. In part because of delays on delivery on a number of different projects ii. Speaking of which, Colin Packham’s article Friday evening ‘ Nearly 20pc of Australia’s most advanced renewable projects have suffered delays in last year ‘ in the Australian explores these challenges. (b) but also included, for the first time (at least in my recollection), included coverage of certain aspects of ‘Keeping the Lights on Services’ such as System Strength services: i. The inclusion of which should be highly commended (I look forward to seeing more of this in the 2024 ESOO) ii. But which reminds of other challenges for the accelerated closure of coal. Reminder #2) This wake-up call from the AEMO then fed into (along with other inputs) the decision to contract for the extension to operations to Eraring Power Station . Reminder #3) So perhaps we could add this succession of ‘low wind during sunset peak demand times’ as one more reminder that reality’s more complicated than more simplistic models … How low might the long-range stats be for April and May 2024?! There’s just under one week left until the end of the month … after which time I’ll be keen to update these long-range stats for wind production to see how low the aggregate levels of production have been through April 2024 and May 2024…",

Those are the only three clear answers from almost four hours of Dr Brady’s examination in front of the Federal Court on Monday by lawyers for FTI Consulting’s John Park, appointed by the court in January as a special purpose administrator to the collapsed company that owned half of the power station.’ … and the rest of the article is well worth a read 2) I noted that the MEU followed on from the decision above with ‘Callide Power Station workers call for transparency around explosion cause before restarting unit ’ on Wednesday 22nd May. 3) Then on Thursday 23rd May (i.e. yesterday afternoon) Angelica Snowden and Nick Evans wrote ‘Callide C sale delayed after go-slow on explosion report and court dates’ in the Australian. … this article is also worth a read. Court References Remember that there are a couple different matters related to Callide C4 (and Callide C3 ) in the Federal Court at present: QUD61/2024 … by Sev.En (part owner of part owner) In several articles we’ve highlighted updates on the Court Case referred to in Nick’s articles above … most recently on 29th January 2024 with ‘Federal Court rules about Callide C – independent investigation authorised’ . In this case the Federal Court website reference is here (docket number QUD541/2023) . QUD61/2024 … by the AER On 9th February 2024 we wrote ‘The matter of Callide C back in Federal Court (this time via AER)’ … and that the relevant reference Number appears to be QUD61/2024 . Updates from Stakeholders With respect to the key stakeholders: (a) At CS Energy I could not see anything on the news section of the CS Energy website … nor did I see any updates here on the company profile LinkedIn . … but we did find this ‘Video, from CS Energy, of the installation of new turbine and generator stator at Callide C4’ . (b) At Sev.en Global Investments I also did not see anything under ‘Press Releases’ or ‘News Highlights’ on the 7GI website.",

    "content": "Earlier today we saw the announcement of the delay to closure of Eraring Power Station . As the sun sets for the day, I still have a few things left on the ‘to do’ list for the day – but could not help noticing that the aggregate wind yield across the NEM has dipped to under 500MW at the same time as the sun is setting ( somewhat related to one reason for the news this morning). This we see in this snapshot from NEMwatch at the 17:10 dispatch interval, NEM time : Perhaps it’s just my selective memory, but my sense is I’ve been seeing more instances of low aggregate wind yield in May and April beforehand ( including this stretch ) than I ordinarily would. … for instance at 16:20 the aggregate wind yield across all wind farms for which AEMO publishes data was 398MW (i.e. FinalMW): (a) Which, with an installed capacity base of 11,347MW ( remembering these caveats ) is an instantaneous capacity factor of only 3.5% (b) Though it should be noted that the aggregate solar yield was not zero at that point (albeit down to 3,225MW across Small and Large, remembering Medium is invisible ) A reminder to me to update these long-range stats for wind production . in the coming weeks (i.e. after we’ve seen May in its entirety). Those not so familiar with the machinations of the NEM should recall that low wind might be a result of a combination of factors: 1) Including, of course, low underlying resource for wind; 2) But also including curtailment (for network or economic reasons), as Dan illustrated here with respect to 8th May 2024 in NSW . Nothing further, at this point.",

    "date": "23-05-2024 10:46:00 AM",
    "content": "In a logical decision, mooted long in advance & which will surprise almost no-one, it’s being reported on Thursday morning 23rd May 2024 that the NSW Government and Origin Energy have announced that they have reached agreement to extend the services life of Eraring Power Station by a further two years. 1) The station was slated to close (all four units at the same time) on 19th August 2025 2) With this news update, we’d expect to see in the ‘MT PASA DUID Availability’ Widget in ez2view (with the AEMO data update for 12:00), we see that this has been extended out to ‘at least’ August 2027… … but all we have at present is this snapshot with the AEMO data update for 09:00, in which the closure date is still sitting at 19th August 2025: So we’ll have to wait a bit more to see if reflected in the market data*… * and, on that note, one of the team joked this morning that we’re yet to see a news media release titled “AEMO releases final final May ESOO update to reflect the delay to Eraring’s closure.”… so soon after Tuesday’s news . (A) Primary sources of information Let’s start by going straight to the two sources of the information, as follows: NSW Government Origin Energy Straight from the horse’s mouth, as it were, is the release from the NSW Government ‘NSW Government secures two-year extension to Eraring Power Station to manage reliability and price risks’ here: Interesting details include: ‘The state will not make upfront payments to Origin Energy to operate Eraring. Instead, the Government and Origin have agreed to an underwriting arrangement that requires the company to: Decide by 31 March in 2025 and 2026 whether it wishes to opt in to the underwriting arrangement for the following financial year. Share up to $40 million per year of any profits it earns from Eraring, if it does opt in. Claim no more than 80% of losses Eraring makes from its operations from the NSW Government, capped at $225 million each year , if it does opt in. Report the profits or losses it makes from Eraring in its annual report for each year, if it does opt in. Under the agreement, Origin must also: Ensure Eraring endeavours to generate at least 6 terawatt hours each year, the equivalent to the typical annual output of two of Eraring’s four generating units and enough to resolve the forecast reliability gap. Substantially maintain Eraring’s existing workforce of around 220 people, commit to a maintenance plan and adhere to its licence conditions, which includes environmental protections. Origin has given notice it now expects to close Eraring on 19 August 2027 . The permanent closure will be managed by Origin in line with its obligations under the National Energy Market and must occur before April 2029 . This ensures Eraring’s closure will contribute to NSW meeting its legislated 2030 emissions reduction target.’ On the other side of the negotiation was Origin Energy, who has released ‘Origin and NSW Government agree to delay closure of Eraring Power Station’ here: Origin notes … ‘Under the Generator Engagement Project Agreement (GEPA) Origin has agreed to extend operations at Eraring to 19 August 2027. Origin has submitted a revised notice for closure to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) consistent with this timing.’ … but (see ez2view snapshot above above) the notice to AEMO was later than required to be in their update for 09:00 this morning, so will presumably be in the AEMO update for 12:00. Continues… ‘Under the terms of the GEPA, Origin may receive compensation from the State to help cover the cost of Eraring’s operations and will endeavour to generate at least 6 TWh of electricity during each of the extension periods of FY2026 and FY2027. To be eligible to receive compensation, Origin must advise the State by March whether it will trigger the GEPA for the coming financial year. If the GEPA is triggered, Origin may recover a portion of Eraring losses calculated for that financial year using an agreed formula that takes into consideration the extent to which the plant’s operating and capital costs exceed an agreed revenue profile, capped at $225 million per annum . In the event Eraring operations are profitable during that period, Origin will pay the NSW Government 20 per cent of Eraring’s agreed profit, capped at $40 million per annum .’ … and there is more to read there… There’s probably more to come, from each … (B) Media Reporting So far today I have come across commentary in a range of places, including the following: 1) Here on WattClarity ®: (a) There’s this note, obviously (b) But there’s also a long history of articles collated here about ‘Closure of Eraring’ . 2) In Energy Source & Distribution I have seen… (a) This was the first article I saw this morning, with ‘Origin strikes deal with govt to delay Eraring closure’ . 3) In the Australian I have seen… (a) In an evolving story online in the Australia, Colin Packham writes ‘Eraring to stay open at least two more years’ (b) Then Colin Packham wrote ‘NSW’s largest coal power station extended by at least two years’ . (c) At 19:03 on Thu 23rd May, Glenda Korporaal wrote ‘Clear air ahead for Origin after Eraring deal’ . (d) At 00:00 on Fri 24th May the Editorial says ‘Eraring deal welcome sign of pragmatic Labor Right’ : (e) More to come, perhaps … 4) In the AFR I have seen… (a) Also top of the scroll on the AFR online this morning is Campbell Kwan writing ‘NSW-Origin deal the culmination of difficult negotiations’ : (b) Then Ben Potter (and Elouise Fowler joining, as the story grew) wrote what hit the front page in print on Friday as ‘Coal plant could ‘limp into the 2030s’’ : IMAGE TO COME (c) Anthony Macdonald (as Chanticleer) wrote ‘Why NSW had to underwrite Origin’s coal-fired plant’ . (d) Jennifer Hewett wrote what was titled in Friday’s print edition ‘Coal’s staying power another wake-up call’ . (e) More to come, perhaps … 5) In the Guardian I have seen … (a) At 08:35 this morning Peter Hannam wrote ‘NSW government extends life of Australia’s biggest coal-fired power station by two years to 2027’ . (b) Nothing else, at this point… 6) In SMH and the Age I have seen … (a) Alexandra Smith wrote ‘NSW government throws Eraring power station a lifeline until 2027’ . (b) Thursday afternoon there was also ‘The Eraring bill will max out at $450 million. It’ll be much worse if the lights go out’ . (c) Nothing else, at this point… 7) In RenewEconomy I have seen … (a) Giles Parkinson wrote ‘Eraring coal closure delayed two years, possibly four, “to keep the lights on”’ . (b) More to come, probably … 8) In PV Magazine I have seen … (a) Nothing at present. (b) Nothing else, at this point… 9) In the ABC I have seen … (a) Holly Tregenza and Isobel Roe wrote ’Australia’s largest coal-fired power plant Eraring in Lake Macquarie to stay open for two extra years’ (b) Nothing else, at this point… As a reader here, if you come across any other useful commentary, feel free to add as a comment below. (C) Comments from industry organisations following the news As time permits, we might add in references to this from various industry organisations: 1) From WHO? (a) Nothing at this point. (D) Social Media commentary about this As time permits, we might add in references to the Update to the ESOO (we see) in various social media feeds: 1) Firstly, from us: (a) Following this article we noted this on this Twitter Update and in this LinkedIn Update ; (b) With more to come… 2) In a quick lunchtime scan of social media, I noted the following comments might be of interest to readers here: (a) Dave Smith has added a comment to a LinkedIn update by Giles Parkinson … might be worth watching what follows. (b) Christian Zuur has added his own comments and questions via LinkedIn. (c) Dylan McConnell has linked back to an old conversation thread on Twitter (d) David Osmond has added his own thoughts via LinkedIn (E) Logic of the extension Two days ago (Tue 21st May) saw the AEMO publish an update to the 2023 ESOO , and it has garnered a bit of attention. I had time to read it last night and a number of things jumped out at me (more on other things later), including this line on p43/46: ‘System strength shortfalls of 1,420 megavolt amperes (MVA) and 1,165 MVA are forecast at Newcastle and Sydney West respectively from 1 July 20 25, …’ Now 1st July 2025 was before Eraring had been slated to close … but surely it would be apparent to everyone that the Eraring closure would not have helped, and would likely have exacerbated this issue? Yet we have heard next-to-nothing about those types of considerations about ‘Keeping the Lights on Services’ from those who have been pleading that ‘everything will be ok if Eraring closes in August 2025’. As noted above, there’s been prior discussion in articles collated here about ‘Closure of Eraring’ .",

    "title": "A brief look at NSW volatility at 18:10 on Monday 20th May 2024",
    "date": "21-05-2024 03:52:00 PM",
    "content": "Yesterday evening we briefly noted ‘Price volatility in NSW on Monday evening 20th May 2024’ with a snapshot of the 18:20 dispatch interval ( NEM time ). This morning I was having a conversation with someone about some activity they had noted with the Queanbeyan BESS, which displayed very start-stop output profile even during the volatility. So I said I would have a quick look (apologies that this is a bit quick-and-cryptic). In doing so I am using a soon-to-be-released v9.9.3 ‘Transition Release’ of ez2view for the IESS changes : 1) that notionally go live in the market on Monday 3rd June 2024 2) but which will moreso start affecting our ez2view clients when the first bi-directional units start appearing (which we understand won’t be until the end of June 2024 at the earliest ). Here’s three screenshots in sequence, all time-travelled back to the 18:10 dispatch interval The NSW Schematic + more To set the scene, here’s the ‘NSW Schematic’ widget and others in the ez2view software, at 18:10 on Monday 21st May 2024: With respect to the annotations: 1) This is an early build (we’re testing internally) of what will be the ‘Transition Release’ for IESS; 2) We’ve noted that Vales Point 6 was offline at this time, but returned to service overnight … a little earlier than expected . 3) We’ve highlighted Crookwell 3 Wind Farm was not registered (in AEMO production systems) at the time of the snapshot above: (a) But hit AEMO production systems at 24:00 at the end of this day (i.e. at midnight this morning) (b) The 4-hour overlap to the end of the ‘yesterday’ Market Day was the cause of the AEMO bug (GR case ref #6723) referenced here 4) The WattClarity reader this morning asked about the start-stop-start operating profile for Queanbeyan BESS highlighted. The ‘Station Details’ widget So drilling into the ‘Station Details’ widget in the ez2view software, at 18:10 on Monday 21st May 2024: For this dispatch interval, we see that the unit is dispatched down to 0MW even though the RRP is high and the volume is bid down at the –$1,000/MWh Market Price Floor at the Regional Reference Node. The reason for this is seen to be: 1) The ‘N::N_CTYS_2’ constraint equation 2) Which has driven the CPD Price down below –$1,000/MWh . The ‘Station Details’ widget Now frequent readers will recall that the ‘N::N_CTYS_2’ constraint equation has featured before in articles … such as with respect to Wednesday 8th May 2024 in ‘A quick look at the ‘N::N_CTYS_2’ constraint equation, with respect to Wednesday 8th May 2024’ . So clicking through to the ‘Constraint Dashboard’ widget in the ez2view software, we have some understanding of what we expect to find: As indicated on the image, there are a fair number of units (including QBYNBG1) that are being ‘constrained down’ by the ‘N::N_CTYS_2’ constraint equation (possibly working in conjunction with other bound constraints). That’s all for now …",

(3) In 2023, the AEMO released the ESOO 2023 (on 31st August 2023) … but it’s almost exactly 8 months later (i.e. later than the 2 prior years above) that they publish the the ESOO 2023 Update (on 21st May 2024). (4) That means we’re also just 4 months from the release of the ESOO 2024 (on 31st August 2024). Readers here can access the report, and accompanying materials, as follows: The Report Other Materials You can download the 46-page PDF of the Update here: Earlier copies of the ESOO are also available on this page on the AEMO website . With respect to this release of the ESOO, readers might like to note the following: (A) What AEMO notes about the report In this Media Release titled ‘Urgent investment needed for electricity reliability’ (which is an almost identical title to the Media Release used 10 months ago ), the AEMO notes: ‘The update was triggered due to material changes impacting reliability risks since the 2023 ESOO was published last August, including new commissioning dates for Project EnergyConnect , and mothballed gas and diesel generators in South Australia . The addition of approximately 4.6 gigawatts (GW) of new generation and storage projects that have sufficiently advanced was also considered in this ESOO update. ’ (B) What’s the purpose of the ESOO?

NSW’s transmission business Transgrid has been diligently navigating its way through new regulatory processes to supply these services that used to come free with every coal generator. In their System Security Roadmap, Transgrid politely observe the transition to a renewables-based system will create an “exponential increase in complexity”.

    "title": "Vales Point 6 unit back online earlier than expected … Tuesday morning 21st May 2024",
    "date": "21-05-2024 09:16:00 AM",
    "content": "On waking up this morning I noted this ez2view ‘Notifications’ alert telling me that Vales Point 6 unit started coming back online overnight: In real time the only data that’s visible in the ‘public’ data set, with respect to unit output, is the SCADA snapshot at the start of each dispatch interval … which we refer to as ‘Initial MW’ . So this alert is saying hat the unit was at 0MW at 02:25 and had ramped up to 6MW by the SCADA snapshot at ~02:30 … presumably on its way further upwards. The past 7 days, via ‘Bids & Offers’ widget In order to see more, I’ve opened up the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view and filtered down to just the VP6 unit, looking back 7 days: Eagle eyes will have spotted the fact that there’s no bids shown for the VP6 unit from the 02:30 start time this morning through until the 04:00 end of yesterday’s Market Day: 1) This relates to what we suspect is a bug in the AEMO’s internal systems when new units appear, such as WELNSF1 and CROOKWF3 from 00:00 this morning (we’re working this through with the AEMO under GR case ref #6723 ); 2) A useful point to remind readers that issues like this (i.e. a delay to publishing ‘yesterday’s bids’ such as in this case) should be updated, when they occur, on our Status Page here: A quick look at the ‘Generator Outages’ widget Last Saturday 18th May we’d written ‘Both Eraring 2 and Vales Point 6 will be offline for a few more days’ noting that the outage plans for Vales Point would be offline till Thursday 23rd May 2024 (i.e. in 2 days time). So it was a welcome surprise to see the unit restart commence this morning. That prompts me to open up the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view (my copy is filtered to just look at coal units, but can look at any Scheduled unit … unfortunately not for Semi-Scheduled unit because of a deficiency in this ERM Rule change) and have a look at what’s shown there with respect to Vales Point 6: With respect to the numbered annotations: 1) The highlighted three columns show various data with respect to the current Market Day … headline is that the unit’s back online. 2) We see that the unit tripped offline on Friday 17th May 2024 , so its availability for Sat 18th may was 0MW for the whole day 3) We see (in the ‘stale’ MT PASA DUID Availability data published for 18:00 on Sat 18th May) that the unit was not forecast to be back until Thursday 23rd May . 4) There’s a blank column for yesterday’s Market Day because of the AEMO bug (Case #6723) we are still working to resolve with them 5) In other good news, we see that the unit availability is forecast to be back to the full 660MW … so presumably Delta Electricity has used the outage to fix whatever the issues were with the Primary Air Fans (PA Fans) that was noted here .",

    "title": "Case Study of 14:15 on Thursday 22nd February 2024 (large collective under-performance across all Semi-Scheduled units)",
    "date": "19-05-2024 04:18:00 PM",
    "content": "Earlier today we posted ‘ Aggregate Dispatch Error across all Semi-Scheduled units (NEM-wide) throughout Thursday 22nd February 2024 ’ in the process of fleshing out some analysis about ‘ Aggregate Raw Off-Target ’ for all Semi-Scheduled units for the latest iteration of our GenInsights Quarterly Update series . In that article: 1) we flagged four particular dispatch intervals with Aggregate Dispatch Error calculating out as above 500MW across all Semi-Scheduled units (i.e. collective under-performance greater than 500MW compared to Target). 2) of those four particular dispatch intervals, the largest deviation was at 14:15 NEM time (Aggregate Dispatch Error = +653MW ). (a) Which you can see shared referenced historically is a large (but not the largest instance) (b) Indeed, is not even the largest in 2024 Q1 … but interesting for other reasons… A quick scan across all Semi-Scheduled units Let’s start with this graphical representation of the calculated Dispatch Error for all Semi-Scheduled units that were operational at that time (there were 167 x units): We’ve organised these units firstly by region (as shown) then dividing Solar and Wind, and then alphabetically by DUID … though I won’t expect you to read the DUIDs, as they need to be super-small to list them all. What’s particularly noticeable is that: 1) Of the units, there are far more instances of under-performance than over-performance … which (as noted before) is not a surprise given the one-sided way the Semi-Scheduled category works. 2) Particularly with respect to large deviations, there are 4 x Solar Farms in NSW that contribute about half of the +653MW underperformance. (a) So it’s logical to wonder if there was some weather effect that impacted output at these units. (b) Also worth noting that the 14:15 dispatch interval was the first of the four large deviations noted through the afternoon . Four NSW Solar Farms with large deviations Reaching for the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view and time-travelled back to the end of the day on Thursday 22nd February 2024 but looking backwards 24 hours, we’ll walk through each of these DUIDs in sequence. We’ll walk downwards in order of significance: Sunraysia Solar Farm (SUNRSF1) With this snapshot it’s quite apparent that the output pattern through the morning was quite smooth, but then quite choppy through the afternoon: In this view, and the three below, we can focus the table on the 14:15 dispatch interval by selecting in the chart. The key point here is that the output profile through the afternoon was particularly choppy, suggesting fast-moving cloud cover that: 1) Particularly affected solar output at times; 2) But was difficult to accurately forecast … in this case by the self-forecast that was in place at the time. New England Solar Farm 2 (NEWENSF2) Second largest individual under-performance for this dispatch interval was for New England Solar Farm 2, as seen here: In the case of the NEWENSF2, unit output had been reasonably full through the morning (albeit choppy), but fell away unexpectedly entirely from the 14:15 dispatch interval. No self-forecast was in use here, so it was the AEMO’s ASEFS forecast that did not keep up. New England Solar Farm 1 (NEWENSF1) Given that this was due to weather changes, it’s no surprise that the sibling NEWENSF1 also saw the same issues: Darlington Point Solar Farm (DARLSF1) Darlington Point Solar Farm is located at the other end of NSW compared to New England, and the picture looks a bit different here: In this case the situation seems to a different cause: 1) First and foremost, the unit appears to have suffered from some technical limitation onsite all day: (a) Such as from inverters out of service … but which ASEFS did not know about (b) Such that ASEFS availability forecasts are seen (via the consistent pattern of dotted grey lines) to be overstating availability by 25MW-30MW each dispatch interval (c) Which will have probably worked its way through to higher Regulation FCAS costs for the unit as a result. 2) On top of this, there appears to have been a bit of cloud activity that has exacerbated the deviation for the 14:15 dispatch interval. Remember that these four units contributed about half of the collective under-performance … but that each of the (143) other units also has a story that could be told with the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view . But not today …",

    "content": "In between times these past couple weeks, we* have been trying to find spare hours to complete the focused analysis for 2024 Q1 for the latest iteration of our GenInsights Quarterly Update series . >> * These analytical reports are a collaborative effort between us here at Global-Roam Pty ltd (publishers of WattClarity ) and the team at Greenview Strategic Consulting . I’m currently working through the trended quarterly statistics for ‘ Aggregate Raw Off-Target ’ for all Semi-Scheduled units as part of a longer-term series of analysis – some of which we’ve shared under the ‘Trend of AggROT (across Semi-Scheduled units) ’ series of articles . Through 2024 Q1 there were a number of interesting days: 1) Even before the quarter had ended, we’d published ‘Aggregate Dispatch Error across all Semi-Scheduled units (NEM-wide) throughout Tuesday 13th February 2024’ 2) In this article we take a quick top-down look at Thursday 22nd February 2024 . 3) There were others, as well … Remembering back to Thursday 22nd February 2024. Over the day and since we have published a number of articles about that day by a range of analysts – where we have remembered to do so, these articles are all collated here . Some key points about this day: 1) It was a hot summer day, particularly in the southern regions 2) This heat drove ‘ Underlying Demand ’ to a new all-time record … for the NEM, and for Victoria. 3) Bushfires in VIC and TAS affected a range of electricity infrastructure, including: (a) some particular power stations, like Stockyard Hill Wind Farm and Waubra Wind Farm; but also (b) rooftop PV yield, and the predictability of that; along with (c) some transmission capability. With those articles setting the scene more broadly, let’s look particularly at this metric for Semi-Scheduled units. Aggregate Dispatch Error, across the Day Remember that Aggregate Dispatch Error is a step towards calculating Aggregate Raw Off-Target for any group of units, but is not quite the same. It’s just easier for me to pull the data out to present the following analysis. Here’s a graphical representation of calculated Aggregate Dispatch Error across all Semi-Scheduled units that were registered at that time: Remember that: 1) To click on the image for a larger view; and 2) That in terms of the number sign: (a) Positive numbers represent collective under- performance across the collection of units against their Targets, whilst (b) Negative numbers represent collective over- performance across the collection of units. Some quick observations 1) The numbers line up into essentially three time periods : (a) From midnight through until the sun comes up, the numbers are all relatively small, and mostly positive (b) Through sunshine hours the numbers on this day are almost always positive, are larger, and with some very large incidents . (c) From sunset the scale of the numbers drop off, and we see from ~22:00 in particular they are mostly negative. 2) In terms of large instances, we’ve chosen to highlight the 4 instances where Aggregate Dispatch Error was greater than 500MW, as follows: (a) At 14:15 NEM time we calculate Aggregate Dispatch Error to be +653MW (i.e. collective under- performance) PS1 we have specifically drilled into this dispatch interval in the subsequent ‘Case Study of 14:15 on Thursday 22nd February 2024 (large collective under-performance across all Semi-Scheduled units)’ article. (b) At 15:00 we calculate Aggregate Dispatch Error to be +550MW (i.e. collective under- performance) (c) At 15:50 we calculate Aggregate Dispatch Error to be +547MW (i.e. collective under- performance) (d) At 17:05 we calculate Aggregate Dispatch Error to be +609MW (i.e. collective under- performance) 3) Incidentally, we see a brief period of volatility for VIC, TAS and SA for 15:50, 15:25 and 15:30: (a) During which period the price for one of more of those regions was well above $500/MWh; (b) Coincidentally, the Aggregate Dispatch Error during these dispatch intervals dropped … not sure if related or not? We’ll leave this here, for now, but possibly drill in further later …",

    "content": "This morning we wrote the ‘Saturday morning wrap of forecast LOR conditions in NSW’, which spoke about forecast LOR1 or LOR2 conditions existing at the time for a number of coming days: Saturday 18th May (i.e. today). Sunday 19th May . Monday 20th May . Tuesday 21st May . Wednesday 22nd May . As I write this follow on, these conditions persist (though, of course, the specifics underlying them continue to change). Extended outages at Eraring 2 and Vales Point 6 Two of the reasons* for the AEMO issuing the string of Market Notices overnight was changed outage intentions by Origin Energy (for Eraring Unit 2) and Delta Electricity (for Vales Point 6). * note that it’s quite likely there are other reasons as well, but I have not checked at this time. This we can see in the snapshot from the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view as at the 13:50 dispatch interval early on Saturday afternoon: I’ve highlighted both of these units. Eraring unit 2 now offline till Monday 27th May Remember that Eraring unit 2 attempted to return to service on Thursday afternoon 16th May but hit a snag and came back offline Thursday evening . 1) At the time when I’d written that article (snapshot Friday 17th May at 07:45 via the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view ) we had surmised that the unit might be out until Tuesday morning 21st May 2024 2) However using the MT PASA DUID Availability data now updated from tomorrow forwards, the expectation is that the unit won’t be back until Monday 27th May 2024 . Here’s a view of the past couple days of bidding for Eraring 2 in the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view: I’ve highlighted one particular rebid reason that speaks to ‘RTS delay due to oil fire – SL’ , which sounds (at least to me) to be a bit cryptic, and where the ‘SL … i.e. see log’ instruction would really come in handy: 1) Is this describing some problem with oil firing in the boiler during the startup process? 2) Or was this describing some problem with an oil fire in some other part of the plant? Vales Point 6 now offline till Thursday 23rd May In this case, remember that VP6 tripped offline yesterday afternoon (Fri 17th May at ~14:20): 1) In that article we used a snapshot (at 17:10 via the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view ) to speculate that the early expectation was that the unit would be back online by Monday morning 20th May. 2) However we see above now the expected return to service being sometime Thursday 23rd May 2024 Here’s a view of the past couple days of bidding for Vales Point 6 in the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view: There’s nothing really in the more recent rebid reasons to indicate what was the specific cause of the unit trip … but had speculated in the earlier article that it might be due to the PA Fan limitation. Perhaps the generator has decided, now that the unit has tripped (possibly for other reasons) to get in and fix the PA Fan whilst it is offline (note this is entirely my speculation )?",

Recent run of performance of Vales Point unit 6 Remember that this unit was not the Vales Point unit that tripped early on Wednesday morning 8th May , but rather it’s the unit that’s been struggling along with only partial availability for a number of days. We can see some of the details here in this snapshot from ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view : See many of the rebid reasons referencing ‘PA Fan Limitations’ : 1) my (quite aged) power station experience revolved around the descriptors of: (a) FD (Forced Draft), upstream of the boiler; and (b) ID (Induced Draft) fans, downstream of the boiler. 2) but I believe a PA Fan (Primary Air Fan) is similar in purpose to the FD Fan, just different in some details I’m not familiar with. … so a limitation in PA Fan ability would clearly limit the unit capacity. Whether this was the reason for the unit trip, or not, is unknown at this point. Has it changed the prognosis for Monday morning? We’d noted earlier that ‘AEMO ‘forecast LOR2’ for Monday morning 20th May 2024 currently growing tighter’ … I wondered whether the trip of VP6 had propagated into a discount on Available Generation capacity forecast for Monday morning: But, as highlighted in the zoomed-in ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget snapshot at 17:10 today (i.e. almost 3 hours after the trip) that that’s currently not the case.",

    "title": "Looking closer at curtailment across wind farms in NSW last Wednesday 8th May 2024",
    "date": "17-05-2024 03:12:00 PM",
    "content": "Last week saw another eventful couple of days in the NEM, with the NSW region hitting the Administered Price Cap on Wednesday evening, for the first time since the Energy Crisis of 2022 . In the week since then, we’ve fielded various questions about wind farm performance in New South Wales, and the effect of network constraints. Paul began to address this in this first analysis piece here , but this afternoon I wanted to share two visualisations below, which should provide a closer look into the geographic spread of wind conditions and unit availability, and some context about network topology. The first is from the Bureau of Meteorology. This Mean Sea-Level Pressure (MSLP) chart shows atmospheric pressure. In an MSLP chart, wind strength outside of the tropics is inversely proportional to the distance between isobars i.e. close together lines represent stronger winds. Mean-Sea Level Pressure Analysis for 6pm on Wednesday, 8th May 2024. Source: BOM Although not quite as bad as what we saw in the middle of April , the chart above shows high pressure systems over the Southern Ocean, blocking cold fronts from the Antarctic direction. This resulted in below-average wind speeds for much of the eastern half of New South Wales in the early evening on May 8th. The second chart below is one I’ve compiled using data from our NEMreview software and it shows the relative size of each wind farm (the scaling of each pie chart’s size), and the generation, curtailment and unavailability (coloured slices on each pie chart) for the 18:30 dispatch interval last Wednesday evening. Generation, Curtailment and Unavailability (all in MW) at each wind farm in the New South Wales region last Wednesday for the 18:30 dispatch interval. Source AEMO, NEMreview Here on WattClarity, I’ve recently written about curtailment and about our more-detailed methodology for distinguishing between network and economic curtailment. For convenience I will point out the following in relation to the colours in the pie charts in the image above: Green is Generation. I’m using that term for simplicity’s sake, but more astute readers should note in the image that I am specifically referring to each unit’s ‘target’ – which differs slightly from the actual metered output of generation. Red is Curtailment (of any kind). Given that the spot price in NSW was $14,100/MWh during this interval, there is a strong indication that this was all network curtailment. Grey is Unavailability. This is simply the remaining amount of a unit’s capacity (e.g. megawatts below capacity that weren’t generated due to insufficient wind conditions, etc.). You could calculate the Availability by summing together the green and red portions mentioned above. The visualisation shows that only a handful of wind farms in the region had availability above 50% at this specific point in time. More notably, there was a significant amount of curtailment occurring in and near the Southern Tablelands region. By firing up my copy of ez2view, I can take a closer look into the constraint equations impacting these wind farms. I specifically note the N::N_CTYS_2 transient stability limit constraint was impacting a number of wind farms – with Collector, Crookwell 2, Gullen Range, Biala, Rye Park and Boco Rock all appearing with high factors on the LHS in this constraint equation. Paul has already written a longer piece covering this constraint equation . There are almost guaranteed to be other factors at play (interconnector limits, other constraints, etc.) but that is all I have time for late on a Friday afternoon. As time permits we hope to follow this up with further examination.",

Several contributing factors Using ez2view and a mash-up for 4 different ‘ Forecast Convergence ’ windows, we see a few other factors: Remember that this widget allows one to ‘ look up a vertical ’ to see ‘that other dimension of time’ . Here’s a couple factors: 1) Note the timing of the forecast LOR2 (i.e. 06:00 to 07:30) in relation to sunrise at around ~06:44 for Monday 20th May 2024. So clearly a time of negligible solar production. 2) Yesterday afternoon we’d posted how ‘Low wind conditions to persist, NEM-wide, for at least another week’ … and we see in the ‘ Forecast Convergence ’ window above that it’s forecast to be particularly low in NSW on Monday morning 20th May 2024. 3) Now we also have the added factor of Eraring Unit 2 possibly being out until Tuesday morning 21st May 2024 . 4) And it’s quite likely that there will be network limitations as well. ‘The Level of Risk in the NEM is escalating’ Way back in 2017-18, when we were compiling what became the GRC2018 , we wrote (as Theme 2 ) that ‘the level of risk in the NEM is escalating’ . 1) In the 6 years since that time, I’ve not really seen much to suggest that the level of risk in the NEM has been declining … and today’s ‘forecast LOR2’ notice is just the latest in an ongoing series. 2) Now readers should remember that the purpose of these forecasts from the AEMO is to elicit a market response , so by the time we get to Monday morning I hope it’s all abated. 3) But … (a) the transition to a riskier environment is what we’ve been conscious of when posting this ‘Updated trend of ‘ENERGY’ bids in red, green and blue’ , where: i. the changing patterns of bids feeds into the more volatile pricing patterns and hence increased financial risk, in the first instance ii. though they might feed into supply-demand risk over the longer-term (e.g. by making it increasingly difficult to approve and fund replacement firming capacity ). (b) and it seemed to be one of the two main points that Bruce Mountain was making earlier this week (with the other being that energy transition forecasts are increasingly not matching reality).",

Compared with history? The last time we added to this series of articles of long-term wind production statistics was back in April 2024.

    "date": "16-05-2024 09:11:00 AM",
    "content": "Given that we’ve invested some time in cataloguing what’s public about the 3-year history of Callide C4 Catastrophe (and also covered the Callide C3 cooling tower issue , which seems now resolved) here’s a quick note about the article by Anthony Macdonald ‘Queensland in secret bid to buy stricken coal-fired power plant’ (as Chanticleer) in the AFR late on Wednesday 15th May: Leaving aside that I’m pretty sure I’ve read before about the bid by CS Energy to buy out the half of Callide C that they don’t own (so I’m not sure what is ‘secret’ about it), the article is well worth a read. It covers a couple aspects of the following: (A) The root cause of the original failure The article has some updates on the schedule for finalisation of ‘ the Brady Report ’, which we look forward to being able to release … albeit that others have recently reported about some emerging doubt over whether it will ever be publicly released. In the AFR Anthony writes: ‘… That report is greatly anticipated; Queensland Premier Steven Miles, under pressure to keep electricity generators online and prices down, last week said he was yet to see it and was “frustrated in the delay”.’ and ‘More information on Brady’s report – if not the report itself – is due to be released in the coming week , although those involved have heard such promises in the past.’ (B) The Administration (by Deloitte), and possible sale/recapitalisation There’s also some interesting additional context of the process currently underway with the Administrators (being Deloitte) … and the action taken in the Federal Court (docket number QUD541/2023) by Sev.En (who is part-owner of IG Power, the 50% owner of Callide C). (C) Operational Data In the AFR article there’s not much in the way of operational data, but we can quickly reference ez2view to provide these additional details: … for Callide C3 Remember that Callide C3 began returning to service on Monday 1st April 2024 , after an outage lasting 518 days following the collapse of the cooling tower (which also delayed the return to service of Callide C4 ). This unit’s now running at over 400MW, as expected. … for Callide C4 The sibling unit ( Callide C4 ) is still offline, but now closing in on the anticipated start of the return-to-service process (beginning Sunday 30th June 2024 … which is now only 45 days away). This is shown here in the ‘Generator Outages’ widget from ez2view at the 09:05 dispatch interval this morning: In this image I’ve highlighted both: 1) The final days of the long Forced Outage process for Callide C4; but also 2) Given it’s on the screen, I’ve highlighted that the (expected) imminent return to service for Eraring unit 2 ( one of the units offline and hence contributing to the extreme volatility triggering Administered Pricing in NSW starting Wednesday 8th May 2024 ). If the Callide C4 reaches its return to service milestone, that will make it an outage length of 1,132 days … which I have previously speculated might be ‘longest outage in the history of the NEM’ , but have not yet had time to confirm.",

David’s equivalent note on Twitter is here : A couple key points here: 1) Yesterday I had copied in Jess Hunt’s comments about Low Wind harvest in South Australia for a shorter period in the same week. 2) On 10th May I’d written about how wind farm performance in NSW on Tue 7th May and Wed 8th May : (a) Had been disappointing, in terms of the underlying wind resource; (b) and that this had been exacerbated by spillage of some of the limited resource available due to constraints. (c) and hence how that had been one factor in the volatility. I’ve highlighted on the snapshot from Facebook above the period of firming in David’s modelling for Wednesday evening 8th May that had contributed so much volatility and had triggered the Administered Pricing.

    "content": "The past 8 days have been another topical period in relation to the looming closure of Eraring power station . 1) For instance, I’ve already noted how ‘Bruce Mountain’s commentary about Eraring (and the Energy Transition) is worth a read’ earlier today. From my reading, Bruce was trying to make a point that this 2) Elsewhere, I’ve seen others talk about this period being one of challenging VRE yield, NEM-wide. In parallel with these inputs, another of our readers called up and reminded me that I’d written ‘So how much did Eraring Power Station supply, of the NSW electricity consumption, at peak demand time on Thursday 29th February 2024?’ back on 29th February 2024, utilising a NEMreview v7 trend.

    "title": "Bruce Mountain’s commentary about Eraring (and the Energy Transition) is worth a read",
    "date": "15-05-2024 10:42:00 AM",
    "content": "I’d not seen it, but one of our readers pointed out Bruce Mountain’s opinion piece ‘Eraring closure exposes the ugly side of our energy transition’ in the Australian this morning: Whilst I don’t agree with everything Bruce says, it’s worth reading as a useful contribution with respect to the looming closure of Eraring , but also more broadly with respect to the energy transition . The opinion piece ties in three things: (A) What happened on 8th May 2024 As noted in other articles here, on Wednesday 8th May 2024 the NSW region entered Administered Pricing after the Cumulative Price exceeded the Cumulative Price Threshold (and which ended this morning ). In his article, Bruce writes: ‘On Wednesday only one of NSW’s four coal generators was producing significantly less than it normally does. Eraring was at half throttle. Wind generation in NSW was quite normal, demand was not unusually high but solar was not producing – the price spikes occurred in the early morning and evening periods.’ Adding some clarification: 1) With respect to ‘only one of NSW’s four coal generators was producing significantly less than it normally does’ , my sense is that it’s worth highlighting that two of the four coal-fired stations were challenged , as we’d reviewed last Friday 10th May (a) Eraring had 2 of 4 units off, (b) whilst Vales Point had 1 unit off and the other unit challenged). … so neither could ramp up as much as they might have. 2) Also with respect to ‘Wind generation in NSW was quite normal’ , I guess what ‘quite normal’ is not specified – and is perhaps a bit subjective. From my perspective, I’ve also written that wind generation was on the low side , made even worse by significant network curtailment. Bruce also notes: ‘ But such is the tightness of the NSW market that even reasonably mild reductions in coal generation, combined with weak wind/solar generation, now induce much more expensive gas generation into the market and prices then rocket up.’ … which is a similar point to what we’ve made with this ‘Updated trend of ‘ENERGY’ bids in red, green and blue’ . (B) Looming closure of Eraring Bruce is not the only one to connect the dots between what happened over the past week in NSW and what might have happened in 15 months time, had the (two operational) Eraring units not been there. (C) Managing (and modelling) the Energy Transition Bruce’s thoughts with respect to the energy transition are of interest. He finishes with this: ‘… The energy transition is evidently much more difficult than first thought. Institutions with the standing needed to honestly tackle hard problems, rather than wishing them away with unrealistic modelling and predictions, are needed. Without such reform, we will have to expect yet more perverse outcomes.’ With respect to the comment ‘The energy transition is evidently much more difficult than first thought.’ it’s been apparent to us* for some time in compiling the series of analytical and statistical reports for WattClarity Deeper Insights the there are essentially two groups of people: 1) A (seemingly much smaller) group who would read this and say something like ‘well, it’s turning out about as difficult as I’ve always thought it would be , because I’ve tried to be realistic and avoid rose-coloured glasses’ . * this group includes us at Global-Roam Pty Ltd (publishers of WattClarity ) and the team at Greenview Strategic Consulting , with whom we collaborate on the annual statistical digest (latest GSD2023 ) and the GenInsights Quarterly Updates analytical report. 2) A (seemingly much larger) group: (a) some of who are perhaps starting to realise that this transition is turning out more difficult than they had earlier thought … (b) but many more who just keep insisting we need to ‘get on with it’ (or words to that effect), as if that would just magically make many of the hurdles disappear. Hence the disconnect Bruce writes about (earlier in the article) as follows: ‘While the AEMO is on record pointing out that progress is lagging behind its plan, the gap is now so large the AEMO’s plans stand accused of being far out of touch with reality. … The NSW government might be accused of failing to think critically …. Origin also has questions to answer. …’",

    "title": "Low wind harvest in South Australia",
    "date": "14-05-2024 09:43:00 AM",
    "content": "Whilst speaking about social media posts, yesterday I also noticed this update by Jess Hunt about low wind conditions currently in South Australia . Given we’re increasingly coming back to review these types of events (e.g. for GenInsights Quarterly Upda te for 2024 Q2 ) I thought it would be useful to record this here today. There’s a few interesting comments in the conversation under Jess’ post (and perhaps more to come), so thought it useful to highlight two: (A) Was there any curtailment of Wind? Tim Ryan asks was there any curtailment of wind in South Australia over this period. With quick reference to NEMreview v7 we can confirm that, at least in terms of those wind farms that are Semi-Scheduled , or operating with Semi-Scheduled requirements, there’s not been any noticeable curtailment of wind in the past few days in South Australia: Those with their own licence to the software can open their own copy of this trend here . I’ve highlighted on the chart three visible periods of curtailment earlier in the month. More broadly with respect to curtailment, worth reminding readers here that Dan Lee recently published ‘Keeping Up with the Curtailment Part 2: The what and the where’ to continue his series. (B) Flexibility required Also in the comments, Joel Gilmore notes this: ‘I think this is a great example of the value of flexible firming technologies. The corollary to me, though, is that we need to ditch inflexible. Going forward of course, all new resources will be at _least_ as flexible as gas – in the case of batteries or the demand side, even more so. (So we don’t need natural gas specifically – though, if transport and storage allows, it might be worth saving some emissions budget for this purpose.)’ With respect to this comment: B1) Do we, or do we not, need gas peakers? A note of caution, for those readers who might want to Joel’s note here that ‘we don’t need natural gas specifically ’ (given all the conniptions politically about the recent gas strategy) that Gilmore was co-author on this recent Simshauser/Gilmore Working Paper that (in my reading) highlights all five principles : Principle 1) We’re likely to need a sizeable amount of peaking capacity that can burn gas : (a) would be even better insurance if it was dual fuel, so could burn liquid fuels; (b) even better if it could burn things that had net lower emissions. Principle 2) On average , it won’t run that often : (a) Low annual gas demand; (b) And low aggregate emissions. Principle 3) But on critical occasions (e.g. during long Dunkelflaute events that exhaust other stored energy) would need to contribute a large amount of megawatts . Principle 4) Market (or other) arrangements need to be in place to ensure that the owners/operators of this type of peaking plant: (a) Ensure the plant is built; and also (b) Ensure the plant is properly maintained, and supplied with fuel, ready to go during these insurance events. Principle 5) This is going to cost money , and that money needs to be added into the cost of : Part of the challenge of managing the energy transition towards a VRE + Firming world (it seems to me) is reconciling oneself with all of the 5 principles above . B2) A real ‘Statement of Opportunities’? Back on 12th April 2022 we shared what we’d written sometime before as Observation 8/22 from GenInsights21– what is the purpose of the ESOO (Electricity Statement of Opportunities)? . In those comments, we wondered how different the ESOO would look if it was to really be a genuinely focused ‘Summary of Commercial Opportunity’ ? To my mind, such a document would separate out the two elements (i.e. VRE and Firming) and separately identify the opportunities for both. With respect to the requirement for firming capacity, that’s what we have been doing for many quarters now with the metric ‘ Aggregate Scheduled Target ’ (i.e. a representation of what NEMDE is actually saying is required for firming assets each dispatch interval): 1) This is analysed in considerable detail each quarter in GenInsights Quarterly Updates ; 2) With some snippets shared in WattClarity articles catalogued under ‘The Need for Firming Capacity’ … including, with respect to the requirement for flexibility, analysis about the ramp in AggSchedTarget over various timeframes.",

    "date": "14-05-2024 08:45:00 AM",
    "content": "A journalist had called up yesterday to ask questions about what had happened on Wednesday 8th May 2024 in NSW , and I had explained what we’ve already written about (with respect to the physical market) in prior articles on WattClarity … and also commented that, though I had not checked, I would have expected Later that day, I’d seen that a different journalist (Peter Hannam at the Guardian) had tweeted about the same thing: During the day on 8th May (i.e. before the Cumulative Price hit the CPT) I’d written ‘More considerations, about the possible extension of Eraring Power Station’ , and had included a trend from NEMreview v7 to show how the rumours of an extension to Eraring had coincided with, and probably contributed to, a drop in traded prices for baseload futures contracts in NSW. Given the above I thought I would repurpose that same query to produce this updated trend of spot and contract prices in NSW over the past couple months: Remember that this with a licence to the software can open their own copy of this query here. With respect to this chart, we can see a number of things: 1) The thick black line shows the trended end-of-day price for NSW 2024 Q2 baseload (i.e. the current quarter) … and in this we clearly see the price jumping up with each burst of spot price volatility … (a) Which is indicated in the time-weighted (i.e. ‘base load’) average price for each day in NSW in bars at the back (b) Particularly we see … i. smallish steps up following brief burst of volatility on Thursday 2nd May and Friday 3rd May evenings; ii. A much bigger jump following Tuesday 7th May and Wednesday 8th May (the day the CPT was reached); and iii. Even some movement upwards after that point (noting that Thursday 9th May saw a TW average spot price for the day of $249/MWh, despite Administered Pricing being in place … remember the price cap is now $600/MWh not $300/MWh) (c) This is understandable, given the direct linkage. 2) We also see that all the contracts pertaining to future quarter periods also increasing: (a) Not by the same amount as for 2024 Q2 – but these all quite similar in gradient for the future quarters; (b) That’s for 10 different contracts (i.e. 2024 Q3 through until 2026 Q4); (c) Which is another illustration that these types of hedge contracts trade (at least partly) on sentiment (or, stating another way, the volatility in May 2024 has reminded traders that volatility can happen , and led at least some to modify their view on what it might mean in future quarters). 3) So it’s not too much of a stretch to wonder how (and when) this might flow through to retail contract prices.

Today we have already delved further, with a series of articles: #1 = ‘Delving deeper, into coal generator performance in NSW on Tue 7th May and Wed 8th May’ #2 = ‘Delving deeper, into Wind Farm performance in NSW on Tue 7th May and Wed 8th May’ #3 = ‘Delving deeper, into battery (discharge) performance in NSW on Tue 7th May and Wed 8th May’ #4 … so in this article we’re going to take a similar approach, but look at gas-fired peakers instead. #5 … might get around to looking at hydro in more detail at some point (but not now) We’re still using the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view . (A) All gas units across NSW (4 stations) There are 4 gas-fired stations in NSW at this point – here’s the shorter time-range aggregate view: It’s easy to see in this trend that: 1) As the ‘peaker’ name suggests, capacity is bid to run during peak times (but not at other times) 2) This was the case on Monday evening (even without extreme volatility), and then Tuesday evening, Wednesday morning and Wednesday evening … and then similar on Thursday as well (under Administered Pricing). 3) For Wednesday evening we see that three things occurred: (a) More capacity was offered (b) Much of it was offered down at -$1,000/MWh at the RRN (although some was still above $10,000/MWh) (c) More of it was dispatched. (B) Unbundling, for each of the 4 x NSW gas-fired stations Let’s unbundle for each of the gas peakers, alphabetically… B1) Colongra Peaker For Snowy Hydro’s Colongra Peaker, we see very distinct bidding patterns to reflect the output profile: During the Wednesday evening volatility period, almost all of the capacity was dispatched for a period of time (and almost all of it was bid down at -$1,000/MWh). B2) Smithfield Peaker For the Iberdrola owned Smithfield peaker, it was bid down at -$1,000/MWh at the RRN during the three periods of extreme volatility, and also at other times: However this was only at partial capacity (when compared to the Maximum Capacity of the station). B3) Tallawarra Peaker There’s two units in the Tallawarra station (the way they are registered at the AEMO). This chart shows that Tallawarra A was not bid to dispatch on Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning … but was on Wednesday evening and then also Thursday evening (despite the Administered Pricing): Note that Tallawarra B did not run (was not bid available). B4) Uranquinty Peaker We earlier posted ‘A quick look at the ‘N::N_CTYS_2’ constraint equation, with respect to Wednesday 8th May 2024’ , in which we noted that there were the 4 units at Uranquinty that were ‘constrained down’ by this constraint: 1) along with wind farms. 2) Keep in mind that there were other constraint equations that were also bound (so it’s not only this one that was a factor!) We can see this during the volatility periods on Tuesday evening 7th May and Wednesday evening 8th May … though not so much on Wednesday morning: From a bidding point of view, the profile distinctively shifted across the 4 day period … even outside of peak demand periods, with more volume bid to run.",

    "title": "How severe thunderstorms impact energy infrastructure",
    "date": "10-05-2024 04:48:00 PM",
    "content": "Earlier this year destructive thunderstorms and winds equivalent to a category two cyclone lashed Victoria, bending towers and toppling trees and poles. So, how can thunderstorms damage energy infrastructure, and are these events getting worse? This event occurred during mid-February 2024, when a strong cold front generated severe thunderstorms and localised wind gusts of 130km/h after a prolonged period of extreme heat. The image below shows a squall line around 1,500km long causing lightning across four states in February. Image: Himawari-9 satellite image, lightning and radar on Tuesday, February 13 at 3pm AEDT. The destructive winds were caused by microbursts, which bent towers and toppled trees and poles in Vic, leaving thousands without power. [Image removed from AAP 2025-02-12] Microbursts are a localised column of sinking air (downdraft) within a thunderstorm and is usually less than 4km wide. The cold, heavy air within this downdraft descends rapidly to the surface and then spreads out in all directions as it hits the ground. The image below shows how wind gusts are produced in thunderstorms. Microbursts can be destructive and cause wind gusts above 100 km/h, which can be a risk for power infrastructure. The force applied to the structure is roughly proportional to the speed squared. Fierce wind gusts from thunderstorms can: Knock down trees, which can fall onto power lines Topple poles Knock out transmission towers. Microbursts typically occur during the warmer months of the year and, unfortunately, they can develop rapidly and last for only a short period of time, making them difficult to predict and warn communities about. Have these thunderstorm events become more severe in Victoria? The severe thunderstorm season across southern Australia occurs during the warmer months of the year, between November and April. While thunderstorms are more common across northern Australia, Qld, and NSW, they do occur frequently in the summer months. The map below shows the annual average lightning density in Vic between July 2014 and June 2023, with the most lightning occurring in the northeast high country each year. Image: Weatherzone’s Total Lightning Network Annual lightning density mean between July 2014 and June 2023. You can see in the map above that lightning is common to the north of Ballarat near Learmonth and Miners Rest, with the region seeing 37.7 pulses per year. The high country near Benalla and Whitfield recorded an average of 28.1 pulses, Thorpdale in Gippsland saw 24.5 pulses, and Melbourne only 8.2 pulses per year. Research has shown that the warming climate is increasing the risk of heatwaves and bushfires, which can impact energy infrastructure. Unfortunately, it is unknown how global warming will affect thunderstorms and their associated destructive winds. To research climate change’s impact on thunderstorms, we would need quality data that dates back well into history. Unfortunately, detecting lightning is a fairly new phenomena, so a solid climate base to compare data to is not currently existent. According to the University of Melbourne researchers and Watt Clarity, ‘The evidence we do have suggests continued climate change may potentially increase the risk of extreme winds from thunderstorms. This is partly due to more moist and unstable air, which are essential for thunderstorms to form . We think these conditions could occur more often with climate change, in part because warmer air can hold more moisture.’ Indeed, much of Australia had an unusually stormy summer 2023/24, with Melbourne, Canberra and Brisbane all seeing 5 to 6 extra storm days a season. The map below shows that an unusually high number of thunder days were seen over most of Qld, NSW, SA, Vic, the ACT and Tas during the summer of 2023/24 compared to the average of the most recent nine years.

    "content": "Yesterday we posted ‘A first quick look at bids for NSW participants, including Wednesday 8th May 2024’ – including (amongst other things) an aggregate level view of Wind Farm bidding in NSW, looking back 30 days. In this article we’re going to narrow the date range (i.e. back 4 days from 04:00 this morning, Friday 10th May 2024) – so both: 1) extending more than 24 hours into the ‘NSW under Administered Pricing’ regime, 2) but also spanning the volatile periods of Tue 7th May evening, Wed 8th May morning, and Wed 8th May evening. We’re still using the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view . (A) All Wind Farms across NSW (17 stations) If I have counted correctly, there are 17 x Wind Farm (stations) in NSW via this filter currently – here’s the shorter time-range aggregate view: When we’d looked back over 30 days , the suspicion had been that the volatility in the market had been boosted as a result of wind capacity that was ‘constrained down’ during the volatile periods. In this narrower time-frame view, it’s clear that: 1) The total volume of wind harvest possible was 1,600-1,900MW lower than the theoretical maximum capability of the installed capacity base, due to lower-than-ideal wind conditions; 2) But on top of this , there was latent wind generation capability that was ‘spilled’ … presumably because of transmission constraints (i.e. all bids are in the blue range, so – especially during the clear periods of volatility – none would be ‘out of the money’). So there’s clearly two different factors at work. (B) Unbundling, for each of the NSW Wind Farms There’s too many for me to illustrate individually, so I have manually sorted and think B1) Wind Farm units that were ‘constrained down’ We earlier posted ‘A quick look at the ‘N::N_CTYS_2’ constraint equation, with respect to Wednesday 8th May 2024’ , in which we noted that there were a number of NSW-based Wind Farms that were ‘constrained down’ by this constraint … but keep in mind that there were other constraint equations that were also bound (so it’s not only this one that was a factor !) How much energy was spilled as a result (of this, and other, constraints)? Using the the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view , but filtering to just the sub-set of Wind Farms in NSW that were seen (in my quick scan) to be constrained by any constraint equation through this 4-day window, we see the following: Note that there are 10 x Wind Farms that have been added to this filter (Bango 1 & 2, Boco Rock, Collector, Crookwell 2, Crowlands, Gullen Range + Biala, Gunning, Rye Park) based on a quick scan – so not 100% fool proof. So what can we note here: 1) In each of the 3 periods of volatility there’s a substantial volume of energy ‘constrained down’ 2) Through each of these 3 periods, the aggregate dispatch gets worse as the period of volatility continues (presumably because the constraints bind more severely) 3) From ~18:10 on Wednesday 8th May, the constraints are severe enough such that only 20-30MW is allowed of production 4) At this low level, it means that by 19:55 there’s over 500MW of wind farm energy being spilled. So not insignificant at all, given it was all priced at $0/MWh or below… B2) Wind Farm units that were not ‘constrained down’ Without adding in much in the way of commentary, here’s the other 8 x Wind Farm stations… #1 Bodongora Wind Farm This snapshot shows that the UIGF dropped for the volatility on Tuesday 7th May evening, and particularly for Wednesday 8th May evening … but was reasonable for Wednesday 8th May morning. Why the PASA Avail dropped for almost a full day is a curiosity that has not been explored. #2 Crudine Ridge Wind Farm With this wind farm we see the UIGF dropped for Wednesday 8th May evening: Outside of the volatile periods, for some periods of time the bid price was dropped to –$1,000/MWh for reasons not explored. #3 Flyers Creek Wind Farm With this wind farm we see the UIGF dropped particularly low for Wednesday 8th May evening: For this Wind Farm the PASA Avail jumped up and down through the 4 day period, for reasons that have not been explored. #4 Sapphire Wind Farm With this wind farm we see the UIGF dropped particularly low for the start of the volatile period Wednesday 8th May afternoon, but ramped up somewhat over the next couple of hours: However that there’s also a period during Wednesday evening’s volatile period where the unit was unable to output to the levels prescribed in its target. That’s what the dotted grey lines in the chart show (note that this is much more severe in the case of White Rock … below). #5 Silverton Ridge Wind Farm This wind farm is the one that shows the best output profile (in the bunch here) with respect to the periods of volatility over Tuesday 7th and Wednesday 8th May: Whilst output was initially low when the volatility started on Wednesday 8th May, it did ramp up significantly by the end. Separately, there’s a sudden drop to 0MW at about 16:25 that is unexplored at this point?! #6 Taralga Wind Farm In contrast to Silverton (above), we see output from this Wind Farm ramped down through the period of volatility on Wednesday evening 8th May 2024 (after starting below 50% instantaneous capacity factor in the first place): Not sure why the bid changed to be –$1,000/MWh from around the middle of the day on Thursday 9th May? #7 Woodlawn Wind Farm With this wind farm, output during the period of volatility on Wednesday evening 8th May 2024 starts around 50% instantaneous capacity factor and drops slightly: #8 White Rock Wind Farm With this wind farm, output during the period of volatility on Wednesday evening 8th May 2024 starts low and rises … but seems to be suppressed lower by some form of plant limitation that’s not been explored? However it’s also worth noting that (over the 4 days shown) there are an enormous number of dispatch intervals in which the unit was unable to output to the levels prescribed in its target: 1) That’s what the dotted grey lines in the chart show. 2) This may well have had significant Causer Pays (Regulation) FCAS cost impacts? Reasons for this have not been explored.",

(B) Unbundling, for each of the 4 x NSW coal stations Let’s unbundle for each of the coal stations, alphabetically… B1) Bayswater Remember that this station had all 4 units running through the period: Underneath, I’ve shown the ‘Bid Table’, and tried to scroll to show rebids relevant to Wednesday evening … though there are too many to show in this image. Note the rebid reasons referencing commercial considerations (note to readers – ‘making money’ is not against the rules). B2) Eraring Remember that this station had all 2 units offline for unplanned outages during this period ( ER03 returned last night , whilst ER02 is still offline as I type this): In this case, of the two units that were operational, all bids were below $300/MWh during the volatile periods (partially higher outside of them). B3) Mt Piper This station had both units operational: This station had (more noticeably than for Bayswater) reduced aggregate capacity available on several occasions outside the volatile periods – but during the volatile periods all capacity was available, though some of it was priced > $10,000/MWh. B4) Vales Point Remember that this station had lost the VP5 unit in the early hours of Wednesday morning 8th May 2024: The outage of the unit is clearly seen here, as is the low load capability of the sibling VP6 unit. There are obviously more questions that arise from the above (perhaps different questions for different readers), but we’ll leave it there for now…",

    "date": "10-05-2024 11:52:00 AM",
    "content": "Can’t shake the curiosity about what happened on Wednesday 8th May 2024 , so am going to keep exploring in spurts. Apologies that this short article will be a bit cryptic at this point, for some readers (hopefully clearer later with subsequent articles being posted) – (A) Binding of the ‘N::N_CTYS_2’ constraint equation (amongst others) There were a number of constraint equations bound over the >4 hours of volatility experienced on Wednesday afternoon/evening … so readers should not mistakenly read that it was just this one that was material. A1) The Constraint Dashboard widget For several reasons I want to post this snapshot of the ‘N::N_CTYS_2’ constraint equation , time-travelled back to 04:00 this morning Friday 10th May 2024 … so: 1) extending more than 24 hours into the ‘NSW under Administered Pricing’ regime, 2) but also spanning the volatile periods of Tue 7th May evening, Wed 8th May morning, and Wed 8th May evening. For those who are not licensed to ez2view and so not familiar with this widget it is quite busy, but also quite powerful. Whilst the time-travel point (setting the context for the whole window) is 04:00 this morning, I’ve specifically selected the 17:05 dispatch interval on Wed 8th May in the chart to set the context of the table on the right: Click on the image to open in larger resolution on second tab With respect to this image: 1) All the DUIDs shown are located in NSW … we can see this with reference to the sky-high RRP for the 17:05 dispatch internal for each DUID. 2) Because of the different LHS factors (and possible presence of other constraint equations), the CPD Price is different for each DUID: (a) For a generator, they need to be bid at or below the CPD Price in order to dispatch … we can see where they are bid in the ‘Next MW @’ and ‘Last MW @’ columns, and the shading shows how much of that bid band was dispatched. (b) For a scheduled load, the logic is just reversed. 3) In particular I have highlighted a number of units that were all being ‘constrained down’ by this constraint equation and possibly other constraint equations as well (we’d need to look at the ‘Unit Dashboard’ for each individual DUID to see if other constraints were binding at the time) . (a) There’s a number of wind farms ‘constrained down’ by this (and possibly other constraints) – including COLWF01, GULLRWF1, GULLRWF2, etc… (reading from the top) (b) But important to note that Origin Energy’s Uranquinty gas-fired peaker is also being constrained down (just in this dispatch interval there’s ~241MW that could not be dispatched) 4) There’s other units shown with spare capacity (i.e. where pink colour shows when Availability > Target), but these are not being ‘constrained down’ by this constraint in this dispatch interval: (a) Some units (UPPTUMUT and GUTHEGA) appear to be limited by ramp rate or other limitations ; (b) Some units (TUMUT3, DPNTBG1, RIVNBG2) are bid well above their CPD Price so are ‘out of the money’ on their bid . 5) All of it adds up to available capacity that was not dispatched , though… A2) Constraint Description We saw the ‘N::N_CTYS_2’ constraint equation mentioned with respect to the ‘ ~80 minute run on spot price volatility in NSW on Tuesday 7th May 2024 ’ . Further articles might be tagged here in future. From the AEMO, and accessible in ez2view, the AEMO provides this information about this Constraint Equation: Constraint description: Out = Collector-Yass (3L), stability limit (Snowy-NSW) for loss of Yass-Marulan (5) or Crookwell to Bannaby (61) 330kV line Impact: NSW Generation + Interconnectors Source: Transgrid Limit type: Transient Stability Reason: Loss of Yass-Marulan (5) 330kV or Crookwell to Bannaby (61) 330kV line Modifications: Includes Crookwell 3 and HEZ1, amended SPD for Riverina 1 Bess Additional Notes: Refer to OM521/527 for limits advice. CCR7979 Might help some readers… (B) What’s up around Wagga? At this point, it’s useful to remind readers that Allan O’Neil has previously written ‘What’s happening around Wagga?’ to explain about this type of effect: Note that the particular constraint equation noted in this article (the ‘N::N_CTYS_2’ constraint equation) is not listed in Allan’s article … but the article talks about similar (not identical) types of effects .",

    "title": "A first quick look at bids for NSW participants, including Wednesday 8th May 2024",
    "date": "09-05-2024 01:14:00 PM",
    "content": "Well, curiosity got the better of me* – both in relation to internally-generated questions and the ones we’re receiving from various external sources, so I’ve referred back to my copy of ez2view v9.9.1.98 (which is soon to be superseded) and filtered down to offers from all NSW-based units as follows. * and we had other reasons to take a look at ‘ Bids & Offers ’ given what we’ve been doing at the back-end for the changed bid structures related to IESS Note that this is intended to be a quick helicopter-level view that starts the process to explore answers to some of the questions I asked at the end of the day yesterday . I’m expecting this to only partially answer questions … and indeed to open up for more questions we might explore further in the coming days… (A) All suppliers, looking back 30 days With this helicopter-level view, a key intent is to provide some perspective on Tuesday 7th and Wednesday 8th May in the context of other recent days, so readers might be able to quickly zero in on ‘what’s different?’ . For that reason we’ve taken the option of showing the most recent 30 days of bids for all units in NSW, with NSW spot price for ENERGY overlaid for context in terms of when the various periods of volatility occurred: 1) Briefly on Thursday 2nd May ; 2) Briefly on Friday 3rd May ; 3) On Tuesday evening 7th May ; and then 4) Both morning and evening Wednesday 8th May , and with prices elevated as well in middle-of-the-day. So let’s start by looking at all units: Remember that (for the IESS upgrade ) we’ve already changed the representation of bids so that bids above the line are for injections, and bids below the axis are for withdrawals from the grid (i.e. charging, pumping, or just general consumption for any Scheduled Loads). Also remember to click on an image to open in a larger size in another tab. This chart is understandably busy … but, if you squint, you’ll be able to see that Wednesday 8th May saw lower aggregate supply in NSW from all sources, at any price, than on some of the other days in the 30-day historical range. Meaning that (assuming import capability from QLD and VIC were the same, and demand was similar) the supply-demand balance would be tighter. (B) Filtering down to different types … looking back 30 days But we need to filter down further to see things in more detail – in this article we’re only going so far as Fuel Type aggregates – meaning that in some subsequent article we might drill into particular units. Given that the emerging operating philosophy is VRE + Firming, we’ll classify on that basis: B1) VRE … Variable Renewable Energy Leaving aside the invisible rooftop PV, let’s focus on what’s visible in terms of Semi-Scheduled capacity: B1a) Large Solar Here’s the last 30 days of offers from all Large Solar generators in NSW: Briefly about this chart: 1) There’s the gradual seasonal decay of capability as we head towards winter; 2) Clearly Saturday 4th May was the worst day for capability in this date range; 3) Wednesday 8th May was worse than Tuesday 7th May … which in turn was worse than Monday 6th May. 4) With volatility clearly occurring at sunrise and sunset periods . B1b) Wind Here’s the last 30 days of offers from all Wind generators in NSW: With respect to this 30-day span: 1) What others termed the ‘worst week for wind’ (earlier in April 2024) is clearly visible. 2) Prior to the morning of Tuesday 7th May, wind availability had been fairly strong (over 50% of installed capacity). 3) But this dropped lower through the latter half of Tuesday 7th and through Wednesday 8th May such that ~2,000MW of installed capacity was unavailable . 4) Curiously, it looks like ~300MW of available wind could not be dispatched during the time of peak volatility on Wednesday 8th May for reasons not confirmed at this point (but suspected to be transmission constraints ) B2) Firming … of various types Let’s start with the old and finish with the new… B2a) Coal Here’s the last 30 days of offers from all Coal generators in NSW: With respect to this trend: 1) There’s clearly less capacity available from coal on Wednesday 8th May 2024 than in the preceding couple of weeks (a) We have already written that Vales Point 5 had come offline Wednesday morning , and also that there were two Eraring units off on unplanned outages . (b) but is there more to this picture 2) Through the 30-day period there’s also a general decline : (a) perhaps in part because of planned outages (b) but clearly more to explore?! B2b) Gas Here’s the last 30 days of offers from all Gas generators in NSW: On this image note: 1) A period in the evening of Monday 15th April that saw more gas capacity available in NSW than any other period (this was during the wind lull ). 2) Apart from that, Wednesday 8th May stands out as the most volume from gas-fired generators offered – and in this case over more hours, as well. B2c) Hydro Here’s the last 30 days of offers from all Hydro generators in NSW (noting bids under the axis are bids to charge): With these hydro units, we see more volume offered progressively through the 30 day period, with Wednesday 8th May being a large day for discharge. There’s more to be explored here , though … B2d) Batteries Here’s the last 30 days of offers from all Battery units in NSW (noting bids under the axis are bids to charge): There’s obviously more to be explored with the way the batteries ran … there’s some indication that they might have run dry before the end of the volatility period on Wednesday evening 8th May 2024. B2e) Negawatts Here’s the last 30 days of offers from all Negawatt units in NSW: Not sure I need to say more about the lacklustre contribution? That’s all for now…",

    "date": "08-05-2024 09:33:00 PM",
    "content": "As expected earlier this evening , the NSW region has commenced Administered Pricing for ENERGY and all 10 x FCAS commodities this evening. The AEMO notified the market of this at 19:45:15 via Market Notice 116550 as follows: ‘——————————————————————- MARKET NOTICE ——————————————————————- From : AEMO To : NEMITWEB1 Creation Date : 08/05/2024 19:45:15 ——————————————————————- Notice ID : 116550 Notice Type ID : ADMINISTERED PRICE CAP Notice Type Description : Administered price periods declared. Issue Date : 08/05/2024 External Reference : [EventId:197] AP STARTED for ENERGY in NSW1 at 08 May 2024 19:45 ——————————————————————- Reason : AEMO ELECTRICITY MARKET NOTICE Issued by Australian Energy Market Operator Ltd at 1945 hrs on 08 May 2024 ADMINISTERED PRICE PERIOD DECLARED in NSW1 region. AEMO has determined that the rolling sum of the uncapped spot prices for the NSW1 region over the previous 2016 trading intervals has exceeded the cumulative price threshold (CPT) of $1,490,200.00. In accordance with Clause 3.14.2(b) of the National Electricity Rules, AEMO has determined that an administered price period will commence at the trading interval starting 1955 hrs on 08 May 2024 and will continue through to the end of that trading day* . An administered price cap (APC) of 600 $/MWh will apply to all trading intervals during this administered price period. This APC will apply to spot prices and to all market ancillary service prices in the NSW1 region. An administered floor price (AFP) of -600 $/MWh will apply to spot prices. AEMO will continue to monitor the rolling sum of the uncapped spot prices and issue further Market Notices as required. This is an AEMO autogenerated Market Notice. ——————————————————————- END OF REPORT ——————————————————————-’ The AEMO note talks about ‘through to the end of the trading day’, which is the way the AEMO’s processes work … however the way the Cumulative Price is calculated, it’s highly unlikely to roll off until sometime during next Tuesday 14th May 2024 (at least!). So expect a series of Market Notices at 04:05 each day for the next 5+ days, extending Administered Pricing (AP) for another day. Here’s a snapshot of NEMwatch at 20:55 this evening: A long run of volatility This followed a period this evening of almost uninterrupted spot price volatility in excess of $1,000/MWh (indeed, mostly above $10,000/MWh) commencing 15:40 this afternoon ( NEM Time ) and running through until 19:50 (i.e. the dispatch interval after which AP commenced). That’s more than 4 hours of sustained volatility! Second time ever, in NSW? I don’t have time to check comprehensively, but I believe that this is only the second time (in 25 years!) that Administered Pricing for ENERGY has been used in NSW … with the only other time commencing on 13th June 2022 as part of the Energy Crisis . The list of questions begins Much and all as this is an interesting turn of events, (fortunately or unfortunately) we have other things we need to be focusing on, so the (growing) list of questions about what’s happened and why has already started to mount up … including the following: Q1) What role did electricity demand play? In the NEMwatch snapshots the last few days, the level of ‘ Market Demand ’ in NSW has barely registered above the green zone … i.e. has been pretty modest. Is there more to it than that? Q2) What’s going on with the networks? Ability to import from QLD (to the north) and VIC (to the south) has both been severely limited – with network outages playing some role (and negative residue management in the mix in some directions). We’ll look to focus in more detail Q3) Technical limitations on supply-side assets? We’ve noted before that there’s been limitations on a range of supply-side assets in NSW, but a bit of time (and ‘next day public’ data) will give us the ability to delve further … but please don’t read this as a promise we’ll do this tomorrow! Amongst the questions: Q3a) What about VRE? We noted in several articles that VRE harvest was low through the past couple days – low solar (due to season, and also due to weather), and also low wind. But more detail needs to be added to understand just how poor. Q3b) Coal units offline We noted this morning that Vales Point 5 had come offline this morning in an outage not planned in advance , and also that there were two Eraring units off on unplanned outages . Those 5 units being off clearly did not help. Q3c) Other firming capacity What happened with the other NSW-located firming capacity … the gas, the hydro and the batteries? Did the batteries run dry, and were there water concerns at the hydro? Q3d) Negawatts? Given our historical role in facilitating a different form of demand response (i.e. not via the WDRM ), and that we’ve written before that that whole rule change process was a disappointment, I’m curious to see the level of participation in the (very small volume of) WDRM registered in NSW. Q4) Commercial limitations on supply-side assets? Again, we look forward to walking through each type of asset in turn … for instance, of the coal units available, some did not seem to be running flat out (despite, or perhaps because of, the high prices). Q5) is there a mismatch between the LOR criteria and the Market Price outcomes? Through yesterday evening and again this evening the NSW ‘only’ reached ‘Actual LOR1 ’ levels … and yet high prices were sustained for a long period of time. Is there anything more to think through in that apparent mismatch? Might take us some days to get back to, and/or through, this list. In the meantime, please feel free to throw others into the ring, via comments below (or directly via email). Preferably don’t call, as we need to turn our focus elsewhere for a while…",

    "title": "More considerations, about the possible extension of Eraring Power Station",
    "date": "08-05-2024 07:11:00 PM",
    "content": "It would be no surprise to readers that, at the EUAA national conference last week, that Eraring was a topic of conversation. (A) The rumours … starting in the Guardian? The day before the conference (on Tue 30th April 2024) I’d noted how ‘The Guardian writes about possible extension to Eraring ‘for as long as four years’’ … so was not surprised (as I’d expected) to see it discussed over the following days. (B) Eraring currently in the market On Wednesday (morning 8th May 2024) when writing about ‘Sunrise volatility in NSW on Wednesday 8th May 2024’ , I had noted the following view in the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view : It’s taken me all day to finish this article (with plenty of distraction, including with the ongoing run of prices in NSW), and in the meantime Dan has noted some similar things here . This image has been annotated with reference to both: 1) The first article today about sunrise volatility in NSW , in which we noted about the VP5 unit trip; and also 2) The third article today about return to service expectations for Callide C4 amongst other things. With respect to the image above … B1) Three Eraring units experiencing unplanned outages recently However in this article I’d like to highlight the 4 rows for each of the Eraring units, showing that: 1) Only ER01 has performed with high availability for each day over the prior 2 weeks, whilst 2) From Thursday 25th April 2024 we see ER02 running at only partial availability before coming off line for ‘Unplanned maintenance outage’ into Thursday 2nd May 2024 … and which (in the image above) looks set to return soon. 3) We see ER03 coming off for an ‘Unplanned forced outage’ into Friday 3rd May 2024 , with return to service perhaps (i.e. being stale data) for Saturday 11th May 2024 4) ER04 is operational currently, but we see if was on an unplanned outage up until Wednesday 1st May. B2) One factor in recent volatility in NSW In other articles we’ve written about: 1) A short burst of volatility on Thursday evening 2nd May 2024 … when the EUAA national conference had closed for the day; and 2) Another short burst of volatility on Friday evening 3rd May 2024 ; 3) A longer burst of volatility yesterday evening, Tuesday 7th May 2024 ; and also 4) This morning’s burst of volatility – Wednesday 8th May 2024. 5) And plenty of volatility this evening as well . No doubt there were others, but one common factor across all of these periods of volatility was the unavailability of one or more units at Eraring ! So very topical in the light of rumours of possible extensions. (C) A refresher on Risk At this point, worth reminding readers of what we wrote here in 2019 … that Risk is a function of both Probability and Consequence (and that each are somewhat independent). It’s also important to note that each person’s perception of, and Appetite for, Risk can be different . Makes it difficult when looking for an entirely ‘rational’ explanation of someone’s response to risk … even if they are an Energy Minister! (D) Responses to the rumours As noted in this original article , there were a number of media reports at different locations that responded to the rumours. I’d just like to highlight three relevant pieces. (D1) With reference to the Grattan Report I’d previously noted that ‘The Grattan report ‘Keeping the lights on’ is worth a read’ . … following that article (including with some attendees at the EUAA national conference ) I’d been asked more specifically what I meant by the fact that it was ‘thought-provoking’, so will provide more details as time permits. Specifically with respect to coal closure, by my read the Grattan Report essentially noted two key things: D1a) Two eras In the report they write… ‘The way forward lies in recognising that two distinct eras lie ahead for Australia: the coal closure era, and the post-coal era. The challenges in each of these eras are different, and require different approaches.’ (p3/45) and paraphrasing (my sense of) what follows with respect to the coal closure era is that the need for Government involvement is high (i.e. don’t worry too much about Rule Changes specifically focused on coal, as they take too long and would be too dependent on the changing appetite for risk at the Government). ‘Given the time imperative, governments and industry should accept this as a period of muddling through ’ (p32/45) Their term ‘muddling through’ is used several times in the report. Accept it will be messy. D1b) Coordinate coal unit closures (by direct Govt intervention), as a form of insurance In the report they write… ‘Use direct mechanisms with coal generators to provide insurance against early or delayed closure that creates major risks of blackouts and price spikes, or uncertainty for renewables investors. These mechanisms should maintain momentum on emissions reductions and avoid shifting excessive risks from operators to governments and consumers, while being clear and transparent to the market.’ (p4/45) … and also ‘Ensuring the lights stay on requires getting timely entry of enough new capacity of the right type. Ideally, new assets (renewables, gas, and storage) need to be in place before old ones (coal) exit, so there is no gap in supply. But the current NEM design does not encourage entry before exit. And these new assets need to be able to efficiently connect to the grid in order to dispatch their energy. An added benefit of coordination is that it prevents an extended period of high wholesale prices, such as we saw in the late 2010s. The current market design makes such coordination difficult. ’ (p15/45) … and also ‘Some form of closure insurance seems likely and it might be a pragmatic, if blunt, solution. Whatever the model, it should avoid shifting excessive risk from operators to governments, and its operation should be transparent to the market. It should also avoid creating perverse incentives for coal-fired power station owners to bring their closure dates forward in order to get subsidies.’ (p35/45) (D2) Response from Delta Electricity Well, what Grattan has written (in terms of facilitating orderly exit of coal) might sound easy if one reads it quickly, however last week we saw an early example of why the reality is going to be more complicated … and why ‘muddling through’ is going to be the codeword for this ‘coal closure era’. Roughly 24 hours after rumours surfaced in the Guardian, another NSW-based coal fired generator (Delta Electricity) posted this response on social media : This response from Delta was reported by Colin Packham in the article ‘NSW-backed extension of Eraring is reward for Origin’s mismanagement, Delta Electricity says’ in the Australian on Wednesday afternoon 1st May. … and was probably noted elsewhere as well. Same sorts of responses to that noted in March 2021 when news broke about the confidential ‘safety net’ provisions to keep Yallourn operating till mid-2028. (D3) Response from Matt Kean Amongst the many other responses to the Eraring extension rumours, I’d like to highlight one other piece – being the response ‘NSW’s bid to keep Eraring coal power station going a backwards step’ by former NSW Treasurer Matt Kean: For those who have access, the article is well worth the read. Amongst the other things Matt has written, he says this: ‘The independent advice I received as energy minister was that if we delivered the Waratah super battery, and several other projects, we could keep the lights on without slugging taxpayers for the cost of propping up Eraring. If the situation is different now, then the very least the Minns Government could do is come clean to NSW taxpayers about what has changed, rather than negotiating in secret with Origin Energy.’ Whilst I have some concerns (perhaps more than Matt) that everything will go smoothly if Eraring closes all 4 units as currently indicated in August 2025: 1) I do agree that it would be very much desirable that the advice on which any decision to extend is made should be made public (along with the method of support) 2) Though I am also doubtful that either will be released in the public domain. (E) Spooking the futures market? I’ve a recollection that someone at the EUAA national conference last week also mentioned that the futures market had marked down NSW Base Load contracts on the back of the rumours of an extension to Eraring … but can’t recall who that was. Out of curiosity I used NEMreview v7 to put the following trend together: Those with their own licence to the software can open their own copy of the query here. There certainly does seem to be a drop in all of the 8 x Base Load contracts I have selected that is coincident with the rumours being published at the Guardian, and hence circulated on WattClarity and elsewhere. However I wonder if this was the only trigger … as we see that Base Load contracts for 2025 Q1 and 2025 Q2 also dropped at the same time ? Given Eraring was always assumed to be available on those quarters, I don’t immediately understand why news of an extension to operation through 2025 Q3 and beyond that would have fed into the futures market (though never say never, as it does trade on sentiment, amongst other things!). (F) Watch this space More to come soon, it seems …",

    "content": "I was on the road last week (including for the EUAA National Conference, as noted here ) but noted more media articles in the Australian about the long-running saga of ‘the Brady Report’ following investigations into the technical causes of the Callide C4 Catastrophe . (A) Media articles about the Court Case Here’s a quick wrap… (A1) In the Australian On Friday 3rd May 2024, Nick Evans wrote ‘Court orders handover of documents related to 2021 explosion at Callide C power station’ in the Australian: … so at that time we expected to see the report released during May 2024 (the article contains other details worth reading, for those who have access). But yesterday (Tuesday 7th May) we saw Nick Evans and Angelica Snowden provide the update ‘State-owned CS Energy wants the federal court to keep Callide C explosion report secret’ in the Australian: So I guess we have to wait, to see what the Court rules? (A2) At the Federal Court Remember that there are a couple different matters related to Callide C4 in the Federal Court at present: QUD61/2024 … by Sev.En (part owner of part owner) In several articles we’ve highlighted updates on the Court Case referred to in Nick’s articles above … most recently on 29th January 2024 with ‘Federal Court rules about Callide C – independent investigation authorised’ . In this case the Federal Court website reference is here (docket number QUD541/2023) . QUD61/2024 … by the AER On 9th February 2024 we wrote ‘The matter of Callide C back in Federal Court (this time via AER)’ … and that the relevant reference Number appears to be QUD61/2024 . (A3) With the stakeholders With respect to the key stakeholders: (a) At CS Energy I could not see anything on the news section of the CS Energy website … nor did I see any updates here on the company profile LinkedIn . (b) At Sev.en Global Investments I also did not see anything under ‘Press Releases’ or ‘News Highlights’ on the 7GI website. (A4) Elsewhere? I’ve not looked specifically, but have not seen anything else. (B) 53 days till return to service? Whilst publishing this article, worth attaching the latest snapshot from the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view to highlight that there’s been no recent change in return-to-service expectations: Remember that this widget allows the user to ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to see ‘ that other dimension of time ’ We are still looking at: 1) Return to service at part load (i.e. 210MW) on Sunday 30th June 2024 2) Full service (i.e. back to 420MW) on 31st July 2024. Given that the turbine and generator (and associated plant) are all new, and that the boiler has been in deep storage for ~3 years (presumably nitrogen capped or something similar*) it will be with keen interest to see how smooth the return to service operations are. * for those unaware, this type of process was used at other times in the NEM, such as when some Tarong units were mothballed ~10 years ago.

    "title": "Early reflections on the concerns of large energy users, from the 2024 EUAA National Conference",
    "date": "08-05-2024 08:56:00 AM",
    "content": "Last week I was on the road a bit, in part for the National Conference of the Energy Users Association of Australi a (EUAA) in Melbourne: What follows is the start of some reflections from me about what I observed over the conference 1) The value of the event For us (i.e. at Global-Roam Pty Ltd ) we’ve been a keen supporter of the EUAA for ~20 years, because we see that the organisation does very useful things to advocate for the concerns of large energy users with respect to what’s been unfolding in the electricity and gas sectors in Australia. Because our client base includes a number energy users who are (and/or could be) EUAA members, we’ve found if very useful to participate in these events as a means of efficiently having many conversations with these clients and others at these events … and listening to the concerns raised by energy users and their representatives. 2) Cognitive dissonance in the energy transition During the event we heard the oft-repeated line that goes along the line of… ‘[the modelling suggests that] firmed renewables is the cheapest form of new energy …’ … but through the event (via presentations and direct conversations) we’ve continued to hear about the concerns of energy users that their cost of energy consumption is going up in the future, compared to what they had paid some 5 or 10 years ago. Whilst it’s generally acknowledged that energy costs of yesteryear (back in the ‘coal was king’ pre-transition days) excluded a price on carbon, the energy users are still trying to grapple with how to manage this increase in underlying costs. 3) The other ‘baseload’ challenge If you listened only to much of the discourse on social media with respect to the energy transition , you could be forgiven for assuming that ‘baseload’ is a term that was used exclusively for types of power generation technology that are (or were) relatively high capex and relatively low opex … and so because of economics, and then also because of technical design, are best suited to run continuously. … think ‘base load’ coal units in the NEM, and nuclear in other locations. But it always was the case that there are also ‘base load’ type of energy users that were (historically, at least) blessed with the same type of operating profile … and so were a good match for electricity system designers in days of yesteryear. … think aluminium smelters (or other large energy users) being built or expanded in lock-step with coal unit expansions These types of energy users (many of them EUAA members) have been struggling to source ‘whole service’ power purchase agreements that have felt a bit like ‘square peg in round hole’ with respect to the ‘VRE + firming’ philosophy for the new energy system. 3a) A glimmer of hope? Hence it was noticeable when one of the speakers (can’t remember who) called out the RenewEconomy article ‘Neoen sees more “baseload renewable” contracts as it rolls out five new big battery projects’ as providing some much-needed promise to their hopes of bring able to continue to play a role in the NEM: Of course, the devil is in the detail (e.g. is it really a ‘baseload’ offering, and at what price?) … but at least it was welcome news at the conference. 3b) What of baseload consumption in the CIS? We’ve written a number of articles previously about the Capacity Investment Scheme … and I’ve also highlighted my surprise/concern at seeing something originally focused on providing firming capacity being hijacked to now predominantly support VRE. It was notable that: 1) there were conversations at the EUAA National Conference about what value (from an electricity system design) large energy users deliver to the integrated energy system as a result of their large, stable and predictable consumption profiles … with the added benefits on top being the option for occasional flexibility such as we have been supporting for years . 2) this led to questions about whether these values might be supported in something like a (baseload consumption) Capacity Retention Scheme. More might come later, time permitting …",

    "title": "Regulation FCAS Costs in 2023",
    "date": "03-05-2024 03:59:00 PM",
    "content": "As Dan had noted in his part 2 article on curtailment Keeping Up with the Curtailment Part 2: The what and the where he and I were delighted to deliver a presentation to an audience arranged by the Clean Energy Council . I would like to reiterate Dan’s thank you to Christiaan Zuur and Ana Spataru from the CEC for the invitation. As part of the presentation we looked into FCAS costs, specifically Regulation FCAS costs for wind and solar units in the NEM. I’ll elaborate a little further on that in this article. Regulation FCAS costs for wind and solar units in the NEM Regulation FCAS costs cover the expense to correct the frequency when in deviates in response to an imbalance between supply and demand. Check out the WattClarity article Lets Talk About FCAS for more information. The costs are assigned to generating units but the main differential between high and low costs is that it depends on whether the unit follows its dispatch instruction and, where it doesn’t, it may be deemed as contributing to poor grid frequency in the interval, and if so, will attract a portion of the cost of regulating the grid frequency in that dispatch interval. As costs relate to how the unit follows its dispatch instruction, generators whose output is variable (solar and wind sources) often attract higher costs, especially when that variability is greatest. *note that under the current cost calculation methodology units grouped together by participant portfolio can see their overs and unders net out. This and more is covered in a separate WattClarity article here . The larger the unit, the greater the Regulation FCAS costs Drawing on data from the GSD2023 , to orient ourselves, the following chart presents annualised FCAS costs relative to each unit’s max capacity in 2023. Two general observations stand out: The larger the unit, the greater the Regulation FCAS costs Costs for individual units of similar size vary by fuel type (as the colours show a degree of separation) yet also by other drivers not captured in the chart. In the next chart we plot the units Regulation cost as a percentage of energy market revenue. The data is, again, for 2023 and shows that there is a general tendency for units to see Regulation costs around 2.5% of energy market revenue. Nonetheless, the percentage for some units – and these were predominately solar units – in 2023 was far higher that 5% of energy market revenue. Of note: the percentage tends to stay steady regardless of max capacity and this is to be anticipated as the unit’s capacity plays a dominant role in its energy market revenue and therefore it is already accounted-for in the percentage. Other ways to offset Regulation FCAS costs? It may come as a surprise to some readers but the technology exists for wind and solar units to participate in the NEM’s FCAS markets. This provides an opportunity to earn revenue from FCAS provision. There aren’t many wind or solar units participating in FCAS markets yet, but for those that are, we can assess the revenue relative to Regulation FCAS costs. This analysis, and understanding how bids and enablements have contributed to a unit’s revenue in the ten markets, is supported by the new 10-year FCAS section of the GSD . In the next chart we plot the Regulation FCAS costs after subtracting FCAS market revenue in order to gauge whether this revenue stream helps to offset Regulation costs. What stands out is the single solar unit that earned FCAS Revenue (by being enabled and providing FCAS) in 2023 and saw that revenue more than offset its Regulation FCAS costs, putting its position below zero on the y-axis. Three wind units were also involved in FCAS markets but to a lesser degree and hence the revenue did not make as great an impact in the chart. Self-forecasting and Regulation costs The presentation also spent time uncovering recent trends in adoption of self-forecasting, a topic we here at WattClarity are taking an increasing interest in. For background on what is self-forecasting and how does it play a role in the market the WattClarity archive of articles collated under the Self-Forecasting topic may be of interest. For the CEC presentation, we visualised Regulation costs for 2023 and highlighted units participating (at least once in 2023) in self-forecasting: The chart above helps demonstrate how self-forecasting participation generally improves Regulation costs: Fewer solar units who engaged in self-forecasting appear to sit higher up in chart. Although, there were two outliers using self-forecasting with high Regulation costs. These didn’t use self-forecasting for all periods in the year, so the position may change as their the use of self-forecasting changes. A cluster of wind units using self-forecasting and having low Regulation costs is clear in the chart. As at of the end of 2023, there appears a tendency for larger wind units to not yet have adopted self-forecasting. That’s all for now. We look forward to the next opportunity to share insights on units operating in the NEM with CEC members",

This article shares some of these insights and is a more in-depth follow-on to an earlier article I posted in March about curtailment in the NEM. Curtailment, what’s that again? For our purpose as market analysts we say that curtailment in the NEM typically happens due to one of two factors: either due to network reasons or due to economic reasons. I will elaborate on those two types of curtailment further down, but to avoid repeating what’s already been written on WattClarity, I will point out two great articles that explain this concept in more depth, and which also provide some more detail about the calculation methodology we’ve employed – this one by Allan O’Neil and and this one by Marcelle Gannon . In this analysis we are looking at curtailment specifically for semi-scheduled solar and wind farms. As a quick reminder, the Semi-Scheduled category is a registration category that generally covers all solar and wind farms in the NEM greater than 30MW, although there are some exceptions. In this article, everything mentioned here relates to semi-scheduled solar and wind units only . There is generally no availability data in the public domain for non-scheduled and behind-the-meter solar and wind farms – so therefore we can’t analyse curtailment figures for those. The bigger picture view of curtailment In our GSD we publish curtailment figures for each individual semi-scheduled solar and wind unit. But by using the GSD data extract, and with a tiny bit of spreadsheet work, I have been able to aggregate all of these numbers together to gain a higher-level overview of curtailment across the NEM. In Part 1 , I posted a chart showing the combined view of production and curtailment for these solar and wind farms. For reference, that chart is shown again below: Source: GSD2023 Data Extract In green, you can see the volume-weighted capacity factor for all solar and wind. So in the chart we can see that combined generation was therefore lowest in April and May in 2023, owing to less favourable solar and wind conditions. In red is the network curtailment factor – that’s a metric that I believe we’ve coined. It’s a very similar metric to capacity factor, but instead of volume of energy generated being the numerator, it uses the volume of energy curtailed due to network constraints as the numerator. Expressing this as a factor is a useful way of showing relative curtailment at a unit level, or, at an aggregated level like shown here. And finally in orange, you can see the economic curtailment factor – which again, is a similar metric we’ve created, but the numerator being volume of energy economically curtailed. Note: As Allan has kindly pointed out in the comments below, it is important to note that the denominator in all of these factors is aggregate maximum capacity (in MWh). This differs to other metrics of curtailment from other sources that tend to use available energy as the denominator. In the next chart below, I’ve separated the data, and am now just showing these factors just for the wind component. Source: GSD2023 Data Extract Here, we can see relatively less network curtailment across the year compared to the last chart. Although wind generation was highest in winter (where the volume-weighted capacity factor even went above 40% in June), we can see that there was a proportionally small amount of curtailment of either kind during these months. We also see that there was a more material amount of economic curtailment in the back four months where economic curtailment ranged between 1.56% to 3.21% relative to total capacity between September to December. Given that we’ve recently come off of a widespread wind lull , it will be interesting to see this years numbers when we run our calculations again for the GSD2024 early next year. The next chart displays those factors but now for only solar farms. Source: GSD2023 Data Extract We can see the obvious seasonal shape of production through the year – with solar capacity factors dipping in those winter months with less daylight. There was also lower curtailment of either kind in those months. Here curtailment again peaked in the back four months of the year. In October alone we see that there was a combined total of 7.76% of curtailment, compared to a 22.44% capacity factor. So that means that there was a ratio of roughly 3:1 in terms of energy actually produced compared to what was lost to curtailment for that month. Network Curtailment Network curtailment occurs when a network constraint limits a unit’s output to levels lower than what was available to generate. For that reason, others have referred to this as ‘forced curtailment’ because it is imposed on the unit operator. Network constraints are a very tricky area of the market – one that we like to cover regularly on WattClarity , and that we attempt to help our clients navigate in real-time through our ez2view software. In the image below I’ve mapped individual network curtailment factors for each solar and wind unit across the NEM. The size of the icons on the map are scaled to their network curtailment factor. The transmission network is grey scaled with higher voltage capacity shown as darker lines. Network curtailment factors across the NEM in 2023. Whilst network curtailment was evident throughout the NEM, these two sub-sections of NSW and VIC were the worst hit areas. Source: GSD2023 Data Extract We can see that across the network, there was a measurable, albeit small, amount of network curtailment occurring in all regions, except perhaps Tasmania. But by far, there are two smaller sections of the network that were worst hit, and are highlighted in the map above: A section of central New South Wales on the 132kV line just west of Orange, And the 220kV section of North-West Victoria, at the top of the so called ‘Rhombus of Regret’. The top 5 ‘worst hit’ units were all solar farms, and were all located in these two sections. I covered some of those outcomes in Part 1 , and regular WattClarity readers would have seen a couple of those solar farm appear at the top of that list in previous years also. Network curtailment was very material in those most extreme cases – we see at Molong Solar Farm that there were more MWhs of energy being network curtailed than there were MWhs of energy being produced last year. Economic Curtailment Economic Curtailment is also referred to as ‘self-curtailment’ or ‘offloading’ as it’s a deliberate choice made by a generator to operate below their available generation at certain times – generally because the resulting spot price was below what they were willing to generate at (see: increasing negative prices ). You can think of this as a measure of how many MWhs were ‘priced out of the market’ because the price offered for those volumes was higher or at the spot price. There is some nuance that is important to understand about economic curtailment. Units submit bids before the dispatch process runs. And ultimately.. it is the dispatch process that determines constraint outcomes, and therefore network curtailment. The effect of this is that there will be some economic curtailment which might be hiding what would have otherwise been network curtailed, but not vice versa. As we can’t re-run the dispatch process for every interval with different bids, it’s therefore extremely difficult to say with certainty how much of this economic curtailment would have otherwise been network curtailed. On the map below we can see that economic curtailment was far more evenly spread across the NEM than what we saw in the previous map. Economic curtailment in 2023 was far more evenly spread out across the four mainland regions. Source: GSD2023 Data Extract We see solar in Queensland was hit particularly hard, and slightly less so in New South Wales. There was relatively little economic curtailment for wind farms in those two regions. In Victoria and South Australia we see that there was material economic curtailment for both solar and wind. The top 5 worst hit units in terms of economic curtailment were also solar farms, some of these were mentioned in Part 1. Using our ez2view software we can see that the bids for some of these solar farms have remained very static despite the curtailment – so we assume that long-term contract terms are dictating the pricing of some of the bids there. Key Takeaways I hope these charts and maps have shed a bit more light on what is happening with curtailment across the NEM. To conclude, below are two key points that I’d like to share based on this analysis. Solar farms continue to face economic and network challenges. We observe a seasonal amplification of these challenges. Curtailment for wind generation last year was slightly less severe, and largely confined to economic offloading in Victoria and South Australian throughout Spring. Curtailment is a function of supply and demand (and the network). In the session yesterday one audience member asked why solar curtailment was so much higher in Spring compared to Autumn. Whilst there is surely a longer answer to this question.. it’s important to understand that both network congestion and bid stack congestion relate to how supply and demand meet. We therefore need to consider the amount, profile and location of available generation against the amount, profile and location of demand (and the network in between). Or in other words.. the value of the underlying electricity.",

Our presentation leaned on statistics and analysis work we’ve included in our recent GSD2023 and GenInights Quarterly Update reports. We appreciated the invitation from the CEC to share some of these insights with a large and diverse audience. Our session today covered six topics, with a short blurb about each of these below: Network Curtailment – areas of the network where wind and solar are facing significant network constraints. Economic Curtailment – the extent and spread of wind and solar units affected by unfavourable prices. FCAS – regulation costs are considerable for some units. We explored differences across the wind and solar fleet. Self-Forecasting – adoption rates and patterns in self-forecasting. High Price Capture – how effective have wind, solar and battery units been at capturing prices > $10,000/MWh? Firming Capacity – dispatchable capacity continues to be required (and used) to cover low VRE periods, but how is the amount changing? In the coming days and weeks, both Linton and I hope to publish some snippets from the presentation here on WattClarity.",

    "content": "Given that we’ve taken an interest in what’s going to happen with the looming closure of Eraring Power Station (here) , I thought it would be useful to our readers to highlight Peter Hannam’s article in the Guardian ‘NSW to announce life extension of Eraring, Australia’s largest coal-fired power station’ published at 11:03 NEM Time : The article does say ‘exclusive’, and I’ve not seen anything else anywhere else on a quick scan … but there are threads already starting on social media – with many doubting that it would be required (though I am not so confident). The key points in the article appear to be: ‘The New South Wales government will announce within days it will extend the operations of Australia’s biggest coal-fired power station for as long as four years. The decision involves provide taxpayer subsidies to Origin Energy’s Eraring power station for two years with permits to run for two more, according to several people who have been briefed on the plans. The cost of the subsidies are due to be discussed by the Minns government’s expenditure review committee as soon as this Friday . Environmental groups and local MPs were also due to be briefed on the plans later this week and prior to 10 May . So perhaps we’ll have to wait till Friday 10th May (next week) to know something definitive? No doubt will gain a mention at the 2024 EUAA National Conference , which starts tomorrow in Melbourne.

    "title": "Updated trend of ‘ENERGY’ bids in red, green and blue",
    "date": "30-04-2024 08:29:00 AM",
    "content": "Last Tuesday 23rd April 2024 I spoke with an audience organised by BofA Securities with respect to ‘Risk, Uncertainty and Volatility in the energy transition’ . That presentation drew from a series of analytical and statistical reports – WattClarity® Deeper Insights – that we’ve been developing as a joint effort between our team at Global-Roam Pty Ltd , and the team at Greenview Strategic Consulting . These cover Analysis and Statistics: ANALYSIS = The GenInsights21 report, which has led into the GenInsights Quarterly Updates series; and also STATISTICS = The GSD2023 , now the 5th in this annual series of (unit-centric) Statistical Digest. Background With an investment-minded audience, it’s understandable that the interest was on price patterns (something we’ve done for a number of successive Q2 periods ) and volatility. 1) This pricing variability is driven by a number of factors, including increased uncertainty and risk. 2) Hence it was logical for the presentation to look at several aspects of variability and risk. A good illustration of one of the drivers to the increased price variability we’re seeing in the NEM these days, is our well used coloured stack of bids for ENERGY from all suppliers, NEM-wide, using three primary colours. Indeed, we’ve seen this before, on several occasions …. For more than 10 years … For many years, the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view used a ‘Default Price Bucket’ that utilises a bid buckets that use three primary colours. You’ll find many articles here on WattClarity utilising that widget … some of them tagged here . However it was not until our GRC2018 that we reviewed, and published, a review of bidding behaviour that was both: (a) long run (back to the start of the NEM); and also (b) NEM-wide … Trended bids, to 31st December 2018 In our GRC2018 we analysed data from 1st January 1999 to 31st December 2018. As Theme 2 within Part 2 of that report, we wrote about how the “The level of Risk in the NEM is escalating” . As part of illustration of that risk, we illustrated: 1) the declining percentage of energy volume bid in the traditional short-run marginal cost bid bands (i.e. above $0/MWh up to the $300/MWh ASX cap trigger price), which we coloured in green … 2) compared to both: (a) the blue bids ($0/MWh and below) and (b) the pink/red bids (above $300/MWh up to the Market Price Cap ). That particular representation of emerging risk: 1) Was c opied out into this ‘Longer-term trends of low (and high) dispatch prices…’ article on 30th August 2019 ; and 2) We referenced Theme 2 within the GRC2018 also with respect to pricing patterns for 2022 Q2 in this article on 6th July 2022 . That revelation in the GRC2018 resonated with a number of people, including journalists such as: 1) In RenewEconomy on 31st May 2019 (the day of release), Giles Parkinson wrote ‘Energy transition has only just begun, but solar has already changed the game’ and referenced this review of bids: ‘It notes also how the generators have responded to “manage risk” (some might say to game the market), with a change in bidding patterns. This is particularly seen in the amount of capacity that is now bid at the high end of the market, an observation shared by AEMO’s recent quarterly reports.’ 2) On the ABC on 31st May 2019, Stephen Letts wrote ‘ National Electricity Market lacks ‘holistic thinking’ and risks ‘failing to keep the lights on’ ’ , and referenced this representation of bidding behaviour as follows: ‘Supply is being more geographically dispersed, transmission stretched and pricing policies are not helping in designing the most efficient and reliable system. Changes in ‘bid patterns’ for power are seeing an increasing volatility and a concentration of either extremely low (below $0/MWh) or high (above $300/MWh) prices. Occasionally “cheap” power may sound good for consumers, but they are bids from price-takers who find it either cheaper to keep plants going, or are happy enough to take whatever price is going — but average prices across the curve keep creeping up.’ 3) Later in the AFR, as noted in this WattClarity article on 9th August 2019 . Updated trend of bids, to 31st December 2020 In January 2021, we wrote the article ‘Prior to the wider release of the GSD2020 … here’s a 10-year trend of bidding behaviour’ utilising the same bid band colours NEM-wide. Updated trend of bids, to 30th September 2021 In the follow-on analysis in our GenInsights21 report, we used a data cut-off as 30th September 2021 to allow us to complete the analysis before the end of the calendar year (and we only just made it ). 1) In the 2nd section of that ~500-page report, we updated the trend of bids across all units for the ENERGY commodity to that date: (a) Broken down into monthly volumes, to provide more detail than the annual stats in the same format chart in the earlier GRC2018; (b) We also included similar views for each of the 8 x FCAS commodities that existed at that time as well. 2) I’m not sure we copied that into any WattClarity articles … however following the release of this report, a number of commentators shared their views about this report. In ‘David Leitch’s review of GenInsights21’ on 23rd December 2021, David wrote the following: ‘A great example in Section 2 that demonstrates the strengths which GR and GVSC bring to GenInsights21 is the analysis of bid bands over the history of the NEM. This is a wonderful chart that few other organisations have the capacity to produce. At a glance one can see the total history of the NEM, the increasing proportion of very low bids and the increasing proportion of very high bids and the falling proportion of bids in the middle. At the same time there is the total volume produced, by the “Operational sector” almost unchanged in a decade. It is up to each reader to use that “information” to tell the story as they see it – but there the story is, laid out in technicolour for all to see.’ Since that time… Following on from GenInsights21 we have been producing quarterly editions of GenInsights Quarterly Updates series … … but those updates has not included updates to that particular representation. In the years since that red-green-blue representation of bid bands was initially published, there’s been a steady stream of people asking whether the trend has been continuing. Here’s just one example of the question (one received more relatively recently, and which I remembered to save at the time for a future article such as this one): We’ve been aware of these requests, just have not found time to re-run the numbers until this point. Aggregated trend of bids, to 31st December 2023 The trigger of the BofA presentation was a catalyst to updating the numbers through until 31st December 2023 – aligned with both the GSD2023 and also GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q4 . Here’s an update of the same trend – just on a monthly basis, rather than the annual basis used in the GRC2018 all those years ago: It’s a bit busier (being monthly) but if we look past the monthly fluctuations in bid volumes, the changing pattern of bidding is still clearly visible … however in a glance here it does not appear that the volume of bids in green continues to increasingly diminished. We’ll look more below. Also noted on this chart is the increasingly apparent divergence of the two data series: 1) The rise, and rise, of ‘Registered Capacity as Volume’ (i.e. assuming 100% Availability – and notwithstanding the hidden complexities of choosing which measure to use for Installed Capacity ). 2) Which is running away from the (fairly flat) level of Aggregate Volume bid into the market at any price . This is just one illustration of the declining level of aggregate availability across the generation mix in the NEM … which is primarily a reflection of the increasing installed base of energy-constrained plant (i.e. VRE). We can see this below, with aggregate level of availability dropping from 70% down below 55% over the last ~5 years. Updated ratios, to 31st December 2023 To assist readers, we’ve also updated the NEM-wide ratios used in GenInsights21 on a NEM-wide basis: Readers in the context of this article will be most interested in the green trend, which is ‘percentage Volume Bid in Green’ . We can see that: 1) The ratio for many early years of NEM history was around 40% 2) It rose slightly through the ‘oversupplied’ years (2012-2015) 3) Before dropping to a low point reported in the GRC2018 (i.e. at about 30%) at the end of 2018; 4) The decline continued to a point (low 20’s%) for GenInsights21. 5) There was a further decline related to the 2022 Energy Crisis (and particularly to do with conserving scarce fuel supplies as discussed here … whether that was scarce coal, gas or battery charge), 6) But that trend has largely recovered now to the same point reported for GenInsights21 (i.e. low 20’s as a percent). As noted before, with the ratio at such a low level, under certain circumstances it would take less of a event, whatever* that was, to have prices jump markedly (or drop sharply) from below zero to above the $300/MWh cap price. * that contingency event might be some sort of transmission outage (of which we might be seeing an increasing number?), or a major generator trip … or even as simple as a large cloud mass passing over a major population center and dampening rooftop PV. That’s one measure of the increasing level of risk in the NEM.",

    "title": "Simshauser/Gilmore Working Paper speaks to challenges for gas-fired firming",
    "date": "29-04-2024 08:35:00 AM",
    "content": "There’s much to read for those who are trying to keep tabs on the many different threads related to the energy transition (and we’re aware that WattClarity adds to that – hopefully in a positive way). One piece that I’ve quickly skimmed recently was this Working Paper ‘Solving for y: demand shocks from Australia’s gas turbine fleet’ written by Paul Simshauser and Joel Gilmore and published by the Centre for Applied Energy Economics & Policy Research out of Griffith University: I found it more accessible than some other papers (perhaps in part because you need to read about half-way through before confronted with mathematical formulae), and puts into words some questions I’ve had with respect to the challenges of firming in a future NEM that’s dominated by VRE. Quoting from p2/28 we have: ‘In power system planning models with very high levels of VRE, the capacity of last resort takes on a critical role vis-à-vis power system reliability. With few exceptions, all models, and all modellers, currently rely on gas turbines to balance power system demand in a manner that meets the overarching energy policy objective function, viz. to minimise cost subject to reliability and CO2 emission constraints. But the normative dynamic partial equilibrium frameworks that underpin all modern power system planning models necessarily forecast what needs to be done . Frequently, they are not constrained by what can be done , even if by way of ex-cathedra, but nonetheless reasonable, professional judgement. We examine outputs from 12 power system models and 10 modellers – 9 of which are anonymised, the other being Gilmore (2024). All models and all modellers signal sharp episodic increases in gas turbine plant duties. Crucially, all modellers assume, at least implicitly, a gas market that is endlessly flexible . In this sense, modellers have identified what needs to be done. And to be clear, the assumption of endlessly flexible gas markets has proven to be entirely reasoned and reasonable over the past two decades. … there’s another author talking about how a model’s just a model (and perhaps more simplistic than a reader might assume) … However, when we examined model results for the post-coal environment in detail, we found a surprisingly intensive role played by gas turbine plant at common points in time . The modelled output of gas turbine plant would surge in episodic periods of 5-10 days at a time during the winter months of June and July, when solar irradiation is at its lowest and east coast wind output experiences its annual nadir.’ … and onto the next page: ‘The purpose of this article is to test, ex ante, normative electricity market model assumptions by identifying the outer operating boundaries of the adjacent market for natural gas – in essence identifying what can be done , given known market conditions. We do so by relying on a nodal model of the Australian east coast gas market – the same model which predicted the 2018 gas market shortfalls. To summarise our results, gas turbine output during low renewable energy periods associated with winter months appears to be incompatible with the outer operating limits of Australia’s eastern gas market functionality as we currently understand it . If there is any upside to our analysis, it is that sufficient time exists to reconcile otherwise intractable gas turbine dispatch duties with electricity and gas industry capacity. ’ A large amount of firming required, but not very frequently Reading through the report, I see a consistent theme – this new NEM that we’re approaching looks set to require a very large amount of firming capacity installed on the ground, and charged ready to go … but much of it’s not going to be used all that often. 1) That is, for instance, the same high-level conclusion we came to in our ‘Exploring Wind Diversity’ study included as Appendix 27 within GenInsights21 ; 2) It’s just that in this paper the authors look at supplying that firming from gas-fired generation rather than other types of stored-energy assets. Unfortunately it seems too many people can’t see past the low annual averages quoted in summaries of modelled results … as we’ve written before ( such as here ), the NEM is becoming a market/system where the averages are less and less dominant, and the extremes increasingly matter . How will that Firming Capacity be supported (in development, and operations)? The authors ask very necessary questions about whether the right structures are in place to provide support for this very large amount of insurance product that we’ll inevitably require. For instance, here’s some highlights from section 5.1 on p17 and p18 as follows: ‘In the ‘no new pumped hydro scenario’, annual gas used by the gas turbine fleet equates to ~194 PJ/a. Prima facie, there is nothing spectacular about 194 PJ of gas use in a single year – it sits neatly within the bounds of historic gas generation outcomes as illustrated in Figure 3 (i.e. recall the historic range from 2009-2023 was 93-212 PJ/a). However, this scenario exhibits as much as ~3000TJ/d of gas demand from gas turbines alone during critical event days on a NEM-wide basis (cf. 1100TJ/d historically) . Due to the diurnal and seasonal pattern of renewables, limited storage capacity of (4-hour) batteries (which were uneconomic to provide reserve energy for infrequent events) and no new pumped hydros being developed beyond Snowy 2.0 and Kidston, aggregate storages in the power system and the gas market are quickly and routinely exhausted early in the winter months . This scenario is unique, and not contemplated by other modellers or the Market Operator in its annual Integrated System Plan (AEMO includes ~8GW of pumped hydro in its forecasts). GPE Model results for the east Australian gas market for this scenario are illustrated in Figure 11. In Figure 11, the first point to note is that ‘Final Demand’ is represented by the light shaded grey area and represents the combined ‘demand served’ for DomGas and the Gas Turbine Fleet. Conversely, ‘Unserved Demand’, depicted by the dark-shaded area, represents that component of gas turbine demand for natural gas which exceeds modelled system capacity. Figure 11: 2030s post-coal closure scenario with no new pumped hydro In Figure 11, unserved gas demand is very extensive . In aggregate across the two-year window, shortfalls equate to 57 PJ (26 PJ in year 1, 31 PJ in year 2). NSW is forecast to experience more than 40 critical events per annum, and somewhat unexpectedly, Victoria is forecast to experience more than 20 days of shortfalls per annum as well. It is to be noted that we have excluded event days in which demand shortfalls were less than 100TJ/d – our thinking being gas linepack would adequately resolve these. If <100TJ event days are included, NSW critical event days rise to ~55 per annum. ’ Our own questions … and those of Large Energy Users We’ve also been asking similar questions: 1) We wrote almost exactly a year ago that ‘ We’re not building enough replacement dispatchable (i.e. firming) capacity ’ . 2) And I’ve also written about my disappointment that a much touted expansion to the original Capacity Investment Mechanism smelt too much like ‘bait and switch’ as the scheme was padded out by a very large increase in support for VRE, but only a very modest increase in the level of support for the firming capacity we’re bound to need. Coincidentally this week, I’ll be at the EUAA Annual Conference in Melbourne (Wed 1st and Thu 2nd May 2024 ), where long-running concerns about the immature approach to Australia’s energy transition are sure to be a prime topic for conversation. Looking forward to the discussion there!",

That’s what we mean here by ‘our’. 2) So it’s convenient for us to reference these outages via articles collated here on WattClarity to provide placeholders for further discussion. In amongst that group was the article ‘Where’s that major planned outage for YWPS1 go?’ which noted that: (a) The outage had been planned to commence on 15th March 2024; (b) But the outage had been pushed back to now for reasons we did not explore. YWPS1 outage underway This article can serve as a short record that the unit came offline, as per the updated plan, overnight last night – as captured in the ‘coal unit offline’ Notification/Alert in ez2view : Opening up the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view , and filtering down to the YWPS1 unit, we see the unit’s run-down profile: Looking a little deeper (with the ‘MT PASA DUID Availability’ widget in ez2view ), we see the following: At present, the expected return to service is on Tuesday 2nd July 2024 … which would make this outage a (pretty lengthy) 68 days in duration. YWPS4 outage pushed back a little In this note on 22nd March 2024 we saw that the planned outage for YWPS4 was ( at that time ): 1) Starting 24th August 2024 2) running 55 days 3) through until 19th October 2024. But now, checking the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view, we see that the outage plan for this unit has changed, with: 1) A longer outage that’s currently: (a) planned to commence Monday 11th November 2024 ; and (b) planned to end with RTS on Monday 13th January 2025 (c) so now 63 days (slightly longer than planned earlier); 2) With also a shorter outage in August 2024 … presumably for things that can’t wait until November. ‘ Looking up that vertical ’ across the entire 3-year historical range in the grid, we see that the dates for the outage have moved around a fair number of times, so there’s nothing particularly alarming about the most recent changes.

In this, the AEMO notes: ‘Renewable energy generation drove down wholesale prices in the first quarter of 2024 despite higher temperatures pushing up electricity demand. The amount of renewable energy being fed into the grid grew to 39%, up from 37.4% in Q1 2023. AEMO’s latest Quarterly Energy Dynamics report shows that despite heatwave conditions and extreme weather events causing high price volatility, wholesale spot prices on Australia’s east coast were down 8% on Q1 2023, to $76 per megawatt hour (MWh). ’ So the report will be of interest to our readers… (B) Early commentary about the AEMO’s QED for 2024 Q1 For reasons I’m unaware of, there seems less media coverage of this report than there has been with prior editions.

    "title": "A precis of the ‘Exploring Wind Diversity’ analysis completed in Appendix 27 of GenInsights21",
    "date": "21-04-2024 04:49:00 PM",
    "content": "It’s now approaching 2 1 / 2 years since we released GenInsights21 on 15th December 2021 . At that time, and in the period since, we’ve released some snippets of various pieces of content from this 622-page analytical work – with some of these linked through to either: 1) The 22 x Key Observations in the 1st section; and/or 2) The 28 x deeper-dive Appendices that looked at different aspects of the energy transition . It’s also noteworthy that we were invited by the Smart Energy Council to share some insights, which we did via a webinar on 5th April 2022. This webinar is embedded in the subsequent article ‘The Energy Transition – Grappling with the Challenges (recording of presentation on GenInsights21 to Smart Energy Council members and others)’ , complete with some associated notes. In the ~28 months since we released that report, there have been times when we’ve wished to have time to share some of what was conveyed across the 28-page Appendix 27 (titled ‘Exploring Wind Diversity’ ) . 1) The recent wind lull of April 2024 has been another of those occasions … a period that others have called ‘the worst week for wind’ (albeit ‘worst’ in only in a relatively short reference time horizon , as revealed below); 2) But to this point it’s only been in the SEC webinar (at the ~0:40:28 mark) that we’ve shared anything of note. So I thought it would be timely to post this precis as an article. Readers should note, however, that it’s a precis and that they really should read Appendix 27 for the full details … Background to the analysis in Appendix 27 In June 2017 we were amongst many who were surprised (including a number of wind farmers, we heard since!) by amazingly low levels of wind farm production across all the wind farms that existed at the time. … a couple articles were written, and are collated here . Hence when we came to preparation of the GRC2018 (beginning late 2017) this was very much on our minds. Hence in the 180-page analytical component within the GRC2018 we completed a first pass analysis of wind speed diversity across the all Renewable Energy Zones defined in AEMO’s Integrated System Plan 2018 (this was Theme 10). Following from Theme 10 within Part 2 of the GRC2018 , we saw several articles posted on WattClarity , including: 1) For instance, on 26th July 2019 we posted ‘Assessing the diversity of intermittent (wind and solar output) ’ highlighting the analytical framework used to interpret the correlation co-efficient. Two key point for readers are that: (a) there’s three types of outcomes (high correlation, randomness and high anti-correlation) … rather than the two types people typically think of; and (b) why randomness is not the ideal outcome we would be hoping for. … Here’s the table we cut out of the GRC2018 again: 2) On Friday 27th September 2019 the Australian Energy Council’s Carl Kitchen posted this article “Integrating Renewables: An Assessment of Generation Correlation” drawing heavily on the analysis contained within this theme . 3) There was also discussion on 20th October 2020 4) … and on other occasions. In terms of results in GRC2018 : 1) It should not really surprise any reasoned analyst to understand that we found at best merely randomness in wind speeds across all the REZ zones across the NEM: 2) As shown in the table above, that means there’s quite modest System Reliability benefit from wind farms being deployed across the NEM. Of course, this wind speed diversity analysis in the GRC2018 only went so far: 1) Notably it did not take a step further into assessing what it meant in terms of shortfalls (and surpluses) of power (i.e. MW) or energy (i.e. MWh) . 2) Indeed, inside GRC2018 we recommended ‘next steps’ any other analyst might take to further develop our collective understanding of the size and significance of these “wind droughts” . When we began to think about the compilation of GenInsights21 (late in 2020), however, we were disappointed to observe that (to our knowledge) noone had taken up on our recommendation to analyse wind droughts in further detail. So ( as noted here ) we took it upon ourselves to work with a couple people from UQ to complete the analysis that became Appendix 27. Modelling approach With some words-and-pictures below, we’ll attempt to touch on the highlights of the approach we took … but readers should note the clear caveat that you really should read Appendix 27 itself, as it is explained in some detail there! Geographical Spread We started with whatever data we had for ~16 years of historical time-series wind speed measurements for these locations across Australia: There’s approximately 1,000 measurement points across the country – which we allocated to 3 different categories (with a method and reason explained in Appendix 27 ) and used them in these categories to examine different scenarios. With these wind speed readings: 1) we prepared time series profiles stretching back up to 16 years based on the BOM measurements (for each measurement points); 2) we mathematically translated these readings upwards to wind speed readings at typical wind farm hub heights; 3) then translated through a power curve to power readings of a 5-minute cadence for all of these measurement points. Hypothetical Wind + Storage Grid We then constructed a hypothetical grid to supply actual NEM demand for the year – with the study assumption being that this grid would only be supplied by only Wind Farms and Energy Storage of some sort. Whilst this is clearly not a ‘real world’ scenario, we selected this in order to gain an understanding of the nature of ‘wind droughts’ over time … using as much historical data as we could lay our hands on. Simplifying Assumptions In the Appendix we noted that other studies and analytical pieces we see from time to time (including high profile ones) seem to hide and/or make obscure the simplifying assumptions. … remember that ‘a model’s just a model – it’s not reality’ … but some models might be actually be useful. All models must choose from a range of simplifying assumptions they can make. Unfortunately (in our view) by not highlighting the simplifying assumptions (and the effect these will have on the results) some pieces of analysis devalue themselves significantly! Given our strong view, we were very conscious in explicitly and clearly stating up-front the range of simplifying assumptions ad seen at the time, we were very keen to state clearly up-front the simplifying assumptions – including these ones: Again, that caveat that you really should read Appendix 27 itself, as it is explained in some detail there! With these assumptions in hand, we built a grid to supply the actual historical level of demand: 1) By scaling Wind Farms at all locations (depending on the scenario) to supply the required level of energy throughout the study period; 2) And then by scaling the Storage to store the overs and unders caused by the expected mismatch between instantaneous Wind Power Production and demand. Sharing some results Let’s briefly walk through some of the results … Without allowing spillage, it’s a very expensive grid Of course, Spillage was the first item on the agenda to assess. As shown in the results chart here, if we assume the grid can’t spill any surplus wind (an unrealistic option) then we need an astonishingly large volume of storage to store all of the wind: There’s clearly a trade-off in here with respect to construction cost (i.e. increasing wind and reducing storage with higher spillage) and system risk, but there’s a clear knee-point in the chart at about 20% spillage … below which is clear diminishing returns in terms of savings on overcapitalising storage costs. Even with 20% spillage, it’s a large volume of storage (i.e. GWh) required With that established, we then moved forwards on the assumption of 20% spillage. In terms of the level of energy stored in this theoretical reservoir, the trend over the 16 years provides evidence of some significant doldrum periods: The ’wind drought’ of mid 2017 is clearly visible here … but it’s notable that there were 2 other significant ‘wind droughts’ evident in the (only!) ~15 year time range modelled. A key conclusion was that we’re really need to be analysing many decades of history for such an approach to have real credibility. Whilst some years were quite small, in terms of ‘wind drought’, there was also visible a clear seasonal pattern. The above shows GWh storage requirements of approximately ~9,500GWh – that we noted (with reference to topical storage projects): 1) Was the equivalent of ~70,000 units of the (original iteration of the) Hornsdale Power Reserve (at only 129MWh). 2) Was the equivalent of ~25 installations of Snowy 2.0 (which we saw having a reported storage capacity of 350GWh). Unfortunately since that time we’ve seen these comparisons quoted without the underlying context that this is what would be required in a hypothetical grid that only has Wind Farms and Storage as its supply sources. 1) Hopefully posting this article here today will reduce the risk of that happening in future! 2) It should be clear to most reasoned analysts that both of the following are true: (a) Incorporating more generation sources (like solar, for instance) will help to reduce the size of the storage required; but at the same time (b) Notwithstanding the other criticisms of Snowy 2.0 (exploding capital cost, delays in delivery, market power and so on) it’s not credible to think that projects of that scale ‘won’t be required’ in a VRE-dominated grid in future. 3) It’s worth noting that energy stored in the form of gas (and/or liquid fuelled supply) could also help to reduce the volume of energy storage required to store VRE for the proverbial ‘rainy day’. 4) Finally, it’s also worth reiterating the concerns raised in Observation 5/22 in GenInsights21 about the rise of ‘Just in Time’ that are related to these VRE + Storage scenarios. Wind supply in relation to demand Back to our hypothetical grid, however, a next logical question is to look at the scale (in instantaneous GW terms) of wind production from this hypothetical grid in relation to the size of energy demand: With this trend it should be clear to see that: 1) Peak production from Wind reaches ~80GW at times (a) remembering this is in relation to an electricity demand peaking around ~30GW (b) so a large degree of overbuild required … and that’s even before falling down the ‘hydrogen for export’ and/or ‘cables to Asia’ rabbit holes. (c) a useful data point for comparison to other modelled scenarios such as in the AEMO’s Integrated System Plan , and models developed by others. 2) Keep in mind that this 80GW peak production is off the back of an installed wind capacity of above 100GW. 3) So that means a high point for capacity factor approaching quite high levels at times (not as high as 80% because the installed capacity base was over 100GW) … but down to well under 10% at other times. … compare with these long-range stats for actual aggregated wind farm performance . Unders and overs Combining both data series into the following long-range trend, we see the degree to which there would be charging (positive, above the line) and discharging (negative, below the line) from storage: These data points (i.e. at least 60GW of charging ability) would combine with the storage required (of ~9,500GWh) to help guide the type of storage required in this theoretical grid. Remember the caveat! Again, that caveat that you really should read Appendix 27 itself , as it’s explained in much more detail over 28 pages there!",

    "title": "We can’t say yet if grid-breaking thunderstorms are getting worse – but we shouldn’t wait to find out",
    "date": "18-04-2024 04:33:00 PM",
    "content": "On February 13, six transmission line towers in Victoria were destroyed by extreme wind gusts from thunderstorms, leading to forced electricity outages affecting tens of thousands of people. The intense winds knocked trees onto local power lines or toppled the poles, which caused about 500,000 people to lose power. Some people went without electricity for more than a week. A month earlier, severe thunderstorms and wind took out five transmission towers in Western Australia and caused widespread outages. Intense thunderstorm events have made news in recent years, including the January 2020 storms that caused the collapse of six transmission towers in Victoria . Perhaps the most far-reaching storms were those in 2016, when all of South Australia lost power for several hours after extreme winds damaged many transmission towers. So are these thunderstorms with extreme winds getting worse as the climate changes? It’s possible, but we can’t yet say for sure. That’s partly because thunderstorms involve small-scale processes harder to study than bigger weather systems. How can wind topple a giant transmission tower? Many people saw the photos of transmission towers bent like thin wire and wondered how it was possible. The reason is physics. When wind hits a structure, the force it applies is roughly proportional to the wind speed squared. When wind gusts are stronger than about 100 kilometres per hour, even just for a few seconds, there can be a risk of damage to infrastructure. Direction matters too. Wind has greater force when it blows more directly towards a surface. If strong winds blow from an unusual direction, risk of damage can also increase. Old trees, for instance, may be more firmly braced against prevailing winds – but if storm winds blow from another direction, they might topple onto power lines. On February 13, a strong cold front was approaching Victoria from the southeast, bringing thunderstorms with extreme wind gusts over 120 km/h after a period of extreme heat. Thunderstorms can create extremely strong and localised gusty winds, sometimes called “ microbursts ” due to cold heavy air falling rapidly out of the clouds. These winds were enough to bend towers and topple trees and poles. Are these thunderstorm winds getting worse? Scientific evidence clearly shows climate change is steadily worsening hazards such as extreme heatwaves and bushfires, which can damage our grid and energy systems. On balance, evidence suggests tropical cyclones may become less frequent but more severe on average. All but one of Australia’s tropical cyclones this summer have been severe (Category 3 or higher). But we aren’t yet certain what climate change does to extreme winds from thunderstorms. This is because high-quality observations of past thunderstorms are relatively rare, with large variability in how often storms occur and their severity, and because climate models have difficulties simulating the small-scale processes which give rise to thunderstorms. The evidence we do have suggests continued climate change may potentially increase the risk of extreme winds from thunderstorms. This is partly due to more moist and unstable air, which are essential for thunderstorms to form . We think these conditions could occur more often with climate change, in part because warmer air can hold more moisture. We also know the severity of thunderstorms can be affected by vertical wind shear , which is the way the wind changes with height. To date, we’re less certain about how wind shear will change in the future. Recent research by coauthor Andrew Brown and the lead author suggests climate change is likely causing more favourable conditions for thunderstorms with damaging winds, particularly in inland regions of Australia. But the methods used for these predictions are new, meaning more research needs to be done for further insight on what climate change will do to extreme winds. We shouldn’t wait to find out Modelling extreme wind gusts is still in its infancy. But given so much of our electricity grid is exposed to extreme winds, it’s important we try to address this gap in our knowledge. It’s safe to say we should treat these storms as a warning. We should factor the risks from extreme winds into how we design our energy systems. It’s especially important as we build a grid able to handle clean energy that we anticipate these kinds of risks from extreme weather. Hardening the grid by burying powerlines and removing vegetation isn’t the only option. We could build a smarter grid , with distributed renewables and energy storage including large as well as relatively smaller (e.g., community-level or household-level) batteries, giving the grid greater resilience including against extreme weather events. In the wake of South Australia’s devastating 2016 grid outage , authorities moved to boost grid resilience in this way, building big batteries, more renewables and new interconnectors, while Australia’s energy market operator AEMO changed how it dealt with windfarms if grid issues occur. Power grids are the largest machines in the world. As we move to a clean energy grid, we face complex challenges – not just in building it, but in protecting it against extreme weather. We would be well served if we work to better understand the risks of compound events, such as combinations of extreme winds, fires or floods hitting a region around the same time. We also need accurate predictions of risks shortly before extreme winds or other disasters strike, as well as effective long-term planning for the risks likely to increase due to climate change or during different climate cycles such as El Niño and La Niña. If we get this response wrong, our energy bills will rise too much and, worse, we still might not have a more resilient system. Since our energy networks are regulated by a complex set of government rules, reform is not just something for industry to address. It must ultimately be led by government – and guided by evidence.

    "date": "18-04-2024 01:57:00 PM",
    "content": "A weeklong stretch of low wind power was broken on Wednesday evening, as a weak cold front marched across southern Australia. The chart below shows that the National Electricity Market (NEM) has endured a weeklong stretch of low wind generation, with wind power providing around 6% of the NEM’s electricity, down from last year’s average of 13.1% (Mon, April 15 to Wed, April 17). The daily wind generation has been under 41 GWh/day for the last seven days leading up to Thursday, April 18. The calmest winds occurred on Sunday, April 14 with only 24 GWh/day produced or 4.6% of grid demand. To put this in perspective, the average daily wind generation during the last year up to Wednesday, April 17, 2024, was 71 GWh/day, according to data from the open NEM. This prolonged period of low wind was caused by blocking high pressure systems sitting over southern Australia, forcing cold fronts or strong wind further south. The image below shows the Mean Sea Level Pressure chart on the calmest day, Sunday, April 14, with high pressure stubbornly sitting over the southern half of the country. Mean Sea Level Pressure Analysis at 4am AEST on Sunday, April 14. Source: Bureau of Meteorology A positive Southern Annular Mode ( SAM ) has led to consistent high pressure systems positioned over latitudes well south of Australia during the first three months of the year and during this week. This has kept cold fronts south of the mainland, and even south of Tasmania. The chart below shows the mean sea level pressure (MSLP) anomalies from January through to the end of March. Orange means higher pressure than the average, blue means lower pressure than the average. Long story short, the intense cold fronts south of Tasmania have been blocked from moving further north by the consistent highs. Source: climatereanalyzer.org The period of light winds ended abruptly on Wednesday evening, with WattClarity reporting that wind production peaking above 3,000 MW at 9:10pm AEST. The increased wind power on Wednesday night, was caused by a couple of factors; A weak cold front swept across the southeast on Wednesday, bringing stronger winds. A very shallow temperature inversion formed in the early evening protecting the surface from the stronger winds, but the wind turbine hub-height (150m) winds remained strong at around 28-38 km/h in SA. Temperature inversions form at night when the ground cools quicker than the air above it, meaning that the temperature increases with height for a thin layer of the atmosphere. During autumn, the temperature inversions are commonly shallow meaning that while the wind could be weak at the surface, the hub heights could continue to experience strong winds. A similar phenomenon could happen again tonight across southern Australia, with another cold front passing across the south. Looking ahead, light winds are expected to continue from Friday as a stubborn high-pressure system builds over the Bight until early to mid-next week.

    "title": "AER Wholesale Markets Quarterly published for 2024 Q1 … first in the triptych",
    "date": "18-04-2024 01:48:00 PM",
    "content": "As seems now to be the pattern, the first in the triptych of detailed quarterly reviews comes from the Australian Energy Regulator, with their report released on Thursday 18th April 2024: The Report Other Materials You can download the 22-page PDF of the report here (which seems shorter than prior issues?): Further information about the Wholesale Markets Quarterly was published by the AER here on their website . With respect to the AER’s Wholesale Markets Quarterly report for 2024 Q1, readers might like to note the following: (A) What AER notes about the report Coincidentally, the AER released this Media Release ‘More intense summer weather contributes to increased wholesale energy prices’ to accompany the report. In this, the AER notes: ‘The report also shows that average quarterly electricity prices in QLD and VIC increased by 20% and 9% respectively compared to the corresponding quarter in 2023. The 2023-24 summer was Australia’s third warmest on record, marked by widespread and persistent heat.’ and… ‘AER Board member Jarrod Ball said weather events played an important role in this quarter’s price outcomes. This was most significant in northern states, particularly QLD where maximum daily demand exceeded the previous all-time record three times during the quarter. “Although the summer heat and the power system event in Victoria on 13 February meant that wholesale prices in Queensland and Victoria were higher than the same time last year, all other regions were lower than the first quarter of 2023,” Mr Ball said. By contrast, in VIC and SA there was reduced demand on the energy grid at times which resulted in first quarter minimum daily demand records, due to the increased generation by rooftop solar systems on sunny yet mild summer days (when air-conditioner use is low).’ So the report will be of interest to our readers… (B) Early commentary about the AER’s Wholesale Markets Quarterly report for 2024 Q1 We’ve not yet scanned extensively to see what media coverage there is of the report – but, where we come across other articles, we’ll add them in here: 1) Here on WattClarity : (a) There’s this note, obviously 2) In the AFR I have seen… (a) Nothing at this point. 3) In the Australian I have seen … (a) Nothing at this point. 4) In the Guardian I have seen … (a) I’ve not seen anything from Peter Hannam or others 5) In SMH and the Age I have seen … (a) I’ve not seen anything from Foley and Nick Toscano or others 6) In RenewEconomy I have seen … (a) On Thursday 18th April, Giles Parkinson wrote ‘Renewables drive down prices in first quarter, but heatwaves and outages cause spikes in coal dominated grids’ . 7) In PV Magazine I have seen … (a) I’ve not seen anything yet 8) In the ABC I have seen … (a) I’ve not seen anything yet from Daniel Mercer or others As a reader here, if you come across any other useful commentary, feel free to add as a comment below.",

    "title": "Summer reflections",
    "date": "18-04-2024 12:57:00 PM",
    "content": "This article reviews the summer of 2024 which was a wild ride consisting of volatile spot prices, market price expectations having a mixed performance, the consolidation of the twin peaks dynamic, and battery energy storage systems having a tough day in the office. Summer of 2024 concluded after having the lowest January Victorian spot prices in history; followed by a wild Victorian storm crumpling transmission towers causing 500,000 customers to be load shed with maximum spot prices set for almost 2-hours. Queensland pushed through maximum demand records; and the ‘twin peaks’ phenomena is now an entrenched feature of summers. The predicted hot and dry summer did not eventuate to the same severity as predicted, although February and March were generally hotter than long term averages and drier. Weather We understand forecasting is tricky business, and so the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) weather prediction issued before summer led farmers to de-stock in fear of a hot and dry summer causing lamb and beef prices to fall. AEMO issued a call for additional Demand-Side Response through the Long RET program as Victoria and South Australia system looked precarious. However, the actual weather pattern took control of its own destiny with: January being slightly cooler than average in MEL, and then SYD delivered the warmest variation from the long-term average temperatures; but the month was much wetter than the long-term average across all the mainland Capital Cities February and March lived up to predictions of a warmer summer, but then BNE was much wetter while the southern States a lot drier. SYD also had an exceptionally dry March. The table below shows the maximum average daily temperature deviation (degrees) from the long-term average; and then the deviation from the long-term rainfall (mm) for each Capital City. Twin Peaks Economic theory says that demand and supply relationships drive prices, leading to the classical outcome that the higher the demand, the higher the price. Well, in the electricity market this is not so, but instead we have twin peaks. The maximum demand no longer necessarily aligns with the highest spot price, instead we have the maximum demand point, and then the maximum price point. The coincidence of these two maxims is no longer aligned. The cause of these phenomena which had started a few years ago is the impact of solar generation (both roof-top and utility scale). Peak demand is occurring when the sun is above the horizon but once the sun sets, spot prices surge despite demand softening. The next chart shows the solar generation, operational demand and the spot price outcomes for a sample day of 23 February in Queensland. The operational demand peaked at 5:30pm, but the prices peaked later at around 6:50pm, after the solar had set. When we noticed how clearly this phenomenon had grown this summer, we wondered whether battery storage was the cause. The hypothesis went along the lines that battery storage was dispatched to protect the maximum demand position, and then became exhausted as demand softened; at which point the spot prices surged. But alas, the answer was simpler than that. It was and is, simply the setting sun putting solar to rest for the day. However, these types of days are a difficult day in the office for the battery sector, as demonstrated on this same sample day. The batteries were dispatched (green line on chart) when prices generally exceeded $1,000/MWh, but were only half dispatched at the critical extreme prices at 6:50pm ($14,900) and 7:00pm ($11,680). The frustration of missing the chance to maximise the revenue is compounded when it is also possible by not fully dispatching at the critical times, may have contributed to the strength of the price spikes. Our monthly reports track and report on the actual performance of battery energy storage systems against the theoretical capture value for each month and rolling annual basis. We also track the performance of all wind and solar farms. New Demand Records Queensland set new demand records as shown by the chart below which has the operational demand plus the roof-top solar forming the native demand. On this high-demand day, the operational demand exceeded AEMO’s forecast by about 500MW which is very material so we are sure this will cause some internal review of the forecasting algorithm. It is also a stark reminder of how much pent-up demand there exists in our system. On 22 January, QLD’s Operational Demand was 11,005MW , and at this point of time there was another 1,000MW of Solar PV, and the maximum demand earlier in the day was 12,651MW. We wonder if Sydney, Melbourne or Adelaide had an extreme weather day, how much pent-up demand would surface? Time will tell. The forward QLD Q1-24 forward price pushed upward as a consequence of these hot days reaching a maximum closing price of $130/MWh for the quarter, and then finally settled at an average spot price for the month of $118/MWh. Victorian Storm The most notable severe weather event knocking transmission towers over was in September 2016 in South Australia when the State went ‘black’. Well, this summer it was Victoria’s turn although the storm triggered event was not as severe as South Australia’s. There were 6 transmission towers knocked down causing 2,690MW of generation to trip and 1,000MW of load to be shed. On 13 February 2024 , spot prices jumped to the price cap and remained there for just under 2-hours. Tasmania followed suit but lasted for only 1 hour and 10 minutes. None of the other Regions were materially impacted. The chart below shows the Victorian spot prices along with the Operational Demand on 13 February 2024: This February event followed the lowest Victorian January average spot price in history of only $22.10/MWh and caused the VIC Q1-24 forward price to jump from the doldrums of $31/MWh to surge to $83/MWh on 13 February before falling $21/MWh the next day to around $52/MWh. The quarterly average price finished at $51.67/MWh, although excluding the 13 February would have only been $36.31/MWh. However, this event did lead to soft demand in the aftermath because it took in some cases days for power to be fully restored. Return of Callide C Callide C’s Unit 3 which has been offline since October 2022 had its return-to-service date delayed multiple times over the past year and finally returned-to-service the afternoon of 1 April . By the end of June, both units are due to be online well before Q1-25 and are expected to be available at full capacity (880MW). Surprisingly, the forward market for QLD Q1-25 is at similar levels of Q1-24 (circa $118/MWh) given the return of Callide C and other renewable projects coming online during this year. Undertaking a simple analysis of the Q1-24 spot prices with the published spot price sensitivities shows that a 500MW reduction in demand for all half hours (which is equivalent to an increase in supply of 500MW), would have shifted the spot price from an average of $118/MWh to $51/MWh for the quarter. Obviously, the spot outcomes have many interactions and therefore this simple indicator is not a detailed modelling effort of the expected outcome. Nevertheless, this brief analysis does show that for some reason the forward market is not recognising the potential impact of Callide C being available for next summer. The chart below shows the average quarterly price sensitivity for Q1-24 with a demand reduction of 100MW, 200MW and 500MW price sensitivity. Tracking of Q1-24 Looking at the comparison between the actual quarterly spot price and the expectations of the quarter shows that: QLD trade weighted average for the quarter was about $128/MWh, about $10/MWh above the actual spot price ($118/MWh). The latest forward price just before the quarter started was $116/MWh, slightly under the actual spot price but very close NSW trade weighted average price was $131/MWh, well above the actual spot price of $87/MWh; and the final forward price before the quarter started was almost $104/MWh, also a premium to the actual result VIC trade weighted average price was $79/MWh before the quarter started on the back of a predicted hot and dry summer that was partially true. The events of 13 February increased the actual spot price to almost $52/MWh, well below the last forward price before the quarter started of almost $67/MWh SA trade weighted average price before the quarter started was almost $112/MWh which was more than twice the actual spot price of $55/MWh and also well below the last forward price of $102/MWh prior to the quarter starting TAS average forward price was $65/MWh which was very close to the actual spot price of $67/MWh that was impacted by the Victorian 13 February event Looking back at our forecasts of Q1-24, the dials below represent our distributions between the 5 th and 95 th percentiles. The dark coloured segments mark our 25 th to 75 th percentile and the white line in the dark coloured segment represents the median of our forecast. The results show that the actual spot prices were between our 25 th percentile and median forecasts reflecting they were consistently lower than expected: QLD finished slightly under our median spot forecast NSW finished closer to our 25th percentile and given the weather in Sydney was not too testing, this was not surprising VIC with the hot and dry weather forecast could have been a lot stronger but with the record low January, dampened the quarterly average even though the 13 February increased the average markedly SA finished just under our median and also given the low number of extreme weather days, dampened the quarterly average TAS finished closer to our 25th percentile, and was expected to be a lot stronger than transpired Comparison of Probabilistic Spot Forecast and Actual Spot Prices Q1-24 Our ability to correctly evaluate the forward price level was as follows: QLD traded at an average of $128/MWh which we regarded as fair given the risk. Our median spot price was slightly lower at $125/MWh which was closer to the actual spot price of $118/MWh NSW forward market price level was in our top quartile and was correctly deemed as most likely over-valued given the actual spot price was only $87/MWh VIC forward market was considered most likely over-valued at $79/MWh and the final forward price of close to $67/MWh was considered fair, sitting just below our 75th percentile. Our median forecast of $55.48/MWh was closer to the actual spot price of $51.67/MWh, but could have easily been higher SA forward price of $112/MWh was regarded as most likely over-valued sitting in the top 5% of our simulations. The actual price of $55.08/MWh was below our 25th percentile, and therefore could have been easily much higher with an expected case of $84/MWh, but our view that the SA forward price was most likely over-valued was correct TAS forward price was remarkedly close to the average spot price and we expected the spot price could have been easily much stronger. The actual spot price finished just above our 25th percentile. Conclusion As with all summer quarters, there was a story to tell. Summer of 2024 contained a mixed range of outcomes including record low spot prices, spot prices sitting at the cap for nearly 2-hours, record demand levels set, and there is an open question of pent-up demand levels driven by the installation of varying types of cooling systems becoming standard practice in our homes. Our focus now moves onto the winter quarters, with just as many challenges to predict and understand the dynamics. This article was originally posted on EnergyByte .

    "content": "NEM-wide wind production peaked above 3,000MW on Wednesday evening 17th April 2024 – as captured this morning in this snapshot from NEMwatch at 09:10 ( NEM time ): That’s several days earlier than we noted Tuesday when we wrote that the ‘NEM-wide wind lull stretches extends to a full week (Tue 16th April 2024), and has another week to go!’ . Changing AEMO forecasts I’d noted that the forecast had surprised on the upside in this article yesterday afternoon , and what happened last night was stronger than was forecast a few hours earlier, on Wednesday afternoon. Thankfully with the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view , we can ‘ look up a vertical ’ to view ‘that other dimension of time’ … such as in this view of NEM-wide UIGF for Wind back a week and forward a week, snapped at 09:20: I’ve annotated with a few key points. Remember to click on the image to open in larger screen view. Looking up the red verticals, it appears that Thursday afternoon and Friday afternoon we might see yields around 4,000MW on a NEM-wide basis (barring economic curtailment and/or network curtailment , of course). If so, this would be about half of the current long-term maximum . Changing underlying weather conditions? Reaching out to WattClarity readers who are meteorologically trained to see if there’s something written that might help explain the changing nature of these forecasts? PS1 comment by Christian Werner at Global Weather Climate Analytics Over on LinkedIn here, Christian Werner wrote the following, in response to this request: ‘Thanks Paul McArdle for the update. Forecasts are always changing and what we prefer is that there is some consistency in the forecast updates (to comment here on the exact details to why and how forecasts are changing is outside the scope here). From the forecast data we look at it all made sense that we should see a wind generation increase in TAS and VIC at first, driven by the approaching cold front. This was already known for a few days. Due to the high pressure frontolytic characteristics the cold front will decay and we should see a widening of the isobars again and with it a decrease in wind generation. Complicating factor is a semi-persistent trough. Further down the track wind generation should pick up again as the SPV is edging closer to Australia. Not sure what AEMO is using for the wind generation forecasts but based on what was reported here there is certainly room for improvements. ‘ PS2 from Weatherzone Also in response to this request, Weatherzone contributed the article ‘Generation gone with the wind’ on WattClarity. Surprised on the upside (this time) On this occasion, the wind yield seems to be surprising on the upside, compared to earlier forecasts. But that’s also a timely reminder that it also does surprise on the low-side. I wonder whether each is equally likely (or not?).",

    "date": "17-04-2024 04:10:00 PM",
    "content": "On Tuesday we noted that the ‘NEM-wide wind lull stretches extends to a full week (Tue 16th April 2024), and has another week to go!’ , which followed from Monday’s article about ‘Low wind production on Monday morning 15th April 2024’ . 1) That’s led to a bit of discussion online 2) Looking at the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view now (no image included here), it seems AEMO’s more recent ST PASA and P30 predispatch forecasts have NEM-wide Wind UIGF picking up sooner than earlier forecasts. So the lull might be shorter lived than was noted on Tuesday morning. Looking back a couple weeks Using the NEMreview v7 application, here’s a trend of aggregate Large-Scale VRE production across the NEM: The way it looks at the moment, the lowest point for aggregate Large-Scale VRE would be the 17:55 dispatch interval on Saturday 13th April 2024 . Note that: 1) This looks to be the lowest aggregate Wind + Large Solar (at 783MW); 2) But it should be clear that: (a) The contribution from wind at the time (at 714MW) may not be the lowest in the time range; and also (b) The contribution from solar (at 69MW, almost at sunset) won’t be the lowest in the time range. 3) Further, it should be noted that this time may not be the time of peak firming requirement (i.e. we’ll look more systematically at Aggregate Scheduled Target when we compile GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2024 Q2 in a few months). But an interesting timepoint, none-the-less. Drilling into 17:55 on Sat 13th April 2024 Using a large screen dashboard to ez2view , I’ve grabbed this image time-travelled back to 17:55 on Saturday 13th April 2024 with the main purpose being to see if there were any particular wind farms across the NEM that were performing with reasonable or high capacity factors: With this one, definitely click on the image to open in larger screen view in order to be able to read! With this display: 1) I’ve highlighted on the ‘NEM Map’ widget the contributions from each of the regions: (a) QLD (132MW) + NSW (60MW) + VIC (198MW) + TAS (127MW) + SA (196MW). (b) so no region had relatively high performance. 2) On the 4 x Regional Schematics shown (apologies for not also showing TAS) I have manually highlighted some of the wind farms that jumped out at me on a quick scan (a) remember my purpose to find any wind farms that were performing well (b) alas all of them appeared to be ‘running on fumes’ . Nothing more, at this point – but more might come later (e.g. perhaps when we’re compiling GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2024 Q2 in a few months).",

    "content": "Given the articles (on Monday 15th April and also this morning ) about the recent wind lull, I thought it was worth updating this long-range trend of monthly statistics: Clients with their own licence to the NEMreview software can open their own copy of this trend here . This chart contains many stories – with some headlines being that: 1) In terms of high points : (a) The all-time maximum production is still currently base on what happened on Friday evening 7th July 2023 , when the aggregate wind production peaked at 8,132MW at 19:20. (b) But it was the month of June 2023 that saw a higher capacity factor (40.9% for the month), notwithstanding … i. some challenges with choosing which installed capacity to use as the denominator ; and also ii. that Capacity Factor is an increasingly simplistic method for reporting performance . 2) In terms of low points : (a) These continue to bump around the bottom of the chart, with instantaneous capacity factor in the range of 1% to 4%, or slightly higher on a good month (b) But remember that the low points might be increasingly affected by curtailment (which is on the rise, and was a particular focus for Semi-Scheduled units in the GSD2023 ) (c) In terms of standouts: i. The wind drought of June 2017 remains a standout low point in NEM history. ii. though perhaps when we come to fully review 2024 Q2 , what’s currently happening might be also be a standout? 3) In terms of averages (or aggregate levels of production across the month): (a) We see the aggregate capacity factor has stabilized (with greater diversity of installed wind farms) to be typically oscillating between 25% and 35% in a month, with a few months breaking through either side of that typical range. (b) The dark green line shows the trend for increased aggregate production over time: i. As new wind farms continue to come onto the grid; ii. Though obviously seasonally affected. We’ll continue to keep an eye … particularly towards the end of 2024 Q2 , which is when we’d expect (based on seasonal patterns) to see the next step upwards in the NEM-wide wind production patterns.",

Almost 7 days under 10% of Grid Demand Readers will understand that (except for the absolute extremes) it’s a bit arbitrary to declare what’s a period of ‘low wind’ (or a period of ‘high wind’, as well) … but in this case we can see a stretch where aggregate wind production has been under 10.5% of Grid Demand for a prolonged stretch that has now well into its 6th day . … surely that qualifies! To see some long-range trends of wind production statistics, see this growing collection of articles . Still some days to run, also … On the right of the chart is the AEMO’s forecast UIGF for Wind Production, which shows that this wind lull has a few days left to run, as well. To see more detail about this stretch of low wind, I’ve opened up the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget within our installed ez2view software and filtered down to UIGF Wind on a NEM-wide basis: Frequent readers here (and those with their own licence to the ez2view software so they can use this widget) will remember this allows one to ‘ look up a vertical ’ in order to see ‘that other dimension of time’ . The colour scaling here is set on a dynamic basis, with the highest point in the grid being back almost a full week ago (i.e. ~15:00 on Tuesday 9th April 2024): 1) In the (almost) 7 days that have followed , to date, we see that: (a) The diagonal shows a prolonged period of blue colours (signifying low wind ); (b) But thankfully we also see that these low points were forecast well in advance… … so in the hypothetical future grid that’s heavy on wind and storage, such as we analysed in Appendix 27 within GenInsights21 , you’d at least have had some forewarning to stock away what energy reserves you had available to be drawn down through this period. 2) Unfortunately, we’re also seeing some pretty muted colours (i.e. low wind harvest) stretching out for another week into the future.

About Callide C3 Remember that this unit: 1) came offline since 31st October 2022 following a cooling tower failure , and 2) came back online on 1st April 2024 (518 days later) Given one of the questions we received was (this afternoon) about how the unit was performing, I thought it was worth sharing this snapshot from the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget within ez2view focused on the CPP_3 unit at 15:45 this afternoon, and looking back 11 days. We see in the chart that (as of Thursday afternoon) it was almost exactly 10 days since the unit started to return to service (on Monday 1st April 2024) : 1) the unit has progressively increased its output (currently sitting at 320MW); 2) most of the time bidding down at –$1,000/MWh at the RRN; 3) with many rebids mentioning ‘condenser back pressure’ . 4) As noted in this article on 25th March , the expectation was that the unit would be fully available on 11th April (i.e. today), but note: (a) We can’t see the Availability in the bid for today yet, because it’s part of the ‘next day public’ data set; (b) But we can see the output this afternoon is not back to 466MW … not that you’d expect it to be given the rooftop PV juggernaut that’s carving out an increasing share of daytime Underlying Consumption.

About Callide C4 Remember that this unit: 1) came offline on 25th May 2021 when the turbo-generator exploded (thankfully with no casualties, but with major impacts on the grid and the financial performance of the station), and 2) is still offline today Given other questions have been about return-to-service expectations for this unit, I thought it useful to provide the current view (as of 16:15 this afternoon) of the MT PASA DUID Availability forecast in that widget in ez2view : With this widget we see that: 1) The expectation is: (a) An initial return to service date of 30th June 2024 at part-load; and then (b) Back to full availability about a month later (on DD July 2024). 2) So, in other words, no change since this update on 15th January 2024 .

    "content": "Having written about ‘Increase in NSW to QLD transfer limit on QNI to 850MW’ earlier today, and used the NEMreview v7 software to prepare a trend of daily stats for QNI across ~10 years, we thought it useful to prepare the similar trend for the Murraylink (DC) interconnector between VIC and SA, albeit only looking back ~15 months to the start of January 2023: In this trend we see that flow is typically west (i.e. from VIC into SA), which is the positive direction for this interconnector 1) Frequent readers will know already that this is the case, because VIC is a net energy exporter (as is QLD), whereas SA is a net energy importer (as is NSW); 2) Makes it interesting to think what effect Project Energy Connect might have, when it is eventually up and running, in that: (a) It will connect two regions that are typically net energy importers in any case; and (b) That’s even before considering the closure of Eraring (and also thermal plant in South Australia.

AEMO, TransGrid, Powerlink have reviewed the test results following the QNI minor testing on 15th February 2024. The next hold point can now be released. The hold point of 850 MW from NSW to Qld will be implemented as of 1000 hrs 10th April 2024 . Please also refer to the published formal QNI minor testing information at the following link: https://www.aemo.com.au/consultations/current-and-closed-consultations/qld-to-nsw-interconnector-qni-upgrade Ben Blake AEMO Operations ——————————————————————- END OF REPORT ——————————————————————- Back on 3rd February, Dan had noted a +50MW increase in export limit added for the purpose of testing QNI minor. That was one step in the testing process. I thought it would be of interest to some to use NEMreview v7 to produce this trend of daily flow data for the NSW1-QLD1 interconnector (a.k.a. QNI): From this we can see a number of things across the past ~10 years: 1) With positive flow being ‘export’ from NSW to QLD we can see that: (a) Daily average flows through the 10 year period were on most days negative (i.e. from QLD into NSW). (b) A notable exception was the summer 2023-24 period, where average flows were northwards for many days … understandable in part because of: i. the higher level of demand in QLD (not just the extremes of 22nd Jan 2024 ); and ii. and also the absence of Callide C3 (recently returned) and Callide C4 (still offline). 2) There’s larger capability to export QLD to NSW (i.e. the import limit on QNI) than there is to export NSW to QLD (i.e. the export limit on QNI). 3) With respect to the export limit, there are three days flagged in 2019 where the export limit on QNI was (at least for one dispatch interval) higher than the new 850MW limit that we’ll be progressing to above. (a) These days were as follows: i. 13th July 2019 ii. 9th Sept 2019 iii. 29th Sept 2019 (b) but they have not been further investigated at this point Nothing more, at this point.",

    "title": "Optimising a highly renewable NEM from scratch, Part 2",
    "date": "08-04-2024 04:45:00 PM",
    "content": "As discussed in our previous note (Part 1) in this publication , ITK built a renewable NEM from scratch, aimed at meeting NEM-wide CY2025 demand. We focussed on generating a VRE portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio, that is, the portfolio where average output could not be increased without also increasing variability. That study took no account of transmission. In Part 2 below, we include an estimate of transmission but still require the portfolio to have VRE meeting a series of targeted “Sharpe” ratios; the ratio becoming a constraint, while the optimiser minimises cost. AEMO-modelled demand for CY2025 must be met in every half-hour period by the modelled VRE portfolio in combination with a fixed quantity of hydro (equal to historic NEM output), storage (pumped hydro, or more likely batteries) and variable quantity of gas. As hydro and storage output were fixed throughout the analysis, the quantity of gas power and gas generation are outputs of the model. A map of ITK’s preferred VRE portfolio – with the constraint Sharpe ratio ≥ 4 – is shown in Figure 1 below. Figure 1: ITK Preferred VRE Portfolio Map We use the portfolios generated to estimate the resulting electricity price that would provide a net present value (NPV) of zero in each case. Based on our (no doubt optimistic) cost assumptions, these prices turn out to be in the $60-$70 / MWh range, similar to that of consultants who looked at the NSW, Queensland and Victorian grid decarbonisation plans. If nothing else, this demonstrates that spending $200bn doesn’t result in a dramatic increase in electricity prices, quite the reverse. Eliminating most fuel and other variable costs leads to a stable and predictable price that is globally competitive. Our cost estimate does not include rooftop solar; it is taken as a “free good”. The authors learned a lot from this exercise, and we are grateful to AEMO for the data that makes such studies possible. Key Findings Based on the results from these desktop studies and subject to the numerous limitations discussed herein: Targeting improved system reliability and reduced emissions drives the model towards greater reliance on wind, particularly situated at the fringes of the grid. This approach necessitates a more interconnected NEM and therefore increased initial investment in transmission networks but reduced firming costs in the long run. The lowest cost solutions feature greater solar capacity, located closer to demand centres but extra firming gas to deal with resulting volatility. Figure 2 and Table 1 illustrate the two extremes, namely minimum cost over a short amortisation period and maximum system stability. Figure 2: REZ Map for 10-Year Min-Cost (left) and Sharp-Optimized (right) VRE Portfolio Table 1 : System trade-offs Minimum Cost / Short Amortisation Maximum Stability / Long Amortisation More solar, close to demand centres. Lower Transmission Network Costs Lower VRE Capital Lower VRE stability (Sharpe ratio) Higher Firming Requirements Higher Emissions Higher OPEX More Wind, located towards fringes of grid. Higher Transmission Network Costs Higher VRE Capital Higher VRE stability (Sharpe ratio) Lower Firming Requirements Lower Emissions Lower OPEX Amortising the system’s capital costs over longer periods yields similar results to increasing system reliability and reducing emissions. Namely, the compounding cost of fuel to supply firming gas plants over a longer period acts to disincentivise solar, driving greater reliance on wind energy especially at the fringes of the grid and, again, a more interconnected NEM. Figure 3 shows the Capital + 25-Year OPEX costs of systems modelled to minimize cost over 10-, 15-, 20-, and 25-year periods respectively. Figure 3: 25-Year Cost Breakdown for Portfolio Optimized at 10-, 15-, 20- & 25-Years Amortization [1] With slightly higher upfront investment – compared to the lowest cost solution – we can significantly reduce carbon emissions and improve VRE portfolio stability by building a highly-interconnected system more heavily weighted towards quality wind assets at the fringes of the grid. To achieve this practically, ITK’s preferred VRE portfolio minimizes total system cost over 25 years subject to exceeding a minimum system reliability requirement (Sharpe ratio ≥ 4). See Figure 4 which shows cost breakdown for three key scenarios. Figure 4: Cost Breakdown and Mt CO 2 -e for: Min Cost, ITK Preferred, and Sharpe-Optimized Portfolios In virtually all simulations and sensitivities, QLD ends up as a significant supplier of VRE and were it not for the higher costs of underwater DC transmission, TAS would also be favoured as a large exporter of wind. More wind in QLD – particularly in the Northern half of QLD – and more QLD/NSW interconnect capacity will be “low regrets” options in building out the low carbon NEM. Figure 5: ITK Preferred Portfolio Generation and Demand [2] per State. Method Starting with a fresh sheet of paper, we build a wind and solar portfolio from AEMO’s renewable energy zones (REZ’s) – as detailed in the 2024 Draft Integrated System Plan (ISP) – add in existing behind the meter, and firm it with batteries, hydro, and gas to meet NEM-wide operational demand in every half-hour period for the calendar year 2025. We build multiple such systems using an optimization algorithm, each time varying the set of constraints/incentives given to the optimizer. The system constraints in each scenario are a combination of: Volatility minimization – The Sharpe ratio of a portfolio is inversely proportional to its variability. Practically, we sought to maximise the stability of the VRE portfolio by increasing its Sharpe ratio. Cost Minimization – Costs included: VRE Portfolio capital cost and fixed OPEX. Transmission Network capital cost. Storage capital cost. Firming Gas capital cost and running fuel cost. Hydro OPEX. TAS Generation limit – When stated, we assume that Tasmanian generation surplus to state demand must be transmitted to Victoria, therefore incurs DC transmission costs. REZ generation limits – Capacity of wind and solar for each REZ are set to the “Renewable Potential (MW)” values stated in AEMO’s 2024 Draft ISP. VRE Portfolio generation – represented as the ratio VRE Portfolio Gen / NEM CY25 Demand . Sensitivity analysis shows that ~100% – 110% of NEM CY25 demand is ideal. Years’ OPEX included in total system cost. Battery power and storage are fixed at 15 GW and 4 hours . Hydro power and capacity are fixed at 7.5 GW and 14 TWh . These values could be optimized in future simulations, as we know that for any given VRE portfolio, more battery/hydro means less gas and vice versa. Firming / Seasonality A VRE portfolio with annual output equal to or greater than demand in the NEM inevitably requires “firming” supplied by some combination of storage, hydro and gas. In designing such a system there are various trade-offs between transmission and firming costs. Systems built to minimize the total firming requirement will end up with more wind, much of which will be located around the perimeter of the grid, and therefore result in greater transmission requirements. Once transmission costs are allowed for, a lower overall cost solution is to have more solar located closer to demand, and to handle the resulting volatility with extra firming using gas. A feature of a high VRE grid is strong seasonality. Output from solar is lower in winter and wind is also seasonal. When only batteries or pumped hydro are used to deal with wind and solar supply shortfalls our work shows that, for any “reasonable” quantity of storage, it is often empty. This is particularly the case in winter. Our analysis shows that using gas earlier in the merit order during winter resulted in lower requirement for storage capacity while retaining “low” gas consumption. By contrast, using storage early in the supply sequence during spring and summer – when VRE output tends to exceed demand – minimises the use of gas. We note that once again QLD output helps with seasonality droughts, as QLD wind tends to be better in Winter and less in Summer. Sharpe Ratio The Sharpe ratio of a portfolio is inversely proportional to its variability. Average output of the Sharpe ratio-maximised portfolio cannot be increased without incurring more volatility. Practically, we first maximised the stability of the VRE portfolio by increasing its Sharpe ratio. This showed that the highest Sharpe ratio portfolio was dominated by Qld and Tasmania onshore wind, but also included about 19% solar and a small amount of offshore wind. A major limitation of this analysis being the omission of transmission costs. Subsequently we estimate the cost [3] of the system (capital costs, transmission network costs and OPEX) and generate several cost-minimised portfolios, gradually introducing minimum Sharpe ratio constraints. Increasing the minimum Sharpe ratio requirement of the cost-optimizer incentivises widening the geographical distribution of power generation, i.e., more generation near the fringes of the grid. This is intuitive: generally, the greater the distance between two REZ’s the less correlation there is between the weather conditions at the two locations, particularly for wind. This effect is clearly observed in the correlation matrices of the wind and solar capacity factors (Figure 6 and Figure 7). Figure 6: REZ Solar Capacity Factor Correlation Matrix – Ordered by Latitude Figure 7: REZ Wind Capacity Factor Correlation Matrix – Ordered by Latitude In a Sharpe-optimised system, there is a lot of incentive to allocate weight to REZ’s in Northern Queensland (farthest North), Central South Australia (farthest West) and Tasmania (farthest South) as this achieves the widest possible geographic spread of generation. We see this assertion supported in Figure 2. Increasing the Sharpe ratio also incentivises wind – particularly Tas and Qld wind – over solar, again intuitively, because: the power generation of a higher-Sharpe-ratio portfolio would drop less drastically overnight. Solar capacity factors from separate REZ’s have a much stronger correlation with each other than wind capacity factors. Increasing wind in the portfolio therefore has a greater upwards influence on Sharpe ratio than solar. See Table 2. The Sharpe ratio of an evenly weighted solar-only portfolio is about a third of the Sharpe ratio of an evenly weighted wind-only portfolio. Table 2 : Sharpe Ratio for Solar and Wind Only Portfolios Portfolio Sharpe Ratio Solar Only (Evenly Weighted) 0.83 Wind Only (Evenly Weighted) 2.52 Sources: AEMO Draft 2024 ISP As such, as we increase the minimum acceptable Sharpe ratio (model constraint) in our cost minimisation model we observe: More generation at the fringes of the grid, therefore higher onshore transmission cost. VRE portfolio weight more heavily allocated to wind. Lower firming requirements – and therefore lower gas capital and fuel costs – as the more stable portfolio with higher wind meets NEM demand in a greater portion of half-hour periods. This has an exaggerated effect on the system balance through peak demand, and overnight, as solar trails off. Figure 8 illustrates the effect of increasing the Sharpe ratio on the average day power supply by source (i.e., more VRE, less firming). Figure 8: Average Day Supply by Source at Different Sharpe Ratios. Click here to see a higher-resolution version. VRE Portfolio Scale – Effect on Cost As VRE Portfolio capacity relative to NEM demand (“VRE Scale” hereon) increases, system capital cost increases but firming capacity requirements decrease. To minimise long-term costs, VRE portfolio generation should be set to 100-110% of CY2025 demand. See Figure 9, which models the costs of ITK’s preferred portfolio at various values of VRE Scale. The optimal setpoint for this ratio achieves the best trade-off between VRE capital costs and gas fuel costs. Although slightly more costly, 110% VRE Scale was preferred, because it had substantially lower gas requirements than 100%. Figure 9: Effect of “VRE Scale” on System Cost and OPEX Solar % of VRE Portfolio A similar sensitivity analysis was conducted on the Wind / Solar ratio, by varying the relative amount of each within the portfolio (retaining REZ ratios within each generation type). The optimum mix sits at around 18.5% Solar (using Draft ISP 2024 data). The greater the solar, the lower the capital cost, but this comes at the expense of significantly higher firming requirements, and therefore higher long-term cost. Figure 10: Effect of VRE Portfolio % Solar on System Cost and OPEX ITK-Preferred Portfolio ITK prefers a slightly more expensive system (than the absolute minimum cost) with greater transmission requirements but significantly lower reliance on gas. This portfolio minimizes the 25-year total cost of the system with the following additional requirements: a Sharpe ratio ≥0 (set as a constraint in the optimisation model) VRE scaled to generate 110% of NEM total demand in CY2025, and Tas generation surplus to state demand must be transmitted to Victoria, therefore incurs offshore transmission costs. Given the high cost of DC transmission, this constraint renders Tas generation surplus to state demand nonviable. Figure 11: ITK-Preferred VRE Portfolio Supply by Source ITK’s preferred portfolio consists of: 58 GW of VRE supplying 160 TWh in CY2025. 15 GW / 4h of BESS supplying 8 TWh in CY2025. 13 GW of firming gas supplying 5 TWh in CY2025. 5 GW / 14 TWh of Hydro supplying 12 TWh in CY2025. Costs In this note, costs are not intended to be indicative of actual costs but rather are goals set in the optimisation function. Specifically, the optimiser takes no account of existing assets other than hydro. No account is taken of existing gas, existing wind and solar or existing transmission. Equally because the VRE and storage are built on an “overnight” basis, no allowance is made for learning rate impacts which are expected to drive down the costs of solar and batteries, particularly over the next decade. ITK’s personal expectation is that once we get into the transmission building phase of the transition that some improvement in the cost outlook for this component can be achieved. That said the unit costs and weights of three systems that we built are shown in Table 3: Lowest cost portfolio , 25-year total cost minimised, Tas generation constrained [4] ITK’s preferred portfolio , 25-year total cost minimised, Tas generation constrained, VRE portfolio Sharpe Ratio ≥ Sharpe-optimised portfolio . No cost constraint, Sharpe ratio maximised.

Table 4 : Cost Inputs Item Unit Cost ($) Unit Gas Capital 1,200,000 / MW Solar Capital 1,200,000 / MW Onshore Wind Capital 2,500,000 / MW Offshore Wind Capital 4,500,000 / MW Storage Capital 600,000 / MWh Gas Fuel 100 / MWh Storage Dispatch – / MWh Hydro Dispatch 5 / MWh Onshore Transmission 2,000 / MW / km Offshore Transmission 15,000 / MW / km To find the price of electricity required to justify the investment, we ran an NPV analysis and set the price at a level which ensures an internal rate of return (IRR) equal to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). This required all assets, both new and existing, to earn a return on capital and recover all OPEX. A shortcut to this process is to take our capital costs per Table 4, add in a cost of $3m / MW for 7500 MW of existing hydro, and also allow $12 / MWh for wind and $5 / MWh for solar OPEX, solely for this specific levelized cost objective. This analysis yielded the following required electricity prices: Table 5 : Required Electricity Prices for Modelled VRE Systems VRE/Firming System Required Electricity Price Lowest Cost $ 58 / MWh ITK Preferred $ 62 / MWh Sharpe-Optimized $ 70 / MWh From another point of view, one could look at the change in the quantity of gas generation under each of the scenarios, convert that to gas consumption and then calculate the marginal cost of CO 2 abatement as (change in system costs / change in CO 2 ). Conclusion More solar means lower stability and more firming requirements but is cheaper. A cost-minimized system with no other constraints favours solar, closer to demand centres. If the amortisation period is increased, compounding firming gas fuel costs drive the balance towards wind. As we increase Sharpe ratio minimum constraints, we see solar gradually dropped for wind, and long-term gas costs traded off for upfront transmission costs. A Sharpe-maximized (high stability) system more heavily favours wind, particularly at the fringes of the grid, in REZ’s with higher quality renewable energy leading to lower system volatility and firming costs/emissions but higher transmission costs. The high modelled cost of offshore wind means that none of the cost-minimised systems allocate weight to offshore wind REZ’s. ITK’s preference is a highly interconnected, wind-heavy, stable, and low-carbon NEM. Practically this is achieved by generating a 25-year cost-minimized portfolio with a minimum Sharpe ratio requirement. Limitations Round-trip efficiency losses are ignored. The transmission system modelled is rudimentary. Further work could model the transmission network and associated costs more accurately and ensure that demand at each of the sub-regional demand centres was appropriately met. Firming dispatch order is (essentially) fixed, aside from a simple order change in summer/spring vs. winter/autumn. Future work could model a dynamic dispatch order. Battery and hydro capacity were fixed. Both the power and hours available components of storage and hydro could be optimized in further simulations. System costs are rudimentary and do not include rooftop, which is taken as a “free good”. [1] The optimiser is programmed to generate the lowest cost portfolio over 10, 15, 20 and 25 years respectively. The cost breakdown indicated is the 25-year total system cost for each of these portfolios. [2] Demand values shown below the x-axis (negative) [3] In this note costs are not intended to be indicative of actual costs but rather goals set in the optimisation function [4] Tas generation above state demand incurs offshore transmission costs, as it must be transmitted to Victoria.

    "title": "What was the cause of the coincident trip of Eraring units 1 and 2?",
    "date": "08-04-2024 11:22:00 AM",
    "content": "At approximately 13:22 ( NEM time ) on Wednesday 3rd April 2024 we saw ‘Simultaneous trip of ER01 and ER02 drops mainland frequency in the NEM’ . There were several articles that followed, which were collated here – including Linton’s note that the units returned on Wednesday night 3rd April . Linton’s article noted AEMO’s MN115497, in which was noted: ‘The cause of this non-credible contingency event has been identified and AEMO is satisfied that another occurrence of this event is unlikely under the current circumstances.’ However I wondered if I could find out, more specifically, what the cause was… Anything in the bids & rebids?

    "title": "Supply-side responses following the trip of two Eraring units on Wednesday 3 April 2024",
    "date": "05-04-2024 08:59:00 AM",
    "content": "How did the supply side respond in the energy market after the Trip of two Eraring units on Wednesday 3 April 2024 ? We inspect the bidding and dispatch outcomes of key units by fuel type to capture the main energy-focused contributions. The non-credible event (the trip of Eraring Unit 1 and 2) occurred within the 13:25 dispatch interval. For a deeper dive on the event itself, the four intervals straddling this time period were reviewed on the day in Replaying four dispatch intervals on Wed 3rd April 2024 with the ER01 and ER02 trip (Part 2) . To recap, the following screenshot from ez2view shows: A drop of about 1000 MW in the 13:25 dispatch interval, as Unit 1 and Unit 2 tripped. The station’s bids had not changed for the 13:30 interval. The 13:30 interval’s energy price was only a little over 140 $/MWh. There was one later spike to 268 $/MWh in the 14:40 interval. Reduced availability (the step change in the chart) of Eraring’s Unit 1 and Unit 2, via rebids to account for the outage, was first reflected in dispatch in the 13:35 dispatch interval. Eraring’s collective output did increase after the trip – Unit 3 remained operational and increased supply. To view how other NSW units responded, I’ve taken a “by fuel-type” approach, and identified the following. Gas units At 13:28, two minutes after Eraring’s rebids were submitted (which was at 13:26), Uranquinty rebid units URANQ11 and URANQ12. The effect was to move a collective 305 MW priced at market cap to down to the market floor price (-1000 $/MWh). It was URANQ11 that began its ramp up from the 13:40 interval, eventually to its maximum availability level. This was noted by Paul in Replaying four dispatch intervals on Wed 3rd April 2024 with the ER01 and ER02 trip (Part 2) . Although rebid at the same time, URANQ12 received its first non-zero target for the 13:45 dispatch interval, believed to be in line with its fast start profile which required 11 minutes to synchronise. A later increase in station output, from interval 14 :35, included output from URANQ13 and URANQ14 while URANQ11 and URANQ12 received reduced dispatch targets (seen in the above chart). The collective effect was an increase in station output until 14:50. Coal units At 13:28 (effective for 13:35) Vales Point units 5 & 6 were rebid to double their upwards rates of change (from 3 MW/min to 6 MW/min, as bid). This appears to have helped the units achieve higher dispatch targets sooner. 729 MW priced between 0 – and 88 $/MWh was progressively dispatched to 14:50 and the increase was generally in line with ramp rates. A minute after the Vales point rebids, ER03 (the one that did not trip) was rebid (effective 13:35) to set all availability at -1000 $/MWh. This led it to receive targets in line with its upwards ramp rate of 5 MW/min (bid), eventually increasing output +350 MW by 15:00. Hydro units Prices appeared to remain too low for much of the hydro fleet to contribute energy in the absence of the two Eraring units. The following chart shows that much of the energy capacity was offered higher that $150 per MWh. The highest aggregate level of output was seen at 13:30 when 175 MW from hydro resources was dispatched. A small amount relative to available capacity. Soon afterwards, for the 13:40 interval UPPTUMUT rebid with explanation “manage small uneconomical marginal targets” to effectively ensure at least 40 MW was dispatched for a brief period (20 minutes). A small increase in output at HUMENSW was also noted yet this appears attributable to increased availability following updated water authority releases, rather than in direct response to price conditions caused by the trip event. Battery storage units There was little energy contribution from battery storage. As with the hydro sector, prices appear to have remained too low for large volumes to be dispatched in the energy market. The Queanbeyean battery (QBYNBG1) was the primary contributor to energy output. Darlington Point (DPNTBG1) and Riverina 2 BESS (RIVNBG2) often saw output in the absence of energy targets suggesting these units were likely utilised in FCAS. At the time of writing We’re pleased to observe that Eraring Unit 1 and Unit 2 both appear to be operating as per usual since early morning on the 4th April 2024 (to present, 08:30 on the 5th), following the successful and (apparently) event-free the return to regular service that began Wednesday evening (3 April, 2024).",

Time-Travelling one of my ez2view windows back to earlier today, we can quickly see a broader view of what was happening in the NSW region at the time: 13:20 dispatch interval … prior to the trip Here’s the snapshot of the 13:20 dispatch interval… remembering the NEM works on an ‘end of interval’ basis, and that (in time-travel) all output measures revert to FinalMW (i.e. SCADA snapshots at the end of the interval): Note that: 1) there are 3 x Eraring units running (ER01, ER02 and ER03) 2) … with ER04 offline on an unplanned outage, which we see in the ‘Generator Outages’ widget (but not shown here) 3) Aggregate output at the 13:20 time point being 1,358MW (i.e. aggregate FinalMW). 13:25 dispatch interval … ‘bridging’ the trip In this snapshot for the 13:25 dispatch interval we now know that we’re straddling the trip , in that: 1) Output values are SCADA snapshots from 13:25, so show the physical effect of the trip; but 2) Target values (e.g. for price, demand and interconnector flow) reflect AEMO’s expectations in the SCADA run at 13:20 … and so before the trip occurred Keeping this in mind: As alluded two above: 1) Three widgets shown here (the NSW Schematic, the Notifications and the GenChange widget) all reflect the change in FinalMW for ER01 and ER02 (a) interestingly, the third unit (ER03) stays online (b) we presume this is related to a separation between how Units 1 & 2 (on 330kV) and Units 3 & 4 (on 500kV) connect into the NEM: network diagram from AEMO, supplied with their permission in the ‘Station Details’ widget in ez2view. 2) But this change has yet to filter through to dispatch outcomes – so: (a) No significant change in prices (b) No significant change in target for flow, etc… 13:30 dispatch interval … first NEMDE run taking account of the trip Five minutes later, this is what we see: From a NEMDE run point of view: 1) AEMO knows that the output of ER01 and ER02 are zero (because they come automatically from SCADA snapshot): (a) so prices and target flows on interconnectors have adjusted to take account of the gap to be filled from generation from elsewhere. (b) but it does not yet know the availability of ER01 and ER02 are zero … 2) … because there’s no rebid yet received from Origin for the two units (a) perfectly understandable , as … i. The trip happened between 13:20 and 13:25 ii. ‘Gate Closure’ for rebids for the 13:30 dispatch interval would be ~13:24:40 or so iii. Hence insufficient time to submit! (b) so the aggregate Available Generation for NSW has not dropped. 13:35 dispatch interval … second NEMDE run taking account of the trip Five minutes later, this is what we see: We deduce that Origin has submitted a rebid for a few different units before the 13:30 ‘gate closure’ for this dispatch interval, because we see: 1) Available Generation for NSW dropping by ~1,000MW … which would be because ER01 and ER02 have had MaxAvail set to 0MW in their rebids; 2) Additionally, we see URAN11 starting up. … this unit’s normally bid up towards the Market Price Cap , except if Origin wants it to run, as we see in the pattern for the last 7 days in the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view (and remembering that the bids data is only ‘next day public’: That’s all for now…",

    "date": "01-04-2024 06:35:00 PM",
    "content": "It’s Monday 1st April 2024, so we’re now just under 7 weeks under the ’Major Power System Event’ of 13th February 2024 , triggered by some wild weather that included (bushfires leading to the unexpected shutdown of a large wind farm as a preamble before) strong winds destroyed 6 transmission towers (prompting some questions and) , leading to some significant load shedding. But there’s still plenty of questions left to explore, as time permits – including: 1) On 14th February (i.e. next day) we posted Some Initial Questions in the article ‘Some *initial* headline questions following the transmission damage, unit trips & loss of load, initiated on Tuesday 13th February 2024’ here. 2) There were 27 Observations/Questions about on-the-day events in the article ‘A quick first pass through ENERGY bids (for Victorian units) on Tuesday 13th Feb 2024’ on 17th February. 3) There were also 28 x Observation/Questions about on-the-day events in the article ‘From the 4-second SCADA data, a view of Production by Fuel Type on Tuesday 13th February 2024’ , published on 18th February. 4) Plus there have been others occur to us in other ways as well … including via suggestions from readers. Taking another step towards answering some of these questions, today we’ll take a look at how aggregate exports from Victoria changed with the events that occurred on that day… again using the 4-second data: Net exports (or imports) from Victoria Let’s start with the 14-hour sample of AEMO’s 4-second data that we initially saw in Allan’s early observations , and then: 1) In this ‘14 hours of trended (mainland) frequency on Tuesday 13th February 2024’ ; and then 2) In the article ‘From the 4-second SCADA data, a view of Production by Fuel Type on Tuesday 13th February 2024’ , published on 18th February … which then led into deeper dives into several assets including: (a) Stockyard Hill Wind Farm ; and (b) Moorabool Wind Farm ; and (c) Berrybank Wind Farm ; and (d) Most recently, the Victoria Big Battery . … there are obviously many more assets to look at. However in this article we’ll take a different approach, by looking (in aggregate) at net electricity exports from Victoria through this 14 hour window (or imports being negative): Keep in mind that VIC is interconnected with TAS (via Basslink) and SA (via Heywood and Murraylink) and NSW (via VIC1-NSW1 ). So the trend above is the aggregate of the flows, remembering that dispatch is such that a region can be importing at one end and exporting at the other end . It’s clear to see that: 1) At the start and end of the chart VIC was a net energy exporter … which is not a surprise for those who have been reading the quarterly summaries of inter-regional interchanges in Appendix 6 of GenInsights Quarterly Updates (one of two regions that consistently are net exporters in aggregate ). 2) But VIC quickly became an energy importer from ~13:00 to ~17:00 NEM time … … with a rapid ramp up on imports at the time of the transmission tower failure that started Event 2 . So we zoom in and take a closer look at the half hour period 13:00 to 13:30 … In this case we see a few interesting things: 1) In the first ~minute following the destruction of that transmission flow path, Victoria rapidly ramped up net exports … though this was short-lived. 2) In conjunction with the large loss of generation from Loy Yang A station, flows rapidly reversed and VIC became a large importer within seconds . (a) remembering that the 4-second data has some peculiarities about timestamps, we can’t be absolutely sure on the exact timing, other than to say that flows swung around very quickly after (or in line with) the drop in frequency as Loy Yang A fell offline. (b) seems likely that this rapid ramp was as a result of out-of-Victoria Primary Frequency Response ( PFR ) : … in a later article we might look more closely at where this came from (e.g. location, and which types of plants). 3) I’ve noted on this chart that there’s a ~750MW gap between the 2,200MW of supply lost from Loy Yang A … (a) actually it’s a larger gap, given the ~2,450MW loss of supply from Dundonnell and Loy Yang A) and the ~1,500MW gained from rapid imports. (b) this gap roughly matches the ~950MW load initially ‘shaken off’ in the disruption. 4) Over the ~10 minutes from 13:10 onwards, net imports increased by ~750MW … potentially in conjunction with some of that load initially ‘shaken off’ being reconnected. Interconnector flows With the above in mind, let’s look at the four Victorian-connected interconnectors (i.e. omitting QNI and Directlink to make the chart less busy): In the 14-hour window above, it should be evident from the display that metered flows on the two AC-interconnectors are much more volatile than the metered flows on the two DC-interconnectors (Directlink and Murraylink). … that’s because the AC interconnectors are not ‘controlled’ in the same way the DC interconnectors are. Remember also that these interconnectors have a number sign that can be thought of as ‘Hobart centric’: 1) Flow away from Hobart (to the north, and the west) is positive ; whilst 2) Flow towards Hobart (to the south, and the east) is negative . Zooming into the 30-minute period at the start of Event 2 (i.e. 13:00 to 13:30) we see the following: So in this case we see that the response of the interconnectors is as follows: 1) For the VIC1-NSW1 interconnector, the variation is the largest (which is in line with its overall size): (a) Immediately after the towers are downed, the flow increases towards NSW, but that is shortlived; (b) With Loy Yang A rapidly coming offline, the flow switches to import up to 1000MW by the 13:10 mark. 2) For the Heywood (i.e. VIC1-SA1) interconnector, the pattern is somewhat similar: (a) Immediately after the towers are downed … i. the flow can be shown as jumping upwards on the chart. ii. but (because it was below 0MW beforehand) means a reduced flow from SA into VIC; (b) With Loy Yang A rapidly coming offline, the pattern is more clearly: i. A gentler decline (i.e. importing more from SA)); ii. Before a rapid drop at ~13:10. 3) For the Basslink interconnector, this does not really visibly change (at this scale) until ~13:00 4) Seeing Murraylink on the same chart, as a smaller size interconnector any change is more difficult to see, but it appears that: (a) It was exporting (VIC to SA) at the time of the trip; and (b) Took about 10 minutes (to ~13:20) to ramp down to about 0MW. That’s all for now…",

    "date": "28-03-2024 08:00:00 PM",
    "content": "This is a belated, and back-dated article to help include more context for later articles. On 28 March 2024, the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) made a final determination and more preferable final rule to improve market arrangements for security services in response to rule change requests from Hydro Tasmania and Delta Electricity. On the day, the AEMC published the Media Release ‘Final rule to improve security frameworks for the energy market transition’ which said (with our emphasis added): ‘The rule, shaped by extensive stakeholder feedback, builds upon existing tools in the power system to enhance system security procurement frameworks. It responds to two rule change requests from Hydro Tasmania and Delta Electricity. As the energy market transitions, ensuring system security becomes increasingly complex . While every day brings new information about how best to operate a future system with more inverter-based resources, the capabilities of emerging technologies are still being tested and understood and synchronous plant continues to retire. As a result, there may be periods of scarcity in essential system services .’ … and … ‘The rule proactively facilitates a secure power system transition by enhancing procurement frameworks to reduce reliance on directions and drive investments in new technologies. It will also improve cost recovery arrangements for Transmission Network Service Providers’ (TNSP) non-network security contracts to promote efficiency and minimise price volatility for customers. Further, the rule will increase transparency on current system security needs and understanding, and how the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) plans to manage system security during the transition to a net-zero emissions power system. The Commission has also introduced a new non-market ancillary service (NMAS) framework for transitional services , allowing AEMO to procure two new types of services to assist the transition to a secure net-zero power system. Under the rule, a new annual reporting requirement known as the ‘transition plan for system security’ will be implemented, It requires AEMO to report on the steps it will take to manage system security through the transition. Additionally, the final rule aims to improve real-time market notices and post-event directions reporting , providing more transparency to stakeholders.’ There’s more information about this Rule Change, and the preceding process, on the AEMC sub-site under ERC0290 here . This includes the 163-page final determination : Key Dates The enablement of security services under the ISF Rule commences 2 December 2025 and must be conducted in accordance with the Security Enablement Procedures that are to be published by 31 August 2025 .",

    "title": "Case Study of inertia supplied by source in the NSW grid on Tuesday 14th November 2023",
    "date": "28-03-2024 05:54:00 PM",
    "content": "Back on Monday 13th November 2023 we wrote about ‘Forecast low System Strength of concern in NSW for Tuesday 14th November 2023 … first time ever?’ . We confirmed with AEMO later that this was indeed the first time ever for this type of concern in NSW … but a sign of what’s to come as coal units continue to exit the NEM (with the potential closure of Eraring in under 18 months the next cab off the rank). This day was one of 92 days in Q4 2023, and so was covered in some detail in the recently released GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q4 . In particular, in Appendix 1 within this report, along with other Heatbeat Indicators, we track the level of Inertia in all regions of the grid. … it was on 20th July 2023 that Jon Dyson wrote ‘Let’s talk about inertia’ , and this is one way in which we* are helping to facilitate that conversation. * noting again that this was a collaborative effort between some of us at Global-Roam Pty Ltd (the producers of WattClarity) and the analytical team at Greenview Strategic Consulting . Level of inertia in the NSW grid on Tue 14th November 2023 So with concerns flagged by AEMO about low level of System Strength in the NSW grid leading into that day, let’s take a look at what actually unfolded on the day (with data extracted from the recently released GenInsights 2023 Q4 ): Starting simple, on this chart are 4 trends through the day, all to do with Inertia in the NSW region of the NEM: 1) There’s two trends (black and grey) for the ‘actual’ level of inertia: (a) The black line shows the AEMO’s calculated level, which they have been publishing for a number of months now (Jon’s article spoke about this). (b) The grey line shows a bottom-up calculation that is performed for the recently released GenInsights 2023 Q4 to calculate based on the units in service, and their inertia parameters. 2) There’s also two alert-colour trends from the AEMO, being their ‘Secure’ and ‘Minimum’ threshold levels that they aim to steer the grid to stay above (because if they fell under, the AEMO and TNSP modelling shows the grid would be much less stable in the event of an interconnector trip or other such disruption). Hence in this chart through the day, we see that at all points it’s above the AEMO’s ‘Secure’ level (which is what we want to see), and that it drops to its lowest level at 09:05, remaining there for a little over an hour. The timing of minimum inertia is not a surprise in an environment where rooftop PV is eating away at grid demand , and hence supply from large scheduled units that are supplying inertia ‘free’ as a bundled part of the energy they supply. Lowest point, from 09:05 on Tue 14th November 2024 Opening up ez2view at the 09:05 dispatch interval ( NEM time ) on Tue 14th November 2023, we use the ‘NEM Map’ and ‘NSW Schematic’ widgets to have a look at what was happening across the NEM, and particularly in the NSW region, at this point in time: We see that: 1) the level of inertia in the NSW region was 13,191 MW.s (remember that inertia is measured in ‘megawatt-seconds’). 2) we also see that, of the coal units: (a) Bayswater has three units running; (b) Eraring has two units running; (c) Mt Piper has one unit running; and (d) Vales Point has one unit running. In order to understand more about what was offline and why on the day, I opened the ‘Generator Outages’ widget from ez2view at the same time-travelled point in time (i.e. the 09:05 dispatch interval NEM time on Tue 14th November 2023), and filtered down to ‘big NSW units’ using this filter: … and here’s the view: Of the units that are offline, then, we see that: 1) Bayswater 1 was off for a Planned Outage. 2) Eraring 1 was off for a Forced Outage … planned to come back in the next day or so. 3) Eraring 2 was off for a Planned Outage. 4) Mt Piper 2 was off for a Planned Outage. 5) Vales Point 5 was of for a Forced Outage. With this in mind, let’s move on further… Contributions from the plant mix in NSW In this chart we’ve added in the calculated level of contribution from all the units operational in NSW through the day: It’s clear to see that: 1) the coal units (operating through the day, except for one unit coming off around 21:00 that day) were supplying the bulk of the inertia, particularly during the low demand periods in the middle of the day; 2) Gas generators supplied most of the additional inertia required for the evening peak What would the effect have been, without Eraring on the day? It’s logical to wonder, then, what the effect on inertia would have been had the two Eraring units not been present through the day … so subtracting their contribution, this is what we see: Clearly the aggregate contribution level (dotted grey line) is now much closer to the AEMO’s ‘Secure’ threshold during the middle of the day. Keep in mind that the energy not supplied by the two Eraring units would need to be supplied by something else in this hypothetical case study … Question 1) what if we removed these 2 x Eraring units? As the second last piece in this article, it’s worth readers thinking through what the inertia contribution would have been from the replacement capacity being touted as the means to allow for the retirement of Eraring in under 18 months time? How many of these modelling exercises that purport to show that we can safely close Eraring even give some consideration to this ‘keeping the lights on service’ ? Question 2) what if we removed all 4 x Eraring units? Now assume that all four Eraring units were running through this period (and perhaps other coal units at Bayswater, Mt Piper and Vales Point were off on outage). It should be obvious that the Eraring station would be supplying even more (in percentage terms) of the inertia that the NSW grid relies upon to continue being a stable platform to support an essential service, and a highly capital intensive and volatile energy market. What would the situation have been then if they were to be removed, and where would the replacement inertia be supplied from? The reason for these questions is not to throw up barriers to the energy transition . It’s clear to us that one of the biggest threats to the energy transition is simplistic thinking and a ‘she’ll be right mate’ attitude that is likely to come a cropper at that point – leading to a political backlash that will put the transition back a decade or more. We all* need to do better … * ourselves at Global-Roam Pty Ltd included … which is why we’re relentlessly trying to be better each day than how we were the day before.",

    "date": "28-03-2024 05:19:00 PM",
    "content": "A short note for our WattClarity readers just prior to Easter to highlight that Ashleigh Lange has published the article ‘Wind farms facing potential cut outs’ earlier today: The full article is well worth reading (for our readers here), but the key point appears to be: ‘ Late Monday into Tuesday , there are early indications that damaging wind gusts could impact parts of Vic, Tas, NSW and the ACT . These winds could exceed the criteria of 90km/h forcing some wind farms to turn the propellers off and reducing the capacity. There is still some uncertainty in the strength and location of these damaging winds, due to varying positions of the low.’ Out of curiosity, I opened up the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view and looked at AEMO’s projections of NEM-wide Wind Farm UIGF out in the ST PASA time horizon: Remember this widget allows one to ‘ look up a vertical ’ to see ‘that other dimension of time’ . What’s clear in this view are two things: 1) Out in the ST PASA time horizon, it’s Tuesday afternoon (2nd April 2024) where the forecast for aggregate wind production (or at least, the energy-constrained capability) will be at its highest in this time range; 2) But that, at only ~4,400MW at the highest point, it’s only just over half of the all-time maximum point (at 8,132MW set in July 2023). So whilst: (a) it might be high wind speeds in some locations (giving a chance of high wind cut-out on some wind farms) (b) it won’t be spread across a large enough area to deliver high wind production, in aggregate Stay tuned to see what actually happens?!",

    "title": "Missing megawatts and phantom generation",
    "date": "28-03-2024 04:35:00 PM",
    "content": "In this post I’ll try to unpack AEMO’s slightly cryptic announcement of a Scheduling Error (Incident 60) which resulted in underestimation of NSW operational demand from 24 January to 7 March this year. Paul’s initial post contained AEMO’s description of the event, repeated here: ‘From 0850 hrs on 24/01/2024 to 1845 hrs on 07/03/2024 , an error in the Energy Management System (EMS) NSW generator calculation resulted in an underestimation of NSW operational demand and an under-dispatch of generators across the NEM, equivalent to the generation target of Tallawarra B (up to 320 MW). From 1845 hrs on 07/03/2024 to 1920 hrs on 07/03/2024 , a temporary fix corrected the NSW operational demand calculation, but incorrectly dispatched Tallawarra A when it was out of service, resulting in under-dispatch of the remaining NEM generation by approximately 275 MW. The errors resulted in under-dispatch of 146 MW on average for approximately 100 hours .’ What does this mean in ordinary English? To decode it, we have to start by detouring yet again through how electricity demand is measured in practice. Demand = Supply At wholesale market or grid level, electricity demand is defined in terms of supply. The grid doesn’t store electric power, just transmits it from point to point at light speed, so what goes out of the grid every millisecond ( demand ) must equal what goes in ( supply ). Because supply comes from a relatively small number of very large sources, namely generators (and if we’re measuring at regional level, interconnectors), it’s more convenient to measure demand from the supply end. Without getting into its many arcane variants , we can therefore say that in the NEM: Demand = Sum(Generator outputs) +/- net interconnector transfers This is exactly how AEMO measures actual live demand on the grid, with the proviso that this measurement is limited to generators which provide real-time SCADA feeds of their instantaneous power output. SCADA = “Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition” and is a generic term for interchange of real-time measurement and control information across all sorts of industrial processes. In the NEM, SCADA systems allow AEMO, network operators, and individual generators to exchange a wide range of information on the state of the grid, comprising thousands of individual measurement and control signals, including real-time generator outputs, typically at four-second intervals. This covers the vast majority of the grid’s supply sources, with the notable exception of the millions of rooftop solar PV systems supplying about 10-12% of the energy consumed across the NEM. AEMO’s demand measures exclude this contribution (and those from a few pretty small “embedded” generators connected into local distribution networks, usually smaller than 5 MW), meaning that AEMO’s metrics encompass the demand met from large-scale sources only. Of course it’s possible to estimate the supply from rooftop PV using data on the location and capacity of installed systems (provided by the Clean Energy Regulator’s database ) and various sampling approaches . This allows more comprehensive estimates of overall consumption, such as “Underlying Demand”, to be made. But for most purposes and certainly for real time power system management, the narrower SCADA-based grid demand measures are most relevant. Market Demand and Supply In running the NEM’s wholesale spot market, AEMO’s task is to schedule market supply into the grid so that it balances demand. But what measure of demand? Since only large market-scheduled generators (and a few “scheduled loads”) are dispatched via the spot market, the appropriate demand metric for balancing the wholesale market, or at least the appropriate starting point, is: whatever all those large market-scheduled generators and loads are producing / consuming right now . Factoring in interconnectors as well, this gets us back to something very close to my initial demand definition: Market Demand (measured) = Sum(Market Generator Production) – Sum(Scheduled Load Consumption) +/- Net interconnector transfers All the information needed for this measure is available from real-time SCADA feeds, since a condition of being a market generator or scheduled load is being SCADA-connected to AEMO. AEMO can measure market demand for each NEM region every four seconds via SCADA, but the market scheduling process runs at five-minute intervals, and therefore starts with a demand snapshot constructed just before the start of every dispatch run by adding up all the latest SCADA measurements from generators, loads and interconnecting transmission lines. This measurement is labelled INITIALSUPPLY in AEMO’s dispatch datasets. Anyone who is really keen can reconcile this measure to the individual values for the generators/loads and interconnectors relevant to each NEM region (labelled INITIALMW and METEREDMWFLOW respectively). In scheduling the market for the following dispatch interval, AEMO makes a few adjustments to INITIALSUPPLY – principally by adding a forecast for the expected change in demand over the next five minutes – ending up with a market scheduling input called TOTALDEMAND . (a) Except that it’s not really “total demand” in ordinary parlance, since it excludes rooftop PV and non-market supplies, includes a forecast component, nets off the consumption of scheduled loads, and has a few other wrinkles – but it is the appropriate number for scheduling purposes). (b) The team at Global-Roam have taken to referring to this (i.e. TOTALDEMAND ) as ‘Market Demand’ , as it’s the starting point for determining the dispatch outcomes and prices in the market. But that’s not an official term used by the AEMO. Missing megawatts Now we’re ready to decode AEMO’s Scheduling Error. Suppose a new large-scale, market scheduled generator comes onto the grid, having gone through all the relevant registration, connection, and testing protocols, and starts bidding and operating in the market. But what if a configuration oversight somewhere in AEMO’s systems means that new generator’s SCADA output isn’t being included in the demand snapshot that feeds market scheduling via the INITIALSUPPLY measure? Obviously, the first consequence is that AEMO’s measure of market demand will be too low, by whatever quantum of output the “overlooked” generator is physically producing. Suppose that all the relevant SCADA feeds add up to 1,000 MW, with the overlooked unit producing 100 MW of that total. That 1,000 MW is the appropriate physical measure of market demand. But the bookkeeping oversight means that AEMO’s systems miss that 100 MW, and record market demand of only 900 MW. Let’s assume nothing is forecast to change over the next dispatch interval, and that the overlooked generator is again dispatched to supply 100 MW. This means that all the other contributions to market supply – generation, load and transfers – will be scheduled to produce a net 800 MW . If physical demand remains at 1,000 MW, these scheduled supplies will be insufficient to the tune of the 100 MW missing from AEMO’s demand measure. This doesn’t mean the lights will go out . If input to the grid doesn’t keep pace with demand, grid frequency immediately starts drifting downwards (physically, the extra power needed comes from large synchronous generators’ kinetic energy of rotation being converted to electrical energy as they slow down). In response to falling frequency the real-time frequency control measures embedded in operation of the grid – in particular Regulation FCAS and primary frequency response will then operate to increase supply and keep things in balance. The effect of these responses is that, in total, generation and power transfers scheduled to supply only a net 800 MW will in fact correct to supply the 900 MW physically required. At this point, someone may ask how the new generator could be bidding and getting scheduled at all if its SCADA-measured output isn’t being included in AEMO’s demand measurements? The answer is that the processes of market scheduling and demand measurement are quite separate, although obviously linked. Demand measurements are calculated by AEMO’s operational Energy Management System (EMS) and fed – along with lots of other stuff – to the NEMDE market optimisation software that schedules the spot market. An oversight in the EMS’s demand calculation isn’t visible to NEMDE nor does it stop it doing its job. It just gives NEMDE an incorrect scheduling target to work with. At the start of the next dispatch interval, the 900 MW being physically produced / transferred by the non-overlooked sources will again be measured as “market demand”, and if the overlooked generator were again scheduled for 100 MW, everything else would again be scheduled for 800 MW – rinse and repeat. Now, since the “missing megawatts” in AEMO’s market demand calculation will still get physically produced somewhere, thanks to the wonders of frequency control, what’s the issue? There are several: The sources that supply the extra 100 MW in our example – via frequency control actions – won’t be the same as those which would have been scheduled if the market demand number had been correct. Some generators will have missed out on producing energy because their scheduled targets were lower than they should have been. Market prices will be affected – all other things being equal, lower market demand means lower market prices. Correcting for configuration errors that affect market scheduling isn’t what frequency control is there for – it’s meant to deal with real events and changes that impact the power system, not bookkeeping problems. Tallawarra B Obviously that last section isn’t purely hypothetical – it’s describing the essentials of what happened with the commissioning of the new Tallawarra B gas-fired unit, which began on 24 January this year. In this commissioning period Tallawarra B operated only intermittently. However AEMO’s notification indicates that any output Tallawarra B did produce wasn’t being added into AEMO’s measurement of NSW demand. But the infrequent running of the unit and its relatively small output (only a couple of percent of typical NSW demand when online) meant that the impact of this oversight was far from obvious. Who knew? Only people looking very closely at system frequency behaviour or usage of frequency control services like Regulation FCAS might have noticed something a bit odd going on when Tallawarra B was running. My guess is that AEMO’s operational team eventually picked this up, leading to investigations and then declaration of the scheduling error. From the outside, the basic market data shows no obvious clues. Since the error in demand was only there if Tallawarra B was running, and directly proportional to the magnitude of its output, one idea might be to look for changes in NSW measured demand in dispatch intervals when Tallawarra B ramped up from zero output, or ramped down to zero at the end of a run. This might show demand apparently decreasing as Tallawarra B ramped up, or increasing at the end of a run. Here’s a plot of Tallawarra B output, NSW INITIALSUPPLY, and changes in each at dispatch interval granularity. You’d be hard pressed to pick anything up from that, given the amount of “noise” in five-minute demand variation due to normal causes (such as real changes in demand 😉). By squinting hard – at 16 February for example – some anti-correlation is apparent, but only in hindsight and certainly with no statistical significance: Fixed – well, not quite: phantom generation Once picked up, it would have been a straightforward fix to correct the bookkeeping issue and add Tallawarra B output into EMS measurement of NSW demand – one would think. But apparently AEMO’s first attempt was NQR – as explained in these terms: “From 1845 hrs on 07/03/2024 to 1920 hrs on 07/03/2024, a temporary fix corrected the NSW operational demand calculation, but incorrectly dispatched Tallawarra A when it was out of service , resulting in under-dispatch of the remaining NEM generation by approximately 275 MW” This is somewhat cryptic and took a while to unpick: how could fixing the Tallawarra B issue lead to Tallawarra A – which wasn’t online and therefore couldn’t physically produce any output at all over the period AEMO specified – being “incorrectly dispatched”?? Here’s what the market data covering this period shows, summarised in ez2view’s Station Details widget for Tallawarra (A and B combined): This shows an apparent output lift for the station from 316 MW (all Tallawarra B) at the beginning of the 18:50 dispatch interval (so measured just before 18:45, since dispatch intervals are labelled by their end time, and INITIALMW values are captured just before the start of the interval), to 630 MW five minutes later. Drilling into the underlying unit-level data shows that the source of this additional output was Tallawarra A’s INITIALMW value jumping from 0 MW to 315 MW , despite the unit being offline and having offered zero availability throughout this particular day. This was clearly not a genuine physical output reading from the offline Tallawarra A unit. What seems to have happened is a replication of Tallawarra B SCADA readings into the SCADA stream for Tallawarra A . Probably not the fix AEMO would have hoped for. Although we can see that at least there is a lift in measured NSW demand of about the right amount: Why not twice the right amount though?? – if Tallawarra B output was now being added into NSW demand for the first time, and Tallawarra A output, already included in that measure, apparently increased by 315 MW, why didn’t measured demand lift by around 630 MW ?? That remains slightly mysterious, not fully covered by AEMO’s notification. The “phantom megawatts” from Tallawarra A continued to appear for another seven dispatch intervals – during which time AEMO presumably fielded some quizzical phone calls from Tallawarra’s operators. A side-effect of these phantom SCADA readings for Tallawarra A is that NEMDE then dutifully scheduled that unit to ramp its (non-existent) output down at its maximum downward ramp rate, specified in Tallawarra A’s standing bids as 8 MW per minute, or 40 MW per dispatch interval. Even if a unit has offered zero availability, if it is (apparently) producing physical output at the start of a dispatch interval, NEMDE by design will not schedule the unit to ramp down any faster than allowed by its ramp rate offer. So from 315 MW of phantom output at interval start, NEMDE instructed Tallawarra A to ramp down to 275 MW. But at the start of the next dispatch interval, apparent output from Tallawarra A was still 315 MW (again replicated from Tallawarra B SCADA) – rinse and repeat once more. The side-effect of this side-effect is that the megawatts which NEMDE “thought” were being produced by Tallawarra A were not being scheduled from other generators actually online and available to produce them. So once again, the market would have ended up under-dispatched, with more work for frequency control mechanisms – and no doubt more stress for AEMO, who were fortunately able to correct this second glitch a lot more quickly than was the case for the original Tallawarra B oversight. ================================================================================================= About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

In the Bids Table below that we see (in amongst all of the automatically generated and formatted rebids) a bid that stands out as manually submitted: It was submitted at 15:54:30 ( NEM time ) First used for the 16:00 dispatch interval (i.e. which is run at ~15:55, so the rebid just scraped in before ‘gate closure’) Speaks about ‘Unexpected/plant limits~Disconnection from Switchyard’ in the rebid reason. Comparing the preceding bid in the ‘Bids Comparison’ function in the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget we can see the capacity was withdrawn for a number of hours as a result of the switchyard fire .",

    "content": "A short note on Wednesday evening 27th March 2024 to highlight this update via Twitter from 7News Adelaide : There’s a bit of detail in the videos above. Opening ez2view and looking at both the legacy station and the new battery, we see that: 1) There’s still a gas-fired unit running at the old station; but 2) The battery’s not been running since ~16:00 NEM time (either charge or discharge). This might be for various reasons (i.e. independent of the fire).

    "title": "GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q4 released",
    "date": "26-03-2024 09:01:00 AM",
    "content": "A belated note this quarter that we’ve* finalised GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q4 , provided subscribers access to the report, and delivered the Executive Briefing required for one of our clients: * noting again that this was a collaborative effort between some of us at Global-Roam Pty Ltd (the producers of WattClarity) and the analytical team at Greenview Strategic Consulting . This is now the seventh in the series of quarterly updates, and follows: 1) We first published the 2022 Q2 Update (132 pages); 2) Then the 2022 Q3 Update (204 pages) , including an additional Appendix for ‘ One Year on from 5MS ‘ 3) Then the 2022 Q4 update … which was released on 14th February 2023 (198 pages) 4) Then the 2023 Q1 update … which was released on 31st May 2023 (258 pages). 5) Then the 2023 Q2 update … which we released on 24th Aug 2023 (now up to 272 pages). 6) Then the 2023 Q3 update … which we delivered in Dec 2023 (now up to 282 pages). 7) Which brings us to this 2023 Q4 update (now up to 304 pages). These quarterly updates seek to update and extend some of the analysis published in our widely-read GenInsights21 publication, which built on the popular GRC2018 (which was released on 31st May 2019 ). (A) What’s in GenInsights 2023 Q4? Here’s a quick view of the content: This report (supplied to subscribers as an integrated PDF) at the following address: https://downloads.wattclarity.com.au/#/ The report contains: (1) An Executive Summary including 6 Key Observations ; and (2) Six appendices which each explore different aspects of the energy transition through the detailed analysis of historical data. These 7 components are explained more below: . About this Component Executive Summary + Chronological Summary 28 pages (a new feature in this Quarterly Update) The Main Report is double the size in 2023 Q4 than for 2023 Q3, because it now includes both: 1) An Executive Summary includes 6 x Key Observations that have been gleaned from what has been observed through the evolution of the focussed quarter. These Key Observations follow in the vein of: (a) the 22 x Key Observations included in GenInsights21, and (b) the 14 x Key Themes in the earlier GRC2018. 2) But also a tabulated Chronological Summary for the quarter in focus, which: (a) Lists each of the 92 days in the quarter; (b) Highlights the most significant days, across all of the metrics we analyse; and (c) Provides an index into further commentary in the report Appendix 1 49 page s NEM Heartbeat In this appendix we take a look at a number of different ‘heartbeat’ metrics that help to identify the overall health of the NEM, including: 1) Weather factors (like temperature) 2) Prices 3) System inertia ——- With GVSC we’ve been analysing system inertia as far back as in the GRC2018, as highlighted with this article of August 2019 . More recently the AEMO has been publishing its own derivation … which allowed us (beginning with the 2022 Q4 Update ) to begin highlighting how the two different measures compare: (a) Our bottom-up estimate, showing contribution from different types of plant; and (b) The AEMO’s published regional aggregate. With data from the 2023 Q1 update , on 20th July 2023 Jonathon Dyson published his article ‘Let’s talk about inertia’ via WattClarity – including a review the lowest inertia in Q1 202 (on 4th March 2023 both NEMwide, and in SA). Future Quarterly Updates continue this process. ——- 4) Frequency Performance, which is topical given exploration by others, such as Allan O’Neil in February 2023 . 5) Instantaneous Reserve Plant Margin (IRPM) … following from its inclusion in the 2022 Q3 update : ——- With respect to IRPM, here’s a sample of what’s been posted on WattClarity referenced back to GenInsights: (a) With respect to the 2022 Q3 update, one small snippet of the content of that Update was shared with WattClarity readers on 6th November 2022 in the article ‘Long-range trend of Instantaneous Reserve Plant Margin (IRPM) and focus on Q3 2022 – from GenInsights Quarterly’ . (b) As discussed in Appendix 1 for the 2022 Q4 Update, what a different quarter this one was! (c) On 3rd Feb 2024 in compilation of the 2023 Q4 Update, we posted about ‘Sky-high IRPM in the middle of the day, Sunday 1st October 2023’ . ——- 6) Following its addition in the preceding 2023 Q2 release, we continue analysis of LOR status (both actual and forecast): 7) new to the 2023 Q3 release, we have added in analysis of the NEM-wide ‘% VRE’ for the focused quarter. ——- During 2023 Q3 in relation to % VRE the early days of July 2023 particularly stood out, as a result of which we’ve progressively added successive stages of a Case Study on WattClarity: (a) on 6th November 2023 we posted ‘Case Study (part 1) of low % VRE NEM-wide on 3rd and 4th July 2023’ . (a) on 7th December 2023 we posted ‘Case Study (Part 2) of Low % VRE NEM-wide on 3rd and 4th July 2023’ . (c) with more to come … ——- 8) Also added in the 2023 Q3 release has been analysis of Interventions in the market over the preceding 12 month period. … + others. Appendix 2 30 pages The changing shape of Grid Demand In this appendix we take a look at the changing nature of Grid Demand, which necessitates looking into: 1) Different shapes of demand: (a) Starting with ‘Grid Demand’ (b) But then also analysing Rooftop PV shapes to also assess ‘Underlying Demand’. 2) Beginning with the 2022 Q4 Update , we’ve also added in some analysis of the forecastability of ‘Operational Demand’ … this uses a method of ‘Forecast Convergence’ we introduced in GenInsights21 to assess the changing challenges of forecasting what ‘Operational Demand’ will be 24 hours from the point of dispatch. Appendix 3 78 pages Wind and Large Solar In this appendix we take a look at different aspects of the performance of Wind and Large Solar assets (separately and together), including: 1) Production 2) Commercial Performance ——- With respect to these unit-level statistics for 2023 Q3, on Tuesday 5th December 2023 we posted how ‘Rooftop Solar is crushing* the returns for Large-Scale VRE’ . ——- 3) Curtailment 4) Self-Forecasting … and in particular for 2023 Q1 what changes in usage patterns can we see for those Solar Farms and Wind Farms who have deployed self-forecasting – given: (a) AEMO upgraded its AWEFS and ASEFS forecasting systems on 23rd November 2022 ; and (b) The 3-month long ‘Grace Period’ ended on 23rd February 2023 5) ‘ Forecast Convergence ‘ for aggregate VRE Capability (a) how accurate are the AEMO’s forecasts of Wind + Large Solar capability across the NEM, 24 hours from the point of dispatch? (b) given the growing installed capacity, with more Wind and Solar Farms being developed, to what extent is this challenge growing ? 6) Aggregate Raw Off-Target (a) in these Quarterly Updates, we continue to watch what’s happening in terms of collective deviation from Target across all the Wind and Solar Farms – updating and extending the analysis covered in WattClarity articles to 2020 . (b) Following the 2022 Q4 Update, we shared ‘some revelations in GenInsights Q4 2022 about Aggregate Raw Off-Target for Semi-Scheduled Units’ (c) Following the 2023 Q3 Update, we shared ‘Case Study (part 1) of large collective under-performance for Semi-Scheduled assets on Friday 18th August 2023’ … and will (time permitting) explore more about this event under this category on WattClarity . (d) In the compilation of the 2023 Q4 Update, we shared ‘A long-range trend of large instances of Aggregate Raw Off-Target (AggROT) across all Semi-Scheduled units . (e) On 25th Feb 2024 we shared both: >> ‘Tuesday 31st October 2023 sees the only two instances (in Q4, and all year) of AggROT for Semi-Scheduled units < -500MW . >> ‘Large instances of collective under-performance across all Semi-Scheduled units on Sunday 24th December 2023 . + more to come. Appendix 4 41 pages Firming (or dispatchable) Capacity In this appendix we take a look at different aspects of the performance of (fully) Scheduled assets (at various levels of bundling), including: 1) Performance specifically through Q4 2) Aggregate Scheduled Target (AggSchedTarget): (a) In absolute terms ——- With respect to the 2023 Q1 update, there are three snippets to be shared here on WattClarity: i. On 14th May 2023 we shared how ‘we’re not building enough replacement dispatchable capacity’ ii. On Wed 31st May 2023, we shared ‘Digging further into ‘Aggregate Scheduled Target’, to understand what Dispatchable Capacity is actually required’ iii. On Wed 30th Aug 2023, we shared ‘ Case Study of high AggSchedTarget on Thu 30th Jan 2020 and Fri 31st Jan 2020 (part 1!)’ and will continue with more analysis to be collated under this category on WattClarity . iv. On Fri 8th March 2023, we shared ‘Case Study of Sunday 12th November 2023 (lowest point for Aggregate Scheduled Target in 2023)’ as one very interesting day in 2023 Q4. ——- (b) Ramping from one Dispatch Interval to the next ——- During 2023 Q3 we found 7th, 8th and 9th Sept 2023 particularly of interest, such that we started an evolving Case Study as follows: i. on Tue 14th Nov 2023 we shared ‘Case Study (part 1) of Aggregate Scheduled Target on Friday 8th September 2023’ . i. on 6th Dec 2023 we shared ‘Case Study – Severe Weather Challenges Day-Ahead Forecasts for 7, 8, 9 September 2023 . iii. This ‘Case Study of Sunday 12th November 2023 (lowest point for Aggregate Scheduled Target in 2023)’ also included a view of some large 5-minute ramps (up and down) in AggSchedTarget. iv. On Fri 8th March 2023, we also shared ‘Case Study of Friday 8th Dec 2023 (big gyrations in Aggregate Scheduled Target)’ as one very interesting day in 2023 Q4. ——- (c) Daily ramping (i.e. MIN requirement to MAX requirement over the day) 3) Forecastability of AggSchedTarget (a) During 2023 Q3 we found 7th, 8th and 9th Sept 2023 particularly challenging as a result of the forecastability ——- 4) Firming capacity development schedule, matched with coal closure schedule. (a) In compiling the report for 2023 Q4, we shared a waterfall chart of Firming Capacity installed capacity base in this article about Engie’s closure of Snuggery and Port Lincoln . ——- Appendix 5 39 pages Coal Units The 44 x coal units still operational in the NEM in Q1 2023 (down 3 units, after 3 units at Liddell closed in 2023 Q2 ) are a special subset of dispatchable plant that have been addressed in more detail in this particular Appendix – because: 1) They still provide a large share of the Energy consumed in the NEM (and also the ‘Keeping the Lights on Services’ ); 2) But suffer from the big drawback of high emissions intensity. What this contains includes: 1) Performance specifically through the quarter in focus 2) Coal unit ‘dependability’ In the 180-page analytical component of the GRC2018 we included an extensive focus on the changing nature of different aspects of coal unit ‘dependability’. This was extended and updated in GenInsights21 . Now, in each quarter, we’re extending and updating further, with the inclusion of analysis of: (a) Changing levels of Unavailability ——- Following the 2022 Q4 update, on Mon 6th March 2023 we shared ‘Unavailability of coal units hits 24% across calendar 2022 (but they are *not* collectively tripping more often)’ … and we continue to track how this metric is changing as successive quarters roll past. ——- (b) Three different metrics that help to indicate the changing rate of ‘Sudden Failure’: i. number of Starts, ii. number of ‘Sudden Trip’, and iii. Aggregate Raw Off-Target . … in the compilation of the 2023 Q4 Update, we shared ‘A 20-year trend of large instances of Aggregate Raw Off-Target (AggROT) across 44 x coal units to 31st Dec 2023 . (c) Recently added to these Quarterly Updates, we’re now also separating out all hours in the quarter for each of the remaining coal units into three categories (Operational, Planned Outage and Forced Outage), which makes it clearer which units appear to be struggling and which units don’t appear to be struggling. ——- Some of this information was shared on Thu 19th Oct 2023 in the article ‘Two pieces of information (about Eraring Power Station) from the Origin Energy 2023 AGM’ … following the 2023 Q2 update. ——- 3) We also look at ‘ Forecast Convergence ‘ for Aggregate Coal Unit Availability across these ‘still operational’ coal units for this quarter. 4) Each quarter we take an updated look at the Closure Schedule. Appendix 6 38 pages Network Dynamics In this Appendix, we look at: 1) Regional Energy Balances 2) Regional Transfer Duration Curves 3) Specific interconnector operations … including (continuing from the 2023 Q1 update), the impact of various types of constraint 4) Renewable energy congestion … to augment what has been provided in Appendix 3 5) note that there’s no new information this quarter about Marginal Loss Factors (MLFs) in this issue, but has been in other updates when new information is available. … and in future Editions will add in other aspects. Hopefully this has provided some sense of what’s included in this Quarterly Update for 2023 Q4 . (B) How to order? Please contact us if you have more questions on the above, and please complete this order form and return to us to secure your order, remembering to flag which option you prefer: Option 1 = Document only (as integrated PDF); or Option 2 = both: (a) Document (as integrated PDF) + (b) Executive Briefing (noting that this is subject to availability) .",

    "date": "25-03-2024 03:38:00 PM",
    "content": "We’re coming to the business end of the long repair outage for Callide C3, which has been offline since 31st October 2022 (when the cooling tower partially collapsed) . Our last update in this series of articles was about a month ago : 1) in belatedly noticing a slight slippage in return to service expectations 2) with the RTS expectation at that time pushed back to 31st March 2024 (which is this Sunday). In a conversation with a client earlier today I was using the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view and noticed that there’s been another slight slippage … now back to Sunday 7th April 2024 as highlighted here: This shows the unit now expected to be online at part-load (200MW) on Sunday 7th April, with full load only a couple days later (Wed 11th April at 466MW). Opening up the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view , filtering to the CPP_3 unit and zooming in at the top (i.e. to the most recent updates) we see that this change was made on Saturday morning just passed (23rd March 2024): On the same day, CS Energy published the article ‘Update on Callide Unit C3 return to service’ which says: ‘The rebuild of the new Unit C3 cooling tower is nearing completion and re-commissioning of the C3 generator is underway. The change in the return to service date is required to allow time to address minor equipment issues which have arisen during the re-commissioning process of C3.

    "title": "A focused look at operations at Victoria Big Battery (VBB) on Tuesday 13th February 2024",
    "date": "24-03-2024 07:30:00 PM",
    "content": "Most readers will remember that Tuesday 13th February 2024 saw a ‘Major Power System Event’ occur in Victoria, triggered by some wild weather that included (bushfires leading to the unexpected shutdown of a large wind farm as a preamble before) strong winds destroyed 6 transmission towers (prompting some questions and) , leading to some significant load shedding. Already we have identified dozens of questions and observations that we would like to have time to delve into – including: 1) There were 27 Observations/Questions in the article ‘A quick first pass through ENERGY bids (for Victorian units) on Tuesday 13th Feb 2024’ on 17th February. 2) There were also 28 x Observation/Questions in the article ‘From the 4-second SCADA data, a view of Production by Fuel Type on Tuesday 13th February 2024’ , published on 18th February. 3) Plus there have been others occur to us in other ways as well … including via suggestions from readers. A small number of these have been explored further in subsequent articles. Whilst we obviously can’t hope to delve into all of these questions, we do hope to tick a few more off the list – in this article I’ll focus on the Victoria Big Battery , which was: 1) One of the batteries that were the subject of Observations/Question #24 & 25 in the review of bids article published 17th February; and also 2) The particular focus of Observation/Question #15 in the review of 4-second SCADA data published 18th February. 3) Plus also the subject of several questions from different clients/readers. Victoria Big Battery in the 4-second data Stripping away all the other battery units, here’s a view of both sides of the battery (with consumption to charge the BESS shown under the line) and with the frequency chart set with 50Hz as the equivalent zero line: remember with all of these images to click on the image to open a larger view in another browser window Doing this helps to visually line up which direction the battery was flowing over this 14-hour period when the frequency was above or below 50Hz. As noted in the review of bids article published 17th February and the earlier the review of 4-second SCADA data published 18th February, the peak discharge from the battery over the period was ‘just’ a little larger than 50MW … … which is noticeably below the Maximum Capacity of the unit (at 300MW on the discharge side). I was particularly interested in the period immediately surrounding Event #2 at ~13:08 ( NEM time ) on the day, so zoomed into a 30-minute window from 13:00 to 13:30 using the SCADA timestamps as the guide (but remembering the caveat that they might be a little out, due to being timestamped at the receiving end at the AEMO): The benefit of zooming into this particular period, we can see that there’s a clear difference between immediately before and immediately after the 13:08 time point when the transmission lines are reported to have failed : 1) Immediately before (i.e. in the 13:05 dispatch interval … and also much of the 13:10 dispatch interval): (a) the input profile for declining charging through until 13:05 neatly follows the implied trajectory from InitialMW to Target in that 5 minute period; and (b) In the 13:10 dispatch interval (at least up until 13:09:SS) the unit stays neutral – neither charging or discharging, as the Target requires. 2) Immediately afterwards however: (a) Whilst the Target suggests the unit should remain at 0MW through until the 13:30 time point (the limit of the window shown above) … (b) Actual profile is that discharge is strong from the battery: … albeit only up to just above 50MW and not all the way to the 300MW Maximum Capacity of the unit. (c) But this is what would be expected for a battery injecting to help support a rapidly declining frequency (d) Indeed, if the timestamps on the 4-sec SCADA data align, then: i. The injections from VBBG1 begin to ramp quickly (from 1MW to 8MW) at 13:09:47 ii. Which is the same time point when the frequency drops below the low-point of the Normal Operating Frequency Band (or NOFB ). (e) We can see injections to the grid continuing through the 13:15, 13:20 and 13:25 dispatch intervals 3) … until returning to a more neutral position from early in the 13:30 dispatch interval (at ~13:25:30), coincident with system frequency recovering to be just below 50Hz. Victoria Big Battery in the Market Data Time-travelling a copy of the ‘Station Dashboard’ widget in ez2view (from a ‘preparing for IESS’ version 9.9.1.98) we take a look at the operations of both sides of the Victoria Big Battery (on the chart – the table is focused on the discharge side) in the following image. In this snapshot for the 13:15 dispatch interval we see that the VBBG1 (i.e. exporting) DUID: 1) Is caught up in the ‘V>>NIL_MLGT_MLGT_R2’ constraint equation that’s bound at this dispatch interval: (a) which we’ve already seen mentioned in other articles also about the day; (b) this has the effect of driving the CPD Price for the unit below –$1,000/MWh (in other words, the unit could not bid in any way to achieve a dispatch target for the unit even if it wanted to ); 2) Although we note in this dispatch interval that: (a) the unit only has 45MW of available capacity (despite a Maximum Capacity on the discharge side of 300MW); and that (b) this 45MW of capacity was offered up at $3,944.97/MWh at the RRN for the ENERGY market: i. Which is well above the RRP in Victoria for the 13:15 dispatch interval ($393.75/MWh) ii. So it’s clear that the unit would not have received a Target, even in the absence of the bound constraint equation that makes it impossible for it to be other than 0MW. (c) I’ve not looked at each FCAS layer, at this point. 3) Remember that the ‘ Market Demand ’, the dispatch Targets, and the RRP for this 13:15 dispatch interval were all determined at ~13:10 and published to clients around ~13:10:20 … so just after the (13:08) start of frequency fluctuations above. 4) But we do see that the unit output increases from 20MW (InitialMW) to 54MW (FinalMW) in this dispatch interval in spite of the Target being 0MW: (a) So we wonder if a combination of Primary Frequency Control; and also (b) The effect of Raise FCAS services (both Regulation and Contingency)? (c) Indeed, we saw from the trace of the 4-second data above that the unit was ramped up (i.e. well above the target) as an inverse reaction to the low frequency. Five minutes later (at the 13:20 dispatch interval ), we see that: 1) The ‘V>>NIL_MLGT_MLGT_R2’ constraint equation that was bound before is also joined by the bound (and related) ‘V>>NIL_MLGT_MLGT_R5’ constraint equation ; 2) In terms of dispatch outcomes: (a) Because of the Over-Constrained Dispatch ( OCD ) process that kicked in for this period ( Allan’s review of the day discussed this ): i. it’s not possible to calculate the CPD Price for this period using the existing method that just queries information in the EMMS ii. hence in ez2view version 9.9.1.98 (shown above) we blank out the data; iii. in a future version we’ll do more to overcome this limitation in the EMMS data. (b) But we note that the unit does not get a dispatch target even though the RRP (at the $16,600/MWh Market Price Cap ) is well above the $3,944.97 at the RRN bid band that the capacity is offered in. 3) In this dispatch interval, in contrast to 5 minutes ago, the output drops from 54MW (InitialMW) to 10MW (FinalMW). A multi-commodity view Extracting data from NEMreview (also possible in ez2view ) I’ve prepared this bi-directional view of the battery, highlighting (on the discharge side) a multi-commodity view incorporating: 1) The Target for ENERGY; 2) The Enablement level for Regulation FCAS ; and also 3) The maximum (for each dispatch interval) for Contingency Raise FCAS services. This helps to see a clearer overall picture of the overall utilisation of the battery in terms of the propensity to discharge to supply ENERGY and/or RAISE services of various types. Zooming into the chart above, for the period from 13:00 to 17:00 (which includes the 2-hour period of the price spike), we see the following: In this zoomed chart we can see that: 1) For the 13:15 dispatch interval , the aggregate utilisation on the discharge side (in terms of aggregate ‘target’ across ENERGY and Raise FCAS services) was 50MW. (a) This was an even mix of Regulation and Contingency; (b) As noted above, the ENERGY target was 0MW. 2) For the 13:20 dispatch interval , this aggregate utilisation dropped to 0MW for reasons we don’t have time to explore here; but 3) From the 13:25 dispatch interval , there were a sequence of dispatch intervals where: (a) total enablement for Raise FCAS summed to 50MW; (b) with the exact mix changing from one dispatch interval to the next. About the SIPS But there’s a big gap between 50MW and 300MW Maximum Capacity (i.e. gap of 250MW ) that neatly maps to that reserved for SIPS during summer periods … so we thought it would be useful to take a detour and explore a hypothesis. To confirm what I had been thinking about the System Integrity Protection System (SIPS) that the Victorian Big Battery participates in, I did a bit of searching and have collated information about the VBB role in the SIPS in this article ‘Background information about the Victorian Big Battery and the SIPS service (System Integrity Protection System)’ also published today: Useful to highlight that, at the time of the transmission tower failure, the VIC1-NSW1 interconnector had been flowing northwards (i.e. target flow +260MW for the 13:10 dispatch interval) … in which case (according to my understanding of the SIPS requirements) the VBB was not required to discharge in event of a sudden transmission failure. Summing up So to briefly sum up – unless I am mistaken in some way (in which case please do let me know, either by public comment below, or privately one-on-one): 1) The analysis above seems to indicate that: (a) This assumes that the dispatch of the ‘250MW reserved for SIPS during summer’ was not meant to be triggered in these specific circumstances – despite the fact that this event included both: i. A large amount of load initially ‘shaken off’ as an immediate response to the transmission tower failure; and ii. Also included a large amount of load later load shed under ’Actual LOR3 ’ Load Shedding arrangements as AEMO struggled to balance supply and demand. (b) Whether the specific design of this arrangement might be improved is possibly(?) something that will be reviewed as part of the broader review of the incident. 2) But, as it stands, it highlights the need to discount the installed capacity of the Victoria Big Battery (and other plant like it) that’s assumed to contribute more generally to ‘Reliability’ settings when performing market modelling based Reliability calculations: (a) Such as in the ESOO and the ISP (b) A bit like derating of many different plant types during high-temperature summer periods?! Nothing further at this point.",

    "date": "24-03-2024 07:18:00 PM",
    "content": "In conjunction with today’s other article (which explores the operation of the VBB on Tue 13th Feb 2024) I’ve done some searching and have compiled the following background information with respect to the role of the Victorian Big Battery (VBB) with respect to the System Integrity Protection System (SIPS). (A) High-level explanation, from Neoen As they do for all of their assets in the NEM, Neoen has prepared an asset-specific website for Victoria Big Battery here . From this page I particularly noted the following: 1) From this educationally-focused Neoen page for the Victorian Big Battery , I’ve copied in the explanation that’s currently there, and added some highlights: ‘NETWORK SUPPORT The Victorian Big Battery will deliver a 250 MW network support service called SIPS which stands for System Integrity Protection Scheme. SIPS is a mode of operation where the battery has an automatic, instantaneous response to a network failure . When SIPS is triggered by an unforeseen power line failure or generator outage, the battery automatically charges or discharges to prevent a blackout. Batteries are incredibly well suited to perform this service because they can respond in the blink of an eye. Until recently, large power lines and state interconnectors had to maintain significant headroom to survive major interruptions. In recent years, SIPS from batteries has seen an increase in use unlocking this capacity, like opening up an extra lane on a freeway.’ 2) Also on the same site, the FAQs here contain the following: ‘ Q) What is SIPS? SIPS stands for Systems Integrity Protection Scheme. A 250 MW SIPS service contract was awarded to the Victorian Big Battery by AEMO under the Victorian Government’s SIPS 2020 procurement process . Put simply, the scheme enables the additional import of electricity over the Victoria to New South Wales interconnector of up to 250 MW at peak times . SIPS a mode of operation where the battery has a pre-programmed response to a network failure. When SIPS is triggered by an unforeseen power line failure or generator outage, the battery automatically charges or discharges to prevent a blackout. Batteries are incredibly well suited to perform this service because they can respond at warp speed. Until recently, large power lines and state interconnectors had to maintain significant headroom to survive major interruptions. In recent years, SIPS from batteries have been used to unlock this capacity like opening up an extra lane on a freeway.’ (B) From the Victorian Government I managed to find this 8-page update in the Government Gazette from 15th May 2020, at the commencement of the procurement process: (C) From the AEMO Searching further for the Victorian Government’s SIPS 2020 procurement process, we find the AEMO Media Release ‘AEMO completes System Integrity Protection Scheme procurement process’ on 5th November 2020 (i.e. 6 months after the notice in the Government Gazette above), which includes the following note: ‘… In the event of an unexpected network outage between November to March , the battery will automatically discharge energy within seconds, ramping to full output of 250 MW. This will allow AEMO time to safely optimise interconnector flows and dispatch other generation and storage within Victoria to keep the system stable and secure. …’ Thirteen months after the contract was noted by the AEMO above was the follow-on the AEMO Media Release ‘Victorian battery ready to deliver energy reserves this summer ’ on 8th December 2021, which includes the following note: ‘Following AEMO’s competitive tender process, Neoen was awarded the contract to supply up to 250 megawatts (MW) of energy reserve from its 300 MW/450 MWh battery to operate in a control scheme that increases the capability of the Victoria to New South Wales Interconnector (VNI). … About System Integrity Protection Scheme (SIPS) On 18 March 2020, the Victorian Parliament passed amendments to the National Electricity (Victoria) Act 2005 (Vic) (NEVA). This new legislation allows the Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change powers to modify or disapply sections of the National Electricity Law and the National Electricity Rules as they relate to specified augmentations, augmentation services or non-network services in respect of the Victorian transmission network. In November 2020, the Minister made orders under the NEVA that directed AEMO to enter into the SIPS Support Agreement to manage the procurement process to allow additional import of electricity over the Victoria to New South Wales Interconnector (VNI) of up to 250 MW at peak times between November and March.’ (D) From the Australian Energy Council Additionally, I found this very useful article by Allan O’Neil (frequent guest author on WattClarity) over on the AEC website ‘Victoria’s big battery: What exactly is it for?’ on 26th November 2020 (i.e. after the contract had been awarded, but before operations). In this article, Allan explains: ‘ How will it increase the capacity of the NSW-Vic interconnection? Of course, the VBB won’t change the physical size of the transmission assets connecting NSW and Victoria via the Snowy area [ii] . What it will do in some situations is allow that transmission to be operated at higher flow levels, because the battery will be contracted by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to provide rapid guaranteed backup to reduce flows if something goes wrong, and buy the market operator more time to rearrange the supply-demand balance. Without this guaranteed backup, the transmission lines carrying flows from north-east Victoria and NSW have to be operated more conservatively so there is no risk of very rapid thermal overload if one of their two parallel circuits trips. The battery’s contracted capability effectively provides additional headroom of up to 250 MW on these thermal overload limits, enabling higher imports under some conditions from NSW on top of flows from hydro generators in north-east Victoria and the Snowy scheme . These thermal overload limits are usually only important on very hot days in the peak summer period. For this reason AEMO is only contracting the battery to provide this 250 MW backup service from 1 November to 31 March each summer . AEMO will pay the battery owner $12.5 M per year (escalated with CPI) over the period 1 November 2021 to 31 March 2032. In some past years where reliability was tight, AEMO had contractual arrangements with large aluminium smelting loads in Victoria to use rapid demand reductions as backup for running the same transmission lines at high short-term ratings. So the concept underlying the import capacity increase enabled by the VBB is not new, only the means of achieving it. It’s not clear from the published justification for the VBB why it has been chosen in preference to demand side alternatives. Will the VBB always increase the interconnector limits? No . Obviously outside the summer period when VBB capacity is contracted to AEMO, interconnector thermal limits will be unaffected. Nor will the VBB directly affect capacity to export power from Victoria to NSW . And as well as thermal capacity limitations, AEMO imposes other types of constraint which can limit flow levels across transmission lines. “System security” constraints are designed to ensure that credible system disturbances such as trips of generation unit or transmission lines do not cascade into widespread disruption and blackouts. On the NSW-Victoria interconnection, as well as the thermal constraints discussed above, there are various non-thermal security constraints that can also limit power transfers. In mild weather or when hydro generation from Snowy and north-east Victoria is not near maximum levels – which is most of the time – one of these security constraints will normally be the limiting factor on maximum power imports from NSW. In relatively recent instances of load shedding in Victoria such as those experienced on 24-25 January 2019, the limits imposed by one of these security constraints were very close to the thermal constraints addressed by the VBB. This meant that even if more headroom had been available on the thermal constraints on those days, imports from NSW could not have been materially increased. Since then, AEMO has contracted with a NSW participant to provide voltage support services that will create more headroom under that security constraint, but only when Victoria would otherwise face load shedding or activation of Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT) reserves . The duration of this contractual arrangement is not stated. So while it’s clear that the VBB will assist in lifting NSW-Vic thermal constraints during peak summer periods, and is likely to assist in reducing the probability and / or size of load-shedding events, it’s not yet obvious what the overall impact on interconnector operation will be . It’s therefore worth qualifying the statement that the VBB will “lift NSW-Vic import capability by up to 250 MW” with the rider that a lot of the time the effective increase might be well under 250 MW, or even nil .’ (E) On WattClarity More generally, there are a range of articles that have been written about the Victorian Big Battery over time … many of which we’ve remembered to tag with Victoria Big Battery (VBB).

    "title": "ESIG Report ‘New Resource Adequacy Criteria for the Energy Transition’",
    "date": "24-03-2024 04:55:00 PM",
    "content": "Over the past week I became aware of the availability of the ESIG report ‘New Resource Adequacy Criteria for the Energy Transition’ that’s been published this month: I’ve not done any more than give if a very quick scan, but thought it might be of interest to our readers here on WattClarity ®. The subscribers email I received on Friday 22nd March 2024 about this report noted (with formatting added by me): ‘ As we move toward a cleaner and more weather-dependent power system , ensuring resource adequacy becomes more nuanced. It requires a new way of setting resource adequacy thresholds that is responsive to: Factor 1) the rapid load growth , Factor 2) plant retirements , and Factor 3) a shift toward variable and energy-limited resources. Resource adequacy criteria set the level of supply- and demand-side resources required for a power system to meet its reliability objectives. This standard influences billions of dollars of investment decisions. The most common resource adequacy criterion today—the one-day-in-10-year loss-of-load expectation (or LOLE) in North America. However, this single metric only measures the frequency of outages and doesn’t capture the size, duration, or timing of generation shortfalls . It also treats longer or widespread outages as equal to shorter, less severe outages. This failure to accurately reflect the real-world nature and impact of power outages, which vary enormously in their economic and human consequences, limits planners’ ability to accurately and efficiently plan a reliable system. The report explores what it might look like to adopt a multi-metric criteria approach, a framework that would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the size, frequency, and duration of shortfalls; explicitly consider rare, high-impact events such as extreme weather; and stress-test extreme events that may fall outside historical records. The report also discusses the need for a system’s resource adequacy criteria to establish the appropriate trade-off between reliability and cost. Different options for improving reliability come at different costs, and eliminating all risk in the system is not possible; therefore, as a society, we have to decide how much we will pay for reliability. It is crucial for resource adequacy criteria to capture this intrinsic link between cost and reliability, and for it to be transparent and well understood by all involved.’ The reference to ‘energy-limited resources’ reminds me of how we wrote about ‘The rise of Just-in-Time’ in GenInsights21 . Remember that in the NEM we utilise a probabilistic assessment of % Unserved Energy (USE), which is a different approach to the Loss of Load Expectation noted above that’s used in North America. Despite this difference, what’s in the ESIG report (especially in the light of the 3 Factors) might make for interesting reading in the context of the NEM…",

    "content": "On Friday 22nd March I saw via social media that the AER had (yesterday) released an Issues Paper with respect to Enhanced Wholesale Market Monitoring and Reporting. Given our focus on seeking to understand what’s happening in the National Electricity Market such that we can help others also understand via our software, this was naturally of interest to us. The Issues paper, and other associated materials, are linked below. The Report Other Materials You can download the 49-page PDF of the Issues Paper here: On the AER website are the following: 1) A Media Release titled ‘AER seeks feedback on Enhanced Wholesale Market Monitoring and Reporting Guideline issues paper’ . 2) Which links through to this Resource Page on the AER website. 3) That page links to pages below, including this Initiation Page . On a quick scan, the key points seem to be ( from this page ): There are changes to law that are expected to be enacted soon that ‘will expand the AER’s wholesale market monitoring and reporting functions to include wholesale gas markets and electricity and gas contract markets’ . Whilst this is all interesting, we’re particularly interested the electricity contract market side of things. ‘The Amendment Bill requires the AER to develop a guideline that outlines the scope for our wholesale market monitoring functions and the collection and reporting of information related to these functions.’ Whilst this is all interesting, we’re particularly interested the electricity contract market side of things. The AER say… ‘We are interested in stakeholder views on: • our approach to wholesale market monitoring and reporting, including our proposed key areas and questions for assessment and specific metrics that would be valuable for addressing the proposed key areas • what should be routinely collected and what types and classes of information should not be collected • our proposed targeted incremental approach and our initial areas of focus, as well as views on any alternative areas that we should consider • whether there are any agencies in addition to ASIC and ACCC that we should consider exploring information sharing arrangements with and how to further facilitate information sharing • the format, frequency and granularity of information collection as well as considerations of historical collection • the operationalisation of the AER’s disclosure and procedural fairness policies and frameworks. ’ Indicative timetable For ease of reference, I thought it would be useful to copy in the indicative timetable that was on this AER page: Event Date* Publish issues paper … which is now done Thu 21st March 2024 (i.e. yesterday) Stakeholder forum To register for this forum, visit this page at Eventbrite .

    "title": "Where’s that major planned outage for YWPS1 go?",
    "date": "22-03-2024 01:17:00 PM",
    "content": "Back on 3rd January 2024 I’d written ‘Two (of four) Major Rectification Outages at Yallourn performed. Have they improved plant performance (Part 1)?’ , and in that had noted that: 1) YWPS1 had a major planned outage coming up, that was at that time : (a) Starting 15th March 2024 (b) running 66 days (c) through until 20th May 2024. 2) YWPS4 had a major planned outage coming up, that was at that time : (a) Starting 24th August 2024 (b) running 55 days (c) through until 19th October 2024. 3) With YWPS2 (Nov-Dec 2023) and YWPS3 (Aug-Oct 2023) having already had their ‘let’s improve the plant performance’ major outages completed in 2023. Recently in an Executive Briefing to a client following delivery of GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q4 , we were asked whether we’d seen performance improvements with respect to the Yallourn station after these plant improvement outages. Where did that outage for YWPS1 go? Following from the article above, I’d set some alerts in ez2view Notifications Widgets looking at the YWPS1 and YWPS4 units coming offline, with a view that (when they came offline) I’d be able to track what was happening and potentially write an updated article. Even before that client question, I’d been wondering to myself where had that outage on YWPS1 gone , as I had been expecting it to start a couple weeks ago now (i.e. 15th March, as noted above). Remembering that planned outage schedules can change for a number of different reasons, it was more of an academic curiosity and I had not had time yet to look. But the client question recently prompted me to open up the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view to have a quick look today: With this widget filtered down just to show the coal units, then sorted by Region and DUID, the Yallourn units appear at the bottom of this list. We can see that: 1) YWPS3 had experienced a forced outage about a week ago; 2) YWPS4 is currently offline with a forced outage that looks like it’s slated to end soon; 3) But there’s no planned outages for the four units in the 4-week configured look-ahead period. So wondering when the planned outage for YWPS1 was shifted, and when to, I delved deeper, via the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view with the MT PASA DUID Availability date, filtered down just to the YWPS1 unit as follows: Remembering this widget allows one to ‘ look up a vertical ’ to see ‘that other dimension of time’ , we see that: 1) On 24th January the planned outage start date was pushed back by ~6 weeks; but then 2) More recently the planned start date was shifted forward a little to be 25th April 2024 (i.e. ANZAC Day). More on that unit outage later, when it starts … Also checking the major outage schedule for YWPS4 Whilst i had it opened, I flipped the filter to look at YWPS4 to see if there was any movement in outage schedule there as well … and there has been more recently: As noted here, from 2nd March 2024 the planned outage has been pushed back a little further … now the schedule says to start on 4th October 2024 . But there’s plenty of time between now and then, so will see how this unfolds. Any change in performance for YWPS2 and YWPS3? This is something I don’t have time to delve into today…",

    "title": "Further thoughts (part 2) about the design paper for the implementation of the proposed Capacity Incentive Scheme",
    "date": "21-03-2024 01:04:00 PM",
    "content": "Yesterday on WattClarity, I contributed ‘Some thoughts (part 1) about the design paper for the implementation of the proposed Capacity Incentive Scheme’ . In this article (part 2), I will discuss some details of its design that are open for consultation until Monday next week , 25th March 2024 . As discussed in Part 1 , the CIS has two forms of 15-year Capacity Investment Scheme Agreements (CISAs), Generation (for variable renewable energy) and Clean Dispatchable (for non-emitting dispatchable capacity, principally batteries). They each use a revenue collar and are conceptually similar, but also with necessary differences. The Paper discusses them at times collectively and sometimes separately. Below they are discussed collectively, with differences called out. The Collar concept Unlike a Contract for Difference (CfD), which settles every trading interval against market price and generation volume, revenue instruments are measured over time and take more cashflows into account. It is hoped the owner will operate as if it were a market exposed business , which, when operating between the ceiling and floor, it truly is. Meanwhile, by agreeing to share the extremities of the ranges of profit with government, the project is more bankable up front than were it entirely operating to market. But when operating at or near these extremes, incentives on the business will alter in undesirable ways, and the CISAs have features to combat this. In the Implementation Design Paper these structures are illustrated as follows – note the key difference, which is explained further below: For the Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) … which in the language of the CIS is ‘Generation’ For the Firming Capacity … which in the language of the CIS is ‘Clean Dispatchable’ capacity Figure 1 Revenue collar for Generation CISA Source: Implementation Design Paper Figure 2 Revenue collar for Clean Dispatchable CISAs Source: Implementation Design Paper For a Generation CISA, the collar is defined as “net revenue per MWh of generation ”, i.e. the revenue is divided by actual generation (at the regional reference node). This unit is shown in figure 1. It has the result of: protecting against adverse market conditions, but not poor physical performance. If revenue is down, because, say, there has been a wind drought, rather than weak prices, the asset will not be supported. In contrast, the Clean Dispatchable CISAs apply to the assets entire revenue without dividing by generation , and the collar is simply triggered by total dollars earned. This is aligned with both: the value of the firming capacity being in the quantity (i.e. MW) of capacity installed and available , not necessarily in its utilisation (i.e. MWh). the increasing uncertainty about what the utilisation of this capacity might be from one year to the next, depending on (amongst other things) underlying weather scenarios. There are a number of articles on WattClarity that analyse the challenges in this growing uncertainty . The floor and cap triggers are bid by the proponent at auction. The lower the triggers are offered per equivalent unit of capacity, the more likely it will be selected. The triggers may progressively escalate. Ceiling and floor payments are made quarterly, but then trued up at the end of a financial year, so effectively the green and red revenues above should be thought of as measured and applying over a year. The ceilings and floors intentionally don’t make the asset fully whole. A degree of market exposure is retained by the owner to incentivise performance . The proposed sharing, subject to consultation, is that the government covers 90% of the difference between actual revenue and the floor, and that 50% of any revenue above the cap should be handed over, up to an “annual payment cap” that is also bid in the tender. Assets must be owned by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) rather than embedded within an integrated portfolio. This is because the revenue collar requires the asset to operate and be accounted independently. If it were part of a portfolio, there is a natural incentive to operate or account it such that the CIS asset’s revenue is artificially depressed in favour of other assets. The SPV should enable transparent accounting around the asset, and there are rules and monitoring around contracts with related parties. However, it is difficult to devise any structure that can confidently be said to operate fully independently. What is revenue? The collar triggers on “net revenue”, which is not straightforward. In broad terms, it is the net revenue result of operating in spot and contract markets, i.e. pool revenue, plus green credits, plus or minus contract transactions, minus pool charges. All other operating costs are excluded. The government wants CISA assets to contract their output, and the settlement of those contracts does count towards the revenue collar. Because this invites contracts designed to transfer revenue elsewhere, a concept of “Eligible Wholesale Contracts” can disallow contracts if they are seen to be for the purpose of changing CISA payments. Whilst the checks on contracting seem appropriate against intentional gaming, it seems unavoidable that the mere presence of the floor would encourage greater risk taking when selling contracts than if it weren’t there. Generation CISAs (i.e. for Wind and Large Solar) Here’s Figure 1 again: For a Generation CISA, the collar is defined as “net revenue per MWh of generation”, i.e. the revenue is divided by actual generation (at the regional reference node). This unit is shown in figure 1. It has the result of protecting against adverse market conditions, but not poor physical performance. If revenue is down, because, say, there has been a wind drought, rather than weak prices, the asset will not be supported. This is to encourage the renewable generator to maximise generation where it can. Revenue divided by generation has the same unit as price, and although it is not strictly that, the collar triggers could be broadly described as “the volume weighted average price” of that generator across a year. Some significant matters where the generation collar intentionally does not protect assets are: Negative prices . Spot market payouts due to running during negative prices does not subtract as a negative revenue. This is necessary, as to leave in the scheme an incentive to maintain output during periods of excess renewable supply would be very costly and create a power system security issue. Like all renewable investors, an expectation of negative prices correlating with output remains a serious consideration to bidders. Calculating the “volume weighted average price” discussed above first requires truncating all negative prices to zero. Congestion, connection delays and security constraints . Because revenue is divided by output, declines in revenue due to such curtailments is worn by the investor. Again, this is necessary to encourage the investor to locate and operate in a way that minimises these risks. Loss factors . By applying the current loss factors to the denominator, a decline in revenue due to an unfavourable movement in loss factors is not protected. Generation CISA variants The Paper seeks input on whether to offer two variants to the Generation CISA, each of which would remove the necessity of a SPV. The first variant is to model the NSW Roadmap “option” design where instead of an ongoing revenue collar, an operator has the right to exercise an option when business conditions prove unfavourable. Upon exercise, a one-year CFD applies to any generation not already subject to an eligible contract and the transfer of all green certificates to government. It also invokes a revenue sharing cap for the rest of the life of the CISA. The second variant applies the collar only to the spot revenue coming from the proportion of generation not spoken for by a sold eligible contract . If an operator has sold contracts equivalent to half of its capacity, then the revenue coming from the spot exposed half would be divided by half the total output to determine the net revenue per MWh of generation for triggering the collar. Clean Dispatchable CISAs (i.e. for Firming Capacity – but not fossil fuelled) These CISAs apply to the assets entire revenue without dividing by generation, and the collar is simply triggered by total dollars earned. Here’s Figure 2 again: Like Generation CISAs, revenue includes spot income (including ancillary services), minus the cost of charging and other pool costs, plus or minus eligible contract transactions, plus any green (if eligible) or (possibly in future) capacity payment income. Delivery and Performance The CISA’s design means that the assets can mostly be left on their own to perform in response to market incentives, but there are a few obligations. Successful projects must commit to a commercial operation date as a contracted milestone. Bidders are likely to have to submit a bond , to inhibit non-serious bids. The bond is not discussed in the Paper, but in a public forum the order of a few hundred thousand dollars was mentioned. Generation CISAs will be subject to a minimum generation requirement to encourage high availability. The Paper suggests by example at least 75 percent of the 90 percent probability of exceedance (PoE) generation but does not discuss how that threshold is determined nor whether there are exemptions for negative prices, congestion and system limits. Clean Dispatchable CISAs will be required to have a tested capacity at least what it bid in the auction (it may include a degradation profile) and an ongoing availability over 90 percent. As per the NSW Roadmap and Vic/SA tender at least 50 percent of the Clean Dispatchable capacity must be available to run during an actual Lack of Reserve ( LOR3 )event . This is apparently insisted upon by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and sits incongruously with the self-incentivised rest of the instrument. 1) Whilst it appears a minor constraint, it limits dispatch flexibility for a storage asset defending contracts. 2) Its emergence suggests misunderstanding of the way the market operates during an extended crisis such as June 2022. As administrative pricing destroys incentives to store energy (which was described as Theory 2 in this article on WattClarity at the time ), AEMO must already intervene by directing all energy-limited plants, not just CISA ones, which are kept whole by direction compensation. Thus, the constraint doesn’t appear to be of value to AEMO anyway. Eligibility Technology Both CISAs are only available to scheduled or semi-scheduled capacity over 30MW that does not produce emissions. Given recent trends, the Clean Dispatchable CIS will be dominated by large-scale batteries. There is no requirement to charge the batteries with renewable energy, a suggestion that was sensibly discarded in 2023. Whilst not necessarily competitive, renewable-fuel plant is eligible, but not native forest waste. Demand-Side Response (DSR) and Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) are not eligible in the first rounds, but the government proposes to consider them in future tenders. The exclusions of non-scheduled plant, DSR and VPP are for understandable practical reasons as they would require bespoke administrative arrangements for relatively small returns. Whilst the government supports DSR and VPPs, each has difficulties in a scheme like the CIS in gaining confidence that government is paying for genuinely additional and firm capacity. The most significant exclusion, peaking gas turbines, was an ideological decision made at ministerial level in 2022 and discussed in Part 1 . Readiness and Cutoff dates To participate in a tender, the project would need to have at least arranged its land tenure and begun connection discussions . There will be aggressive delivery date requirements and as a result the government openly expects the CIS to favour mature technologies (wind, large-scale solar and large-scale batteries). The CIS is intended to build new assets, but the cutoff date for getting AEMO committed status is not the time of the tender but instead the date of the original ministerial announcements of the two CISAs: 8 December 2022 for Clean Dispatchable (i.e. Firming) and 23 November 2023 for Generation (i.e. VRE). Although this looks strange, it is necessary to avoid a perverse incentive to pause a project already underway. Projects who were committed before the tender will face a difficult challenge in determining their bid parameters, as it will be based on their assessment of the competition rather than their own costs which are sunk. Being a “pay as bid” auction , they will either underbid and leave money on the table or overbid and miss out entirely. Common-clearing price auctions would be fairer but impossible due the way CIS tenders are assessed. Storage Depth The minimum storage depth is two hours , however the government is aware deeper storage is more valuable and notes the Vic-SA tender applied a four hour minimum . In the Western Australian Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) Reserve Capacity Mechanism (RCM) a simple linear conversion has been used to normalise battery capacity by dividing the depth by 4 hours. The Paper however proposes that tendered capacity is compared instead by the effect it has in reducing Unserved Energy (USE) in probabilistic modelling . This is certainly more accurate and defensible but is less transparent. Its not clear how different storage depths would be counted towards the 9GW target. It seems a simple normalisation might be used in this case. Participation in other schemes This section will entertain cynics. Eligible CIS projects may not receive other government support, but then the Paper lists as exceptions to this rule all conceivable forms of government support. The exceptions list even has a catch all, “Other forms…where the financial support is stipulated to be complementary to the CIS…” , which seems an invitation to states to top up their favoured projects with some extra pork. Selection Stage A Like other schemes, the tender begins with an unpriced technical shortlisting . In stage A all structural details on the project are provided, demonstrating the credibility of the project and proponent. Importantly it provides technical information to determine the project’s system impact at the selection stage. Stage A also requires subjective information about local content, worker conditions, community and First Nations consultation and end of life plans. Bidders will likely engage a communications advisory firm to prepare the sort of text that government likes to see. Stage B Those who pass Stage A submit their pricing bid variables in Stage B and required contract variations. They also back up the subjective information from Stage A into a “social licence commitment”, which presumably requires measurable specifics such as identifying local parts suppliers and how many apprentices will be taken on. Assessment Financial selection is not a simple comparison of bid prices but a complex modelling exercise. By feeding the project into a model, the expected exposure to government from the collar can be simulated. This is divided by the model’s estimate of, for Generation CISA, the renewable energy produced, and for Clean Dispatchable CISA, the avoided USE. The Clean Dispatchable selection will also investigate “broader system benefits”, presumably such as ancillary services. It will also consider the project’s ability to reduce market price. The modelling approach, if done well, is perhaps as good as is possible for selecting such a tender. It will inherently favour forms of renewable energy that operates at times of greater system value and is less congested. It will also favour deeper storage, but only to the extent that the power system needs it given other sources and the expected length of renewable energy droughts. Technical matters like cycling losses will also be captured. Including the ability to reduce market price is a questionable selection objective. Prices are notoriously difficult to model and depend on gross assumptions around future ownership structures, market power and contracting and bidding strategies. It is also doubtful that government should be trying to drive price anyway in its micro-decisions, which impacts other investors and the government’s own payments under the CIS. Fortunately, it seems likely that the priority order of projects from their modelled system benefits would be the same priority order as their modelled impact on price. Merit selection will also consider the social licence commitment. These subjective matters may be politically necessary but endanger the appearance of fairness and probity, especially as local content and worker conditions introduce the potential for bias towards favoured business and unions. Hybrid Projects The Paper provides an option for a renewable energy generator with a battery at its connection point to bid as a hybrid project and will be classed as a Generation CISA . The modelling described above should be able to capture the benefits deriving from the battery, e.g. generation can be somewhat better correlated to system need. It will require some more complexity in its bidding parameters. The paper seeks comment on that and whether some hybrid projects might be better classed as Clean Dispatchable CISA, and how this would be done. Conclusion Having made all the macro decisions at ministerial level, bureaucrats’ freedom in this design process is limited, but they have exercised it well. As far as a design for a scheme that uses a collar to de-risk a huge quantity of investment whilst leaving it operating within a market, this is near as good as you can expect. Whilst it was already underway, the CIS comprehensively ends the 25-year NEM experiment in market driven investment . Investment decision making has now fully reverted to governments as it was before de-regulation, albeit now with a commonwealth role. Operationally however, the NEM should continue , with efficient national dispatch and participant contracting that will continue largely as is. The bureaucrats should be commended for designing the CIS to at least retain part of the NEM furniture.",

The 2024 GSOO continues to forecast risks of shortfalls on extreme peak demand days from 2025 and the potential for small seasonal supply gaps from 2026, predominantly in southern Australia, ahead of annual supply gaps that will require new sources of supply from 2028. Gas consumption by residential, commercial and industrial consumers is forecast to decline, but production in the south is forecast to decline faster. While the scale of gas consumption remains uncertain through the energy transition, particularly in relation to gas usage for electricity generation, all scenarios identify the urgent need for new investments to maintain supply adequacy. Gas inadequacy risks over the short, medium, and long term include: … [Read the Exec Summary for the List]’ So will be interesting reading.

    "title": "Some thoughts (part 1) about the design paper for the implementation of the proposed Capacity Incentive Scheme",
    "date": "20-03-2024 03:37:00 PM",
    "content": "This is the first of a two part discussion on the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) Implementation Design Paper (The Paper) released on 1 March 2024. This part will cover its broad objectives and implications. The second part will discuss some details of its design that are open for consultation until 25 March (next Monday) . Summary Last November the commonwealth announced that its CIS will become the prime investment driver of Australia’s electricity transition for the rest of this decade through two enormous underwriting streams: 9 GW of Clean dispatchable capacity (read grid-scale batteries), and 23 GW of renewable generation (read large-scale wind and solar). Most of this will go in the NEM, but Western Australia and Northern Territory will receive pro-rata shares, consistent the Australian constitution’s expectations of equal treatment. Consultations on how the non-NEM CIS will be managed are promised for the near future. The Capacity Investment Scheme Agreements (CISAs) will be rolled out with six monthly tenders in each jurisdiction, with the next (6 GW of Generation CISAs ) to occur late next quarter. Two clean dispatchable tenders have effectively already occurred: The completed New South Wales roadmap firming tender round 2 of last November is counting 480MW of batteries against the CIS, and The South Australia-Victoria early CIS tender round that closed on 23 Feb, targeting 600MW of dispatchable capacity. The underwriting is a 15-year revenue collar, where the government de-risks investments by sharing extended periods of low or high revenues. The structure is broadly drawn from the New South Wales roadmap’s work on Long-term Energy Service Agreements (LTESAs) floors, except that CISAs are two-way collars. As well as providing protection from periods of low revenue periods (floor), periods of high revenue are shared with government (cap). The government’s liabilities are on the commonwealth’s budget so it is funded by taxpayers, unlike the New South Wales roadmap which is funded through consumer levies. Tenderers bid this floor and cap. The modelled cost to government is then divided by the significance of the project to the power system and becomes the main selection criterion. The government wants the assets to participate within the spot and contract markets as if they were merchant plays. In a nutshell, the government still wants investors to build assets for market returns, but by de-risking investments cases from the most adverse scenarios, their required rates of return will presumably be lower and so plant is built sooner. Yet there is a trade-off between de-risking finances and distorting operations. The design engages with this tension, for example the floors and caps are not 100% revenue transfers. Even when triggered, assets retain some market exposure. Energy companies operate integrated portfolios, but that’s a problem when it includes an asset with a revenue collar. Therefore, the design requires the assets to be run at arm’s length, in a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), to inhibit the company transferring value to gain access to the government’s floor or avoid the cap. With respect to New South Wales projects, the government will instead leverage the existing LTESA design, underwriting support for additional capacity beyond the Roadmap’s targets, as New South Wales’ share of the CIS kitty. How did it come about? The Capacity Mechanism Minister Bowen entered government in May 2022 just as the Energy Security Board (ESB) was concluding several years’ work on a NEM capacity mechanism , which, like those used in Western Australia and overseas, was neutral to plant age and technology type. At the time, the new minister was very supportive of the ESB’s work. With the optimism of a new government, he also sought commonwealth-state consensus decisions through the National Energy Transformation Partnership . Perhaps cynicism may have served better as the capacity mechanism soon foundered upon state ideologies, with Victoria vetoing any fossil-fuelled technology from the mechanism, whilst other states and AEMO continued to see gas and diesel playing a significant backup role. The commonwealth ultimately solved the impasse with an entirely different approach of underwriting new investment in “clean dispatchable capacity”. They may have different ideologies, but one thing states can agree on is having federal money spent on them, which is what the CIS promises, and as a result it has survived the Partnership. Whilst underwriting new zero emissions technology may have been necessary given our federation, it is not the sort of approach that economists, like those at the ESB who developed the capacity mechanism, would recommend: Firstly markets, rather than government, should determine how much and what should be built in response to market signals that express customer needs. Indeed, the CIS’ geographical split seems likely to be determined more by the Australian constitution than need. Secondly, all technologies should be treated equally according to their ability to contribute to reliability. Environmental policy should separately target actual pollution. For example, a diesel peaking plant provides excellent reliability support with trivial emissions due to how rarely it runs. Thirdly, existing capacity contributes equally to reliability as new capacity, so it should be similarly rewarded. Otherwise, there are perversely different incentives depending on plant age. And by only supporting new entry, previous market investors are undermined, which is sending a very poor message. The Clean Dispatchable CIS The federal government had decided that it would roll out dispatchable capacity of a form that appeased all the states, i.e. zero emissions, underwritten in a way that also appeased all the states, i.e. by the federal budget. As a centre-left government, it had no ideological problem with a government auction replacing market investing and looked for ways to do it at least cost to government and to hopefully keep something of a market working after the investment. A common approach to shore up reliability is standing reserve , i.e. backup capacity that is purposefully held out of the market to step in as a last resort before load shedding, like AEMO’s existing Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT). By sitting idle during high prices, it is loss-making, but in doing so avoids discouraging market investors. Government dislikes this because it involves measurable costs that can be used to criticise it, and precisely because it doesn’t suppress prices. Another approach is with government grants . Investors could tender for a government handout, for which the only strings attached is that a working asset must get successfully built in a timeframe. After that it is left to run in the market like any other plant. This lowers new entry costs for otherwise market investors, and in the short-term at least, should lower prices. The cost to government is fixed and known up front, which appeals to their treasuries, but not necessarily to ministers, because explicit costs are readily weaponised against them. More politically attractive was the New South Wales roadmap’s LTESA floor structure . It is intended that in most years LTESA assets are left alone as market players. However, to win a LTESA, the asset bids a revenue floor, and if conditions in an operating year prove unfavourable, it can ask to have its revenue topped up to that floor. Whilst the investor still must run a business case estimating market returns, it can at least rule out adverse revenue scenarios. LTESA costs are unknown up front, but this is not a problem to the New South Wales treasury, because in the LTESA, customers cover the payouts. The CIS was inspired by the LTESA. It however chose a collar rather than a floor, where a revenue transfer can to government in good years. This seems driven mostly by a superficial appearance of fairness and avoiding the embarrassment of a government supported asset occasionally earning super-normal profits. It however complicates dispatchable assets’ role in contract markets as a provider of insurance against high prices, when it need high revenues to back the insurance it has sold. The CIS allows contract payouts to be deducted from the revenue trigger, so this can be avoided by selling long-term contracts ahead of high price years. In December 2022 the government announced that its CIS collar arrangement would become the tool by which reliability would be maintained through the transition. It will help build many large-scale batteries, complementing a power system where energy mostly comes from variable renewable sources. However, at that time the CIS was not suggested to build the renewable energy itself. Eighty-two percent Although it was never an election promise, and by accident rather than design, achieving an 82 percent share of renewable energy in national (not just NEM) electricity supply by 2030 has become the government’s firm commitment . This gave the government a self-inflicted headache. Due to a host of practical constraints the target seems almost certain to be missed, although possibly by only a year or two, which, in a decades-long transition, is inconsequential beyond the political beltway. Whilst no amount of money will accelerate some of the constraints, such as community acceptance, some more cash would help developers in the worldwide competition for equipment and engineers. The government therefore looked for a way of topping up what wind and solar investors receive, the “black” electricity spot price plus the “green” Large Generation Certificates (LGCs). Ways to get more renewable business cases over the line Expanding the Renewable Energy Target (RET) was considered as it would raise the price of LGCs. But this would be costly for consumers as both the volume and price of mandatory retailer surrender increases. It would create a very large value transfer from customers to existing renewable energy. Already, thanks to the growth of voluntary markets, LGC prices have held up much longer into this decade than most legacy renewable investors would have expected. Contracts for differences (CfD) have been used by many European governments, as well as Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory as a way of fully de-risking renewable generation from the market. The government absorbs all price exposure. Or, in other words, having created a market, the government creates an instrument to nullify it! This makes an investment case very straightforward indeed and enables ministers to announce what appear, up-front, to be very cheap contracts indeed. However, CfDs have many downsides : Their true cost is unknown and can be quite enormous if the actual volume weighted price realised by the apparently cheap asset becomes unfavourable. Valuable operating signals from market exposure is lost. For example, in the Australian Capital Territory’s case, the government absorbs negative price risk, with the result that some assets keep running during extreme negative prices, creating a security problem and large losses. The government becomes the contractor to much of the industry. It has a “long” exposure to price which is of no use to it but could have been to retailers. Once CfDs have material volume, they create imbalances between spot and contract markets. Having rejected the above alternatives, and enthused by the CIS it was designing for dispatchable capacity, in November 2023 the government went all-in and extended the CIS collar concept to also drive the rest of the renewable energy build out. By any measure, 23GW of Generation CISAs in half a decade is an enormous proposition. Details of how the CISAs work is provided in Part 2. Some high-level implications Future Investment Whether it intended it or not the federal government has given the industry a clear message that from now on it will be the prime determinant of new upstream electricity supply and storage. Forget market signals, it is hard to see how any private investor would now enter without a CISA and/or state-based support. As such, there seems not much point in picking up the ESB’s stalled task and re-exploring market designs to enhance incentives for new investment. Governments have taken on this job themselves, at least for this decade. Yet thanks to the many state schemes that were already in play, this state of affairs may already have been the case before the CIS. Perhaps the CIS just sensibly recognises that reality. And if investment must now all be government driven, the commonwealth has the deep pockets to underwrite a transition on this scale. Some parties have modelled that even this 23 GW of CIS generation will not get Australia to the 82 percent target , correctly recognising there is now no prospect of other large-scale market investments. Their implication was a call for yet more ambition in it or other schemes. But it would be more sensible to ignore or relax the target a few years, as it can’t be met anyway. Impact on the existing market With de-risked new entry, and no capacity mechanism, premature retirement of coal plant seems a risk, however all the privately owned plants seem likely to get individual contracts to underwrite their final years. Meanwhile the Queensland and Western Australian governments will have the final say in their owned plants’ closures. For existing gas and diesel-fired peaking plant , 9GW of underwritten dispatchable competition may sound unfair but will be more than offset by capacity lost through coal retirement. And as this 9GW will be mostly storage, energy unlimited peaking plant will realise new value as seller of last resort energy insurance. Indeed, Victoria’s insistence that no gas or diesel capacity participate may ironically prove a boon to exactly that technology. Things seem more challenging for the existing wind and solar fleet. The Generation CIS will favour diversity in renewable energy output, but has WattClarity has demonstrated many times, this can only be at the margin. The negative correlations between price and wind and sun that we already see will get ever stronger. There will be some relief thanks to the batteries themselves, loss of coal minimum generation levels and interconnector strengthening, but these will be far outweighed by the sheer scale of new wind and solar. There will be a large fleet of legacy renewable assets exposed to this negative correlation , but without a revenue floor to call upon. So, could they become so financially impaired that they risk early closures? It seems unlikely, as their on-going operating costs are of a different order than coal. The CIS also provides an interesting option, perhaps unintentional, to rebirth legacy plant. A no regrets play for an existing windfarm is to put in a CIS repowering bid. If it wins, it upgrades its turbines and gets a revenue floor. And if not, it keeps the old turbines running and tries again at the next auction. It seems likely that the CIS generation stream revenue floors will be frequently called upon as the market correctly signals it has just got too much energy when the weather is sunny or windy. Paying out on these floors will then become a large ongoing burden on the commonwealth budget but will not become apparent until after the agreements are committed, perhaps not until the 2030s. From aluminium smelters to feed in tariffs, we have seen this story play out many times before. More detail from the design paper is discussed in Part 2, which will come soon.

    "date": "18-03-2024 04:00:00 PM",
    "content": "Let’s start this article by reminding readers of Linton’s excellent explanation about ‘ What inputs and processes determine a Semi-Scheduled unit’s availability’ . Distilling from this article, there are three sources of the Availabilit y figure that could be used within the NEMDE dispatch process (it can get a lot more complicated upstream of this, as Linton’s article shows). These three sources are tabulated below. When was this source introduced? Headline Details from 7th Aug 2023 MaxAvail in the Bid On 7th August 2023 , following requests from a number of stakeholders ( including Marcelle here ) the AEMO implemented a small but significant change for Semi-Scheduled units, in enabling them to utilise the MaxAvail field in the standard bidding process to provide the market notice of physical limitations with respect to their Solar Farm or Wind Farm. … there’s a growing series of articles about this change accumulating under this Category on WattClarity ®. Just yesterday we published the short article ‘How many Semi-Scheduled units have taken advantage of the market change that went live on 7th Aug 2023?’ . from Sept 2019 A participants Self-Forecast (if they use one) Trials of Self-Forecasting were commenced with the coordination of AEMO and ARENA – with ARENA calling for expressions of interest on 28th March 2018 from various parties. From September 2019, suitably approved Self-Forecasts were allowed to substitute for the AEMO-developed forecasts in AWEFS and ASEFS. Since that time, we’ve been collating a number of articles written on this site under the Category ‘Self-Forecasting for Semi-Scheduled units’ . 31st March 2009 AEMO sourced information (e.g. AWEFS or ASEFS) This Glossary Page about the ‘Semi-Scheduled’ Registration Category provides much more detail about this category, which came into being on 31st March 2009. For the commencement of this category, the AEMO began producing an Unconstrained Intermittent Generation Forecast ( UIGF ) for each individual Wind Farm and Large Solar Farm that exists in the NEM for each dispatch interval: 1) In the early days this was a service that was contracted in from a third party service provider; but 2) From 23rd Nov 2022 this service was upgraded as a result of being brought in-house. At Global-Roam Pty Ltd , we’ve been taking an increasing interest in the operation of Semi-Scheduled units over a number of years, including: 1) Through GenInsights Quarterly Updates , including (as part of Appendix 3); and also 2) Via the Generator Statistical Digest, with the most recent issue ( the GSD2023, released on 15th Feb 2024 ) including a focused section in Volume 1 specifically focused just on Semi-Scheduled units . 3) Plus other recent initiatives (more on them later …) Just yesterday we published the short article ‘How many Semi-Scheduled units have taken advantage of the market change that went live on 7th Aug 2023?’ . Today we take a similar look at the second leg of this three-legged stool, with respect to the adoption of self-forecasts. Self-forecasts possible from Sept 2019 As noted above, Semi-Scheduled DUIDs have been able to utilise self-forecasts in the NEMDE dispatch process since September 2019. Indeed, this process has been actively encouraged by AEMO and other organisations (such as ARENA). Given the encouragement, we’ve also been taking an increasing interest in self-forecasting as one particular aspect of (hopefully!) making the Semi-Scheduled category work more effectively…. Using the GSD2023 Data extract With the recent release of the GSD2023 on 15th Feb 2024 (just over 4 weeks ago), we’ve been presented with an easy way to take this next look at how much utilisation this new market change has been seeing from the range of Semi-Scheduled generators to whom it was directed. A 49% (actual) participation rate, through 2023 In this first chart we highlight (in green) the number of Semi-Scheduled DUIDs that utilised self-forecasts in the NEMDE dispatch process through each month of 2023: Whilst each month is shown (on the left), the annual aggregate for 2023 is shown on the right of the chart. This highlights that, through all of 2023: 1) 80 x Semi-Scheduled DUIDs had self-forecasts used in dispatch for at least part of the year; which means 2) There were 84 x DUIDs remaining that did not use self-forecasts at all. 3) On those numbers, this was a 49% participation rate. So we continue to look for more… A 49% (actual) participation rate, through 2023 Counting up the ‘hours in use’ across all 164 Semi-Scheduled DUIDs, and sorting in descending order of application, we see the following: In this chart there are the two blocks of DUIDs: 1) The 80 x DUIDs with some non-zero bars showing some participation; but also 2) The ‘invisible’ 84 x DUIDs on the right. Zooming into just the 80 x DUIDs on the left we see the following: We’ve highlighted this group in 4 bundles: Bundle 1 = the 24 DUIDs (with names listed) with self-forecasts used in dispatch more than 8,000 hours through the year; Bundle 2 = the 21 DUIDs (names obscured) with self-forecasts used more than 7,000 hours, but less than 8,000 hours. Bundle 3 = the 15 DUIDs (names obscured) with self-forecasts used more than 6,000 hours, but less than 7,000 hours. … so with Bundles 1, 2 and 3 representing 60 DUIDs (or only 37% of the total list of Semi-Scheduled DUIDs) using self-forecasts in dispatch more than 68% of all dispatch intervals in the year. Bundle 4 = another 20 DUIDs (names obscured) with self-forecasts in use, but less than 6,000 hours … presumably at least some of these being in commissioning, and/or having their self-forecasts in commissioning. But reality is more complex than that… At this point, it’s worth reminding readers of some complexities of the self-forecasting process (and in assessing self-forecasting performance) as described by Linton in his article “Delving deeper into dispatch availability self-forecasting performance” on 14th April 2023. In particular we will highlight here that, whilst an organisation might submit a self-forecast for a dispatch interval (or actually might submit multiple … though that’s a whole other can of worms), that does not guarantee that it will be used in dispatch . Indeed, there can be quite a difference , as we show below, because: 1) The self-forecast might be self-suppressed … and that this might be: (a) by the vendor (more about them later), (b) by the generator, or (c) by the generator’s agent (e.g. an organisation like Overwatch Energy Pty Ltd , of which we have been a shareholder since 2019 ) 2) The self-forecast might also be suppressed by the AEMO . … in Linton’s article , he explains how this works. We can clearly see in the improved sort order below that only a subset of self-forecasts actually make their way through to the dispatch process . This is shown for calendar 2023 in this expanded sorted chart here (again from the GSD2023 Data Extract ): Readers should be sure to note that: 1) There are 14 more units listed in this chart than in the two sorted charts above 2) The sort order is different than that shown in the charts above; 3) In this case there is a higher number of units who have been consistently submitting self-forecasts (i.e. 76 x DUIDs submitting for more than 8,000 hours in 2023) than there were with self-forecasts actually being used (i.e. only 24 x DUIDs with self-forecasts used more than 8,000 hours). … that’s only 32%! (i.e. 24/76) 4) We can clearly see that there are some units who have been ‘AEMO suppressed’ for a significant percentage of the year: (a) 3 x DUIDs were AEMO suppressed for 100% of the dispatch intervals they submitted through the year … despite submitting for more than 7,000 hours! (b) Another 6 x DUIDs were also AEMO suppressed for 100% of the dispatch intervals submitted through the year: i. where submitting less than 1,300 hours (right hand end of the chart) ii. without looking further, these would seem to be commissioning? 5) On top of this, there have been instances where units have been significantly ‘self-suppressed’ for a significant percentage of the year: (a) 4 x DUIDs were AEMO suppressed for 100% of the dispatch intervals they submitted through the year … despite submitting for more than 7,000 hours! (b) Many more self-suppressed for a significant percentage of (a large number of hours in which they submitted) self-forecasts. There’s clearly more pieces to this puzzle! Reasons for self-suppression become murky … We’ve written before about some practices that a number of NEM stakeholders see as dubiou s , in relation to the selective use of self-forecasts. With this new data set in the GSD2023 , we’ve enabled clients to drill into more detail of the extent to which self-suppression was used, and whether this was in periods in which Semi-Dispatch Cap flag status was TRUE or FALSE. That’s one other dimension of analysis. But that’s enough here for now …",

It’s also worth reminding readers of Linton’s excellent explanation of the complexities behind ‘ What inputs and processes determine a semi-scheduled unit’s availability’ . Adoption of this Market Change? Nine days after that change, Linton published these ‘Initial Results’ in relation to the early adoption of this new capability. But since that time, I’ve been curious about what the ongoing take-up has been, with questions like: Q1) What DUIDs (and participants) have adopted this new approach… (a) and under what circumstances? (b) for what periods of time (in aggregate)? Q2) Are there any DUIDs (and participants) who have, conversely, not used this new option? (a) if so, what are the reasons for this lack of adoption? (b) are there cases where participants have not even been aware that this was a possibility? Alas, no time since then to look, until now … Using the GSD2023 Data extract With the recent release of the GSD2023 on 15th Feb 2024 (just over 4 weeks ago), we’ve been presented with an easy way to take this next look at how much utilisation this new market change has been seeing from the range of Semi-Scheduled generators to whom it was directed. 1) New to this issue is a section in Volume 1 that’s focused specifically on semi-scheduled units ; 2) This contains 4 discrete sections, looking at different aspects of Semi-Scheduled unit operation: Table 1 takes a look at Availability, Production and Curtailment Table 2 takes a look at the source of that Availability (including a row for use of MaxAvail in the bid) Table 3 takes a look at the use of participant self-forecasts (or defaults back to ASEFS/AWEFS) during periods of Semi-Dispatch Cap ; and Table 4 looks at (for those units utilising self-forecasts) the extent to which they have been suppressed … either: (a) Self-Suppressed (by the generator, the vendor, or their agents); or (b) Suppressed by the AEMO as discussed by Linton on 14th April 2023 . 3) Dan’s already published ‘ Keeping up with the curtailment: 3.7TWh of semi-scheduled economic and network curtailment estimated in 2023 ‘ on 7th March, utilising Table 1 in this report. So in this quick Sunday sideline, I’ve grabbed Table 2 from the Data Extract (which is an option for clients when they purchase the GSD2023 ) and focused in just on the ‘MaxAvail’ statistics across all Semi-Scheduled units for the months August to December 2023. With reference to this data, here’s some top-down insights … A 60% participation rate, over 5 months In this first chart we highlight (in green) the number of Semi-Scheduled DUIDs that utilised MaxAvail in the bid at least once in each month: The bar on the right is the aggregate result for the ~5 months in 2023 over which this possibility was a option. This shows 99 DUIDs out of 164 in total utilised this capability at least once over this period … that’s a 60% participation rate , which is nice to see for a change that’s relatively new, and was also quite low-key. A long tail of degree of utilisation Now let’s state up-front that it’s envisaged that Semi-Scheduled units would only need to utilise this capability occasionally … 1) With the default option being their self-forecasts (if they have one), or AEMO’s ASEFS or AWEFS processes. 2) So it was not really too much of a surprise to see a relatively low number of aggregate ‘DUID * hours’ trended in the chart above. In the chart below we’ve looked at all 164 DUIDs and the aggregate number of hours for each DUID over the ~5 month period that they utilised MaxAvail to set their availability in the bid. For comparison purposes, there were ~3,500 hours in total from the time the market change went live through until the end of the year: 1) So the DUIDs at the left end of the chart (especially the top one) were using MaxAvail almost 10% of the time … which does seem a surprise 2) And, for the curious people (like us) prompts follow-on questions about the specific circumstances of these units. Zooming into the top end of the chart, we see the following: There were 11 DUIDs above 100 hours, and another 23 DUIDs above 10 hours (but below 100). That leaves 130 DUIDs in a very long tail (i.e. below 10 hours, with 65 of these DUIDs at 0 hours over the ~5 months )! A tabulated list I don’t have time to delve further today (or in the coming days) but thought it would be useful to provide this tabular reference for all of the DUIDs sorted from top to bottom to make it easier to revisit later … or readers might like to do further analysis themselves… Cluster of Utilisation Details, and List The 11 DUIDs with utilisation >100 hours These are listed in rank order below: WANDSF1 = 305.9 hrs FLYCRKWF = 220.9 hrs KEPWF1 = 211.5 hrs BLUFF1 = 206.2 hrs COLEASF1 = 188.5 hrs NYNGAN1 = 180.1 hrs YARANSF1 = 165.6 hrs STWF1 = 158.1 hrs TBSF1 = 153.1 hrs SUNTPSF1 = 106.3 hrs KEPSF1 = 104.7 hrs The 23 DUIDs with utilisation >=10 hours (but below 100 hours) These are listed in rank order below: NBHWF1 = 99.7 hrs BROKENH1 = 90.6 hrs HALLWF1 = 79.7 hrs WPWF = 72.4 hrs BANN1 = 55.6 hrs LKBONNY2 = 52.2 hrs AVLSF1 = 46.5 hrs WYASF1 = 43.6 hrs MOORAWF1 = 41.4 hrs MTMILLAR = 35.4 hrs BULGANA1 = 30.8 hrs RYEPARK1 = 30.3 hrs MACARTH1 = 26. hrs HALLWF2 = 23.5 hrs LKBONNY1 = 23.2 hrs OAKEY1SF = 22.4 hrs BODWF1 = 20. hrs OAKLAND1 = 19.8 hrs MERCER01 = 15.3 hrs CTHLWF1 = 14. hrs MUWAWF1 = 11.1 hrs PAREPS1 = 11. hrs COHUNSF1 = 10. hrs The 65 DUIDs with non-zero utilisation (but below 10 hours) These are listed in rank order here (but numbers are not provided, in order to condense the list): GULLRWF1, PAREPW1, LKBONNY3, HVWWPV1, MUSSELR1, BALDHWF1, GANGARR1, SMCSF1, KIAMSF1, WOODLWN1, BANGOWF2, MUWAWF2, DULAWF1, SNOWTWN1, WDGPH1, CNUNDAWF, RUGBYR1, MRTLSWF1, KIATAWF1, BOCORWF1, NUMURSF1, ADPPV1, BLUEGSF1, HDWF1, HDWF3, WEMENSF1, NEWENSF1, GULLRWF2, SRSF1, ARWF1, WGWF1, BOWWPV1, GRANWF1, LGAPWF1, GLENSF1, HDWF2, CRURWF1, MWPS2PV1, JUNEESF1, SEBSF1, COOPGWF1, COLUMSF1, GULLRSF1, YENDWF1, EMERASF1, CHILDSF1, MWPS3PV1, HAYMSF1, LGAPWF2, NEWENSF2, KARSF1, PARSF1, WATERLWF, BNGSF2, CHYTWF1, JEMALNG1, KABANWF1, NEVERSF1, BANGOWF1, CRWASF1, CSPVPS1, MTGELWF1, SNOWNTH1, WINTSF1, WRSF1, The 65 DUIDs with no utilisation at all These are listed in alphabetical order below (as they are all ranked the same, being 0 hours): BERYLSF1, BNGSF1, BOMENSF1, BRYB1WF1, BRYB2WF2, CATHROCK, CLARESF1, CLEMGPWF, CLERMSF1, COLWF01, CROOKWF2, CROWLWF1, DARLSF1, DAYDSF1, DDSF1, DUNDWF1, DUNDWF2, DUNDWF3, EDENVSF1, ELAINWF1, FINLYSF1, GANNSF1, GLRWNSF1, GNNDHSF1, GOONSF1, GUNNING1, HAMISF1, HAUGHT11, HILLSTN1, KSP1, LILYSF1, LIMOSF11, LIMOSF21, MANSLR1, MAPS2PV1, MAPS3PV1, MARYRSF1, MBPS2PV1, METZSF1, MEWF1, MIDDLSF1, MOLNGSF1, MOREESF1, MOUSF1, MWPS1PV1, MWPS4PV1, OAKEY2SF, RRSF1, SALTCRK1, SAPHWF1, SNOWSTH1, STARHLWF, STOCKYD1, SUNRSF1, TARALGA1, TB2SF1, WAGGNSF1, WARWSF1, WARWSF2, WELLSF1, WHITSF1, WOOLGSF1, WRWF1, WSTWYSF1, YATSF1, That’s all for now!",

    "title": "Need for speed: How long has each battery project in the NEM taken to deliver?",
    "date": "15-03-2024 11:42:00 AM",
    "content": "Many will remember the ‘100 days or its free’ offer between Elon Musk and Mike Cannon-Brookes back in 2017. That exchange was almost exactly 7 years ago – back when Mike Cannon-Brookes was merely an energy spectator, and Elon Musk was merely a Twitter user. Much has happened since then.. The Hornsdale Power Reserve was indeed installed within the 100 days , although it took roughly 11 months for the project to go from ‘tweet’ to full operations. Also since then, the NEM’s battery fleet has grown from that original lone big battery, to a total of twenty registered systems with a combined power capacity of 1,632 MW and an energy storage capacity of 2,405 MWh. Last week I published a short review of the financial performance for those twenty batteries over 2023 , which I composed largely using data from our GSD2023 released several weeks beforehand . In the second part here I have decided to explore the development timelines of each of these projects, to understand the historical speed of delivery. Given the ‘100 days’ promise that kicked off the battery boom, and which no doubt sticks in the minds of many, we wondered about how true delivery times for each subsequent BESS project compared. A timeline of BESS development in the NEM With a bit of detective work, I have compiled a list of key development milestones for each of the twenty batteries currently registered in the NEM, and have attempted to plot them on the Gantt chart shown below. For these projects, companies traditionally post press releases when a battery ‘completes construction’ or ‘enters commissioning phase’ or ‘reaches energisation’ – these milestones often reflect terms set within contracts. Far less reported is the date when each battery is fully operational, which is thus the time from which it can be relied upon for system security (and when companies can expect ongoing market revenue). A Gantt chart of battery development in the NEM, using definitions below. Click here to see a higher-resolution version of the chart. Source: GSD2023 Data Extract, NEMreview. Other sources are stated in the table below. In the Gantt chart above I have used my own definitions for consistency: First Announcement: Marks the date that the company first publicly unveiled the project. Feasibility studies, contract negotiations and detailed design work typically begin before this point in time. This is a notable milestone as it is a signal of when the market, and system planners generally start to anticipate the project. FC : Date of Financial Close or Final Investment Decision for the project, or in the case of Government-initiated contracts, the date when ‘notice to proceed’ was given. Construction and Early Commissioning: For this analysis, this period begins from the first announcement of construction commencing (i.e. ground broken), and ends at the time when ‘Partial Operation’ (defined below) begins. Partial Operation : Begins from the date of first power output or input via AEMO’s MMS. I have used our NEMreview software to examine the InitialMW data field here. Full Operation: Marks when the battery’s generation or load DUID maximum daily availability was at its full capacity for more than half of a calendar month. Or where more appropriate, the first month of material FCAS bidding. I have used our GSD2023 data extract to determine these dates. Further, I will also caveat the chart above with the following points: The timeline is indicative only. The source of references for each date is presented in the table below. Due to the definitions above, partial operation period is likely to overlap actual construction periods in some cases. Project expansions (e.g. the 2020 expansion of Hornsdale) are not included in the timeline. Using the definitions stated above, I have also charted the length of each project’s development time, by two measures, counted in an approximate number of months. Project delivery times for each BESS (in approximate number of months). Source: GSD2023 Data Extract. Other sources stated in table below. It should be obvious that COVID and post-COVID supply chain constraints played some role in project delivery times, although one might expect (or hope) this to be diminishing over time. From the two charts above, there are a few observations that stand out to me: Hornsdale was an (extreme) outlier in terms of speed of delivery. Project delivery times vary significantly – even between projects that were developed by the same company. The quickest projects, particularly those of scale, had significant state government or TNSP involvement (e.g. Hornsdale, VIC Big Battery, etc.) In the case of some conjoined projects, Bulgana especially – delays and slowness of delivery can be somewhat attributed to the battery being built in tandem with a wind or solar farm, as development risk is likely to increase with project scale and complexity. This is an important factor going forward as we are seeing a significant increase in hybrid projects.

    "title": "Three recent news media articles about the replacement of (and/or short term delay to closure of) Eraring Power Station",
    "date": "09-03-2024 04:48:00 PM",
    "content": "In recent weeks we’ve noted ongoing discussion with respect to the closure of Eraring Power Station . In particular were these three separate articles in various locations – which we’ve noted together here in order to provide an easier future point of reference for us: On Fri 1st March in the AFR = ‘Eraring closure ‘tall order’ as plant underpins supply in heat spike’ First of this particular three to be published was the article ‘Eraring closure ‘tall order’ as plant underpins supply in heat spike’ written by Angela MacDonald-Smith just over a week ago (Fri 1st March 2024) in the AFR. As highlighted on the image, this article from Angela referenced our earlier WattClarity article ‘So how much did Eraring Power Station supply, of the NSW electricity consumption, at peak demand time on Thursday 29th February 2024?’ published that same day. Our article referenced, in turn, the earlier AFR article ‘Power market in the dark as negotiations over Eraring drag on’ from Wednesday evening 28th Feb 2023. On Thu 7th March in the Australian = ‘Origin, NSW government negotiate delay to coal-fired Eraring power station’s closure ’ Second in the list, published two days ago (Thu 7th March 2024) was Colin Packham’s article ‘Origin, NSW government negotiate delay to coal-fired Eraring power station’s closure’ in the Australian: As noted on the image above, some of the wording in the article might be read to imply that the extension to service has been signed in some agreement between the NSW Government and Origin Energy … but I don’t believe that is the case (yet?). On Fri 8th March in RenewEconomy = ‘How new wind, solar and batteries would keep lights on in NSW heatwave, even without Eraring ’ Then yesterday (Fri 8th March 2024), Giles Parkinson wrote ‘How new wind, solar and batteries would keep lights on in NSW heatwave, even without Eraring’ in RenewEconomy: In this article, Giles writes: ‘Many energy analysts argue that such extensions – and costs – are not necessary, particularly if all the planned projects currently under construction are delivered in time. And to emphasise that point, they have released new analysis on what would have happened on February 29, when the temperature gauge jumped up to 41°C, and the searing heat didn’t just break electricity demand levels, they smashed them.’ … and includes a chart that purports to demonstrate that … ‘The analysis shows that the near five gigawatts of new renewables will push that yawning gap back into the later afternoon by around 2 hours until 4pm, and significantly reduce the scale of the gap it until after 7pm (see bright orange line). These new renewables will comprise six big solar farms, including Stubbo, New England 2, and the newly contracted Culcairn project, totalling 2.4 GW, plus three new wind farms totalling 820 MW, including Uungala, Flyers Creek and Coppabella. There will also be an estimated 1.7 GW more rooftop solar. The rest of the energy gap (in grey blocks) is filled by dispatchable generation, firstly by the newly commissioned 320 MW Tallawarra B gas plant owned by EnergyAustralia, and the 660 MW Kurri Kurri gas generator currently being built by Snowy Hydro. In blue, there will also be eight new batteries totalling 2.5 GW and 6.5 GWh, including the massive Waratah Super battery at 850 MW and 1650 MWh, the 415 MW, four hour Orana battery , the 500 MW, two hour Liddell battery and the 460 MW, two hour Eraring battery. The list also includes the country’s, and probably the world’s, first eight hour battery, the 50 MW, 400 MWh Limondale facility to be built by German energy giant RWE. And there will be capacity from virtual power plants, including 90 MW from a newly contracted project put forward by EnelX , and a promised 826 MW increase from Origin’s own efforts to boost its VPP capacity, called Origin loop.’ I’ve inferred that the article (it’s not 100% clear) that the analysts who have released this ‘new analysis’ include both: 1) Tim Buckley (from Climate Energy Finance) and 2) Stephanie Bashir (from Nexa Advisory) 3) And perhaps others? With respect to these two, it’s worth noting that: 1) We’d earlier noted on 19th Jan 2024 that ‘Clean Energy Finance analysis says Eraring does not need to be extended’ … so we presume that analysis had been updated/extended with respect to 29th Feb 2024. 2) In an opinion piece in the AFR on Tue 5th March 2024, Stephanie Bashir had written ‘The lights will stay on in NSW when Eraring is turned off’ , and has been quite vocal on social media, as well 3) I’ve had a very quick search, but can’t find a direct link to this new analysis . I’ve also noted that some of these new firming projects were the 6 x Firming Projects noted ( highlighted above ) in this media release from the NSW Department of Energy on 22nd November 2023 , which noted that these projects were targeting an operational date of December 2025. … nothing further, at this point.",

    "title": "Cloud impacts on demand, a review of NSW on 29 February 2024",
    "date": "08-03-2024 01:52:00 PM",
    "content": "It was the hottest day of the month in NSW on Thursday 29 February 2024. Demand levels stretched the grid and exceeded forecast expectations. Inner Sydney recorded 39.6 °C at Canterbury Racecourse and high dew point temperatures compounded the uncomfortable conditions. There was a distinct and unusual jump in demand between 14:30 and 15:00. This article delves into the extent to which cloud impacts caused the jump. Background Days ahead of Thursday, the demand forecasts were already indicating high demand levels. Lack of reserve conditions (at level 2) were consistently being projected with each new forecast run. NSW ‘ Market Demand ’ peaked at 13,764MW (in the 16:35 dispatch interval). Yet it was 885MW below the all-time record (of 14,649MW – which occurred on 1st February 2011 ). Nonetheless, the peak came as somewhat of a surprise as demand forecasts had projected lower demand in the lead-up on the day. Preceding the peak, a jump in demand occurred in the half-hour to 15:00. To many market watchers in NSW the sight of higher than expected demand might have triggered additional sweating! As indicated in the chart above, there was a distinct and unusual jump in demand between 14:30 and 15:00. Déjà vu, hadn’t we seen this feature earlier? It was on 22 February in VIC where we saw a similar demand feature. Market demand actuals were landing far above prior P30 forecasts in Victoria on 22nd February 2024 [ WattClarity ]. On that day a keen-eyed reader attributed the jump to bushfire smoke. And indeed later posts and articles about the day supported the explanation. Supported by satellite and radar imagery from Weatherzone, Dan Lee’s post It appears bushfire smoke was negatively impacting rooftop PV production in a material way in Victoria yesterday provided a great overview. In this Victorian case, the jump in demand was attributed to the smoke (mixed with cloud) reducing the sunshine (solar irradiance) hitting solar panels. The drop in output from rooftop PV (being the predominant style of PV in greater Melbourne) meant more energy needed to come from the grid, from market generators. But there weren’t any smoke plumes that we are aware of that could have caused reduced rooftop PV in NSW on February 29. Yet there was cloud cover. In NSW on the 29 th , the observed 30-minute jump in demand is verified in the 5-minute data With a focus between 14:30 and 15:00. The key 5-minute interval appears to be 14:35. Further, AEMO’s operational forecasting systems make an educated estimate of actual rooftop PV. Although at 30-minute cadence, this dataset shows the dip at the same time period as the spike. Did the Russ Christ Effect contribute? The Russ Christ Effect can be described as cloud impacts on rooftop PV arriving before any associated cooling conditions. It was Professor Paul Simshauser’s (CEO Powerlink Queensland) presentation at the Queensland Energy Club on Wednesday 16 th February 2022, where he brought this to our attention and referred to it as the “Russ Christ effect”. We first referred to this in the WattClarity article looking at Queensland’s heatwave week in 2022 . To consider this, we’ve captured a series of satellite images for the period between 14:00 and 14:50. The key period we are interested in is between 14:30 and 14:40 because it was at 14:35 when the jump in 5-minute demand was most pronounced. The area captured focuses on Greater Sydney (boundary drawn) and extends: To Canberra in the south (boundary drawn), Dubbo in the north-west corner, Taree in the north along the coastline (coastlines drawn), and Includes Greater Sydney in the middle (boundary also drawn). Observations and Context Sun position At this time of day (14:30 UTC+10) in February: If you were standing in Penrith (suburb west of Sydney) it would be about 48 degrees (roughly halfway to vertical) above the horizon, and gradually lowering. The sun (azimuth) would be positioned towards the west-north-west (30 degrees northwards of west), gradually moving further around to the west as it sets. This means shadows would be projected from clouds in the west and northwest. General weather situation The title of WeatherZone ’s article, from the last day in February in NSW, says it all: A “ Sweaty, stormy end to Sydney’s third hottest summer on record ”. The article goes on to note that there was a lot more atmospheric moisture than usual in summer 2023-24. This helped produce rain and storms including the storms in and around Sydney on the final day of the season. Cloud movement From the satellite sequence (source Himawari ) : 14:00 We see a large patch of cloud in the west and north west of Greater Sydney. As time progresses this moves towards the north east. 14:10 Within Greater Sydney the northern portion is cloud-free. There are some small clusters of cloud and wispy types (cirrus?) in the south. 14:30 The large patch of cloud had moved northward. This would have started to cast shadow on western parts of Greater Sydney. Two small but pronounced cloud systems had appeared indicating thunderstorms were emerging. The southern one appeared to be over Badgerys Creek. The northern one appears to be over Maroota. 14:40 The two thunderstorms had increased in size. The large patch of cloud out side Greater Sydney was aligned at 30 degrees (north of west) with Sydney. It had broadened in area. It’s position meant the cloud had moved directly into the path of sunshine towards Sydney. It seems the north-west cloud band that had started outside of Greater Sydney in the west, had moved northward into the sun’s path for most of Sydney by 13:40. Depending on the cloud elevation, its shadow would have extended into Greater Sydney even though the cloud itself hadn’t materially crossed the Greater Sydney boundary. Two thunderstorms that emerged around the same time would have helped reduce solar irradiances. Temperatures The Russ Christ Effect requires the shadows to emerge before the cooling. If we inspect temperatures at Penrith (west of Sydney) and Canterbury Racecourse (inner Sydney) we can see how the cool change took longer to reach Penrith. Conclusions While we haven’t had time to cover every geographical corner of the region nor the full suite of atmospheric aspects of the day, we have uncovered many indicators pointing towards another example of the Russ Christ Effect. To recap The spike in demand (market demand aka ‘total demand’) is primarily attributed to a drop in rooftop PV. There was indeed a drop in rooftop PV over the same time period. A large cloud band had moved into the line of the sun, and coincided with the time when rooftop PV output declined. At the time of the drop in rooftop PV, cooling effects of the weather system had not yet reached key areas of Greater Sydney that would likely have been shaded by the cloud band. Yet, two thunderstorms that emerged around the same time would have contributed to reduced solar irradiances and rooftop PV.

    "date": "08-03-2024 10:15:00 AM",
    "content": "Whilst we have the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view powered up, it’s useful to tighten the time range (from MT PASA here to ST PASA in this article) to take a look at forecasts for ‘ Market Demand ’ in South Australia over the coming long weekend. The reason for the interest is that we’re looking at some hot weather in SA and VIC for the coming long weekend in both locations. here’s temperature forecasts via a Google search for Adelaide: Related to this I have seen this morning: 1) Joel Pippard at Weatherzone writes ‘Tropics helping add to southern Aus heatwave’ this morning. 2) On ABC yesterday, Harvey Biggs writes ‘Warning to South Australians not to ‘scrimp and save’ on electricity during weekend heatwave’ … an unfortunate reminder of cost of living pressures (and how, especially for some, they overlay on top of debate about this energy transition ). Back to the the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view , however, and in this view I have flipped to ‘chart’ and show two data series – on the top being forecasts for ‘ Market Demand ’ in South Australia, and on the bottom AEMO’s forecasts for UIGF (i.e the ‘Unconstrained Intermittent Generation Forecast’ ) for all Wind Farms in the region: As we see, the evening peaks in ‘ Market Demand ’ are forecasts to coincide with low points in what looks to be a diurnal cycle in wind output over this time. For rooftop PV and the few Large Solar Farms in SA, they would obviously be trending down to sunset at this time, as well. Note the ‘ Market Demand ’ forecasts are up around 2,800MW on all three days noted: 1) Which is still a ways below the all-time record of 3,402MW set in January 2011; 2) But notable all the same because of the very ‘peaky’ nature of the ‘ Market Demand ’ shape that means it does not get this high very often at all (won’t have been this high since 23rd Feb 2023).

    "date": "08-03-2024 09:21:00 AM",
    "content": "Saw that Antony Stace asked this question here on LinkedIn today : Without going all the way to provide a complete answer to the question, thought it would be useful to provide some quick additional context using the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view , focused on 3 years of history of AEMO’s successive forecasts for QLD’s ‘ Market Demand ’ in the following grid: Frequent readers will recall that: 1) You should click on the image to open as a larger resolution image in another browser tab; and that 2) In this widget, each successive row upwards is a more recent forecast run , meaning that you can ‘ look up a vertical ’ to view ‘that other dimension of time’ . The ‘zoomed in’ image above clearly shows the step change (downwards) that Antony is asking about … but also that there was a very similar step change upwards some months earlier (Aug 2023). Zooming further out in the image below, we also see three earlier step changes (Sept 2022, April 2022 and Aug 2021): I’m not going to fall into the trap of trying to find what I believe will be on the AEMO website somewhere (as it’s truly a rabbit hole that can suck an hour of one’s time without finding the results), but my guess is that each of those 5 x clear horizontal stripes corresponded with the release of some updated assumptions for demand forecasts (e.g. as part of the ESOO or ISP modelling processes). Note that the horizontal strips are in Aug-Sept each year, plus sometimes ~ half a year after that. Exactly what the change was that saw the ~500MW drop in forecasted demand in QLD, however, I do not know . Perhaps one of our readers can help Antony?",

    "date": "07-03-2024 05:42:00 PM",
    "content": "In the latest edition of our Generator Statistical Digest, we introduced a new section that specifically focuses on Semi-Scheduled Wind and Solar units . There are some notable exceptions (with a few units still being Non-Scheduled ), but by and large, the Semi-Scheduled category represents almost all solar and wind farms in the NEM with a capacity greater or equal to 30MW. A sample from the new semi-scheduled section of our GSD2023 which shows monthly summary stats related to production, curtailment, availability, and self-forecasting for each of these units. Source: GSD2023 Two new metrics we’ve begun publishing in this section are ‘Curtailed Network’ and ‘Curtailed Economic’ volumes (in MWh) for each of these units month-by-month. The calculations for estimating and attributing curtailment are not straightforward, as Marcelle Gannon previously noted on WattClarity back in 2020. However, the methodology we settled on for the GSD2023 uses a logic resembling what Allan O’Neil outlined in this WattClarity article last year – which we believe is the most practically accurate method of estimation, and especially so when aggregating over time. To avoid doubling up on information, I would suggest reading Allan’s very informative article to understand the difference between network and economic ‘curtailment’ – and to make more sense of the broader terminology. The GSD2023 data extract makes easy work of summing together all these unit-level numbers to see a bigger picture of NEM-wide semi-scheduled curtailment. My simple calculations reveal the following grand totals: 39.7TWh of Energy Production 1.2TWh of Network Curtailment 2.5TWh of Economic Curtailment 108.2TWh of Unavailability In the chart below I’ve plotted each of those underlying numbers on a month-by-month basis and translated each into factors. Month-by-month production (green), network curtailment (red), economic curtailment (orange), and unavailability (grey) for all semi-scheduled units – expressed as factors in relation to total capacity. Note: Y-axis is capped at 50%, this has been done to zoom in on curtailment figures. Source: GSD2023 Data Extract It’s dangerous to draw concrete conclusions to the underlying reasons when only looking at numbers aggregated NEM-wide, but the chart reveals some seasonal variations in those factors. Worst Hit Zooming back in to the unit-level data – as we originally published it – reveals the more extreme individual outcomes beneath those aggregated numbers. There were 164 semi-scheduled units by the end of 2023, and with some quick spreadsheet work I created a simple ranking of the 3 worst hit, in terms of a ‘network curtailment factor’. As mentioned above, I’m using this term to refer to a metric that is just a simple expression of MWh network curtailed normalised against the size of solar/wind farm unit. Coming in at the top of the rankings were Molong SF (10.4% network curtailment factor), Manildra SF (8.9%), and Bannerton Solar Park (8.8%). The full figures are shown in the screenshot below. The ‘top 3’ semi-scheduled units with the highest network curtailment factor. Source: GSD2023 Interestingly, it jumps out to me that Molong Solar Farm was network-curtailed for more MWh than it produced in 2023.. But perhaps this is less surprising for those who read Paul’s review of curtailment early last year where 2022 outcomes were just as similarly dire for Molong and Manildra. Using a similar ‘economic curtailment factor’, the ‘top 3’ comprised of Numurkah SF (10.4%), Whitsundays SF (9%), and Clare SF (8.8%). The screenshot below reveals the underlying data. The ‘top 3’ semi-scheduled units with the highest economic curtailment factor. Source: GSD2023 Interestingly when I look further down my rankings list, I note that the ‘top 10’ for both of these metrics comprised solely of solar farms. That’s all for now.. As time allows I hope to dig a bit deeper into these numbers to examine locational trends and the underlying factors at play.",

(Part 1)’ with respect to a shift to ‘Fixed Load’ bidding apparently to manage some sort of fatigue damage issue in the High Pressure Bypass Valve Pipework (HPBV Pipework) for the unit: This week two things have happened independently: 1) Yesterday whilst having an online discussion with someone about our ez2view software, I noticed a large drop in output from one of the 350MW units at the Stanwell corporation that appeared to have been a ‘tip to house load’ (i.e. TTHL) test at the time. I did not think any more about it, until … 2) Today I’ve been tagged into a discussion amongst some WattClarity readers and clients with respect to what others have been looking at, in relation to ongoing bidding as Fixed Load. Not remembering which of the 8 x 350MW units it was that performed the test yesterday, I opened up the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view and started at unit STAN-1. Hey presto, this was the one , as we see here: With respected to the numbered annotations: 1) We see the unit drop: (a) down to 15MW (i.e. the ‘house load’ for the unit, to cover essential auxiliary services) at the 10:25 dispatch interval … in the process shifting volume out of ‘Fixed Load’ and to the –$1,000/MWh bid band at the RRN; and then (b) Rise again to 365MW at the 13:00 dispatch interval … increase in output was actually shortly later (i.e. following ramp rates), the 13:00 period was when volume was allocated there. (c) Before dropping back to 200MW (from 15:35) and back to Fixed Load bidding (from 19:35). (d) Why this is of particular interest is that the TTHL test (if my rusty memory serves me correctly) requires the use of the same HPBV pipework that’s subject to fatigue concerns the past couple of months … so I am curious about the reasons for the test at this time (e.g. perhaps mandatory at the AEMO)? 2) Most of the 14-day look-back period shows the unit output consistently at the ‘Fixed Load’ level of 200MW bid. 3) But we do see some periods (like Fri 23rd February highlighted, but also Mon 26th Feb and Thu 29th Feb 2023 ) where the unit increased its output, under increased volume in Fixed Load bids, in conjunction with the price spikes.

    "title": "State-of-charge: a peek into the economics and performances within the NEM’s battery fleet",
    "date": "06-03-2024 09:34:00 AM",
    "content": "2023 was the year of the big battery in the NEM. The year started with ten batteries registered in the market and ended with a doubling to twenty, with no signs of a slowdown. We saw a doubling of the NEM’s battery fleet throughout 2023 Note: Hornsdale Power Reserve originally had a maximum capacity of 100MW when registered in 2017, but this was expanded to 150MW in 2020. Only showing batteries with MW capacity equal to or greater than 10MW. Our team has had a growing interest in batteries since the beginning of the current development boom – a surge that can be traced back to that infamous Elon Musk tweet . With the 2023 edition of Generator Statistical Digest published a little over three weeks ago, its release provided me with the opportunity to dissect what the market data is revealing about the battery storage boom. To begin, I’ve charted the long-term monthly revenue for all batteries in the NEM, breaking down ‘market revenue’ by source. The chart begins with the first output of Hornsdale Power Reserve back in November 2017. Aggregated Monthly Spot and FCAS Revenue for all big batteries in the NEM Note: Only aggregated for batteries with MW capacity equal to or greater than 10MW. Based on 5-min InitialMW data. Source: GSD2023 Data Extract Looking at the chart above, three key long-term trends stand out to me: The obvious long-term upward trend of total market revenue largely owing to the increase in the number of batteries entering the NEM. The increasing trend of energy revenue as a more equal share of market revenue, particularly from early 2022 onwards. Three key unexpected events have played a significant role in market revenue upside for batteries thus far – the SA islanding in late January 2020 , the Energy Crisis of June 2022 , and the second major SA islanding in November 2022 . I also see that the last two bars in the chart demonstrate the early returns from the new 1 Sec Contingency markets since their introduction last October – but the sample size is too small to conclusively determine whether its introduction has contributed to a material uplift in total battery market revenue. Revenue outcomes and individual performances Here, I’ll discuss revenue in three parts: Arbitrage. This is the net result of what we would refer to as ‘Spot Revenue’ or ‘Energy Revenue’ in the NEM – and it’s simply calculated as the price paid for charging minus the price received for discharging in the energy market. FCAS. Revenue from providing enablement into any of the 10 Regulation or Contingency Frequency Control markets . Capacity and other. SIPS/WAPS revenue, bespoke contracts, and other accounted value derived from the dispatchable capacity or other services that the battery provides. But before looking into individual financial performance through these three streams, it’s worth first reminding our readers how the design characteristics of each battery, and contracted financial positions, play a role in revenue strategy. Firstly, duration can play a significant role in how the operators bid their volume between the energy market and FCAS market as the fleet itself is made up of batteries of different shapes and sizes. Capacity, duration, and reported construction cost of each big battery currently registered in the NEM. Note: Hornsdale Power Reserve originally had a maximum capacity of 100MW when registered in 2017, but this was expanded to 150MW in 2020. Only showing fully scheduled batteries with a maximum capacity greater than or equal to 10MW. Capacity of generation DUID only. Sources are listed in the references below. In the chart below, we can see that being designed with a very short duration in the two most extreme examples (Dalrymple and Ballarat) plays a significant role in how their energy and FCAS bids are targeted. Split of Spot (Arbitrage) vs FCAS revenue provides some signal of trading strategies for each battery. Note: Arbitrage based on 5-min InitialMW data. Source: GSD2023 Data Extract We can see a range of Spot-FCAS revenue splits for 2023. I’ve faded those batteries that spent time in commissioning throughout 2023 as it’s common for batteries to trade in energy before FCAS during their commissioning phase. Hence those revenue splits are unlikely to be indicative of long-term strategy. It’s also worth noting that we are yet to see any batteries enter the market with more than two hours of duration. All current batteries are considered to be relatively ‘shallow’, which largely confines them to arbitrage intraday price spreads only. I’ve previously written on WattClarity about this, and the weak price signal for duration in the NEM’s current energy-only market design. Of course, arbitrage and FCAS are not the only revenue sources for some batteries, as I will discuss below. Unfortunately, however, they are the only two where we have transparency. Another aspect that we don’t have full transparency over is any revenue protections that would insulate revenue below a certain baseline, for example: Through private hedging arrangements, such as the 8-year offtake agreement between Genex’s Bouldercombe BESS and Tesla – which provides the battery with an undisclosed revenue floor. Or through more formalised means such as the LTESA products or incoming CIS , although it will be some months/years before we see the first batteries connect covered by those arrangements. Arbitrage Below is a simple plot of arbitrage revenue for each battery per MW of installed (maximum) capacity, ranked highest to lowest. Batteries in Victoria underperformed on an arbitrage revenue per MW of installed capacity basis. Note: Arbitrage based on 5-min InitialMW data. Source: GSD2023 Data Extract By this simple metric, the 25MW Lake Bonney BESS came out on top by a fair margin. But also notably, I must highlight the relative underperformance of batteries in Victoria. One significant contributing factor was the lack of ‘high-high’ prices in the region throughout 2023. We’ve extracted data from our GSD to put together the chart below which shows how effective each battery was at discharging during periods of extremely high prices. The column on the right shows the total time that the battery was able to be exposed to a price above $10,000/MWh. For batteries that entered the market part-way through the year, the time shown is measured since the interval of first bid, hence factors are relative to time spent in the market. Capacity factor of each battery (for discharging) when prices were above $10,000/MWh Note: Generation DUID of each battery only. Source: GSD2023 Data Extract So whilst Bulgana and Hazelwood were relatively effective at capturing these ‘high-high’ prices, VIC only experienced 15 minutes of such prices throughout 2023. Meanwhile, SA experienced 4 hours and 50 minutes of this level of extreme prices in 2023, of which Lake Bonney BESS was able to discharge more than half of its maximum capacity during these periods. This would be one of the significant factors in starting to explain the battery’s arbitrage overperformance. In the chart above I’d also note that a low availability factor suggests that each of these batteries was not in a position to discharge during these price spikes. This could be for a number of reasons such as: being capped by duration, commissioning, FCAS enablements, auto-bidding algorithm, pre-IESS dispatch limitations, or capacity obligations such as those faced by the VIC Big Battery and Hornsdale Power Reserve (as will be discussed later). FCAS Below we see FCAS revenue combined for these 10 markets for each battery, per MW of maximum capacity. The more FCAS-inclined Ballarat BESS delivered the most combined FCAS revenue per MW of installed capacity. Source: GSD2023 Data Extract The smaller batteries were at the top of this list with Ballarat, Queanbeyan, and Lake Bonney in the ‘top 3’ – noting that the latter two batteries also achieved the third highest and highest arbitrage revenue per MW of capacity, respectively. As we generally see less price separation between regions for FCAS prices (in normal times) – there was not the same regional divide for FCAS revenue throughout 2023 as what we saw in Arbitrage revenue. The chart below provides further context, showing a breakdown of this FCAS revenue into the three main categories. The breakdown of FCAS revenue sources for each battery, where we see lower contingency made up the lowest share on average. Source: GSD2023 Data Extract Interestingly, we can see that lower contingency revenue was fairly low across the board. This was due, at least in part, to relatively less volatile and softer prices (particularly in June and July) for these FCAS services across the NEM. Capacity and Other With the lack of a formal capacity mechanism in the NEM, we only get small glances at how batteries can use their capacity to generate revenue (or add portfolio value). This often comes via press releases or news articles, which are rarely heavy on details or contract terms. But it’s thought that this revenue source can be material. As an example, three weeks ago I noted that AGL’s half-year results presentation suggested that somewhere near 70% to 80% of the apparent revenue derived from their Torrens Island BESS in FY24H1 was attributed to ‘capacity and portfolio benefits’. For completeness, it’s worth a quick review of what these revenue sources may include, with some known examples. Support agreements These are agreements between the owner/operator of the battery with the transmission service provider, government, and/or the AEMO – such as the System Integrity Protection Scheme (SIPS) or the Wide Area Protection Scheme (WAPS). There are at least three batteries that have reportedly been contracted under SIPS or WAPS – the Hornsdale Power Reserve , the Dalrypme BESS , and the Victorian Big Battery . The service delivered is specific to each of those contracts – but in return, a fixed revenue is paid for reserving some amount of the battery’s capacity. In the case of the Victorian Big Battery, 250MW of its 300MW capacity is contracted to be reserved between November 1st to March 31st every summer from 2021 to 2032. They are paid $12.5 million per year (adjusted for inflation) for this service. And this obligation limits their ability to generate energy or FCAS revenue during those periods. The shape of VIC Big Battery’s output over 2023 shows the effect of its SIPS obligations . Source: GSD2023 From using ez2view to review rebid explanations, I can see that the battery undertook a brief ‘Dynamic SIPS trial’ in late Feb 2023 for one week where their capacity available to the energy market temporarily increased. Curiously, I have also noted the load component of the battery doesn’t appear to be capacity-limited for summer 2023/24 thus far. But we have yet to have the time to fully investigate this. Hornsdale originally signed a 10-year/$40m contract in 2017 under SIPS, but it was reported that this was superseded by an undisclosed contract in late 2020. Virtual Caps Particularly for a generator with retail exposure, a battery can be utilised in place of a traditional cap contract. Hence the owner can potentially attribute the value of this foregone cost as capacity revenue. In early 2020, UQ ran (and documented) a case study experimenting with this concept , albeit on a 1.1MW scale. As Andrew Wilson noted in that WattClairty article, a ‘virtual cap’ is not a pure like-for-like replacement for a traditional cap as a battery can face physical limitations (e.g. being limited by duration, network constraints, etc.) whereas a financial derivative does not. It’s less clear how this additional risk is managed in practice. Other There are many other ways a battery can generate revenue or add value to a portfolio, to name just a few more: Through sales of bespoke cap-like contracts or other OTC products to other market participants or to large customers directly. Reducing FCAS Causer Pays costs across a portfolio. This was one of the key objectives originally behind Iberdrola’s development of the Lake Bonney BESS . Reducing curtailment of other owned generation assets. This was a key benefit listed in the ARENA grant summary for the Gannawarra BESS . Increasing portfolio flexibility, hence assisting in lowering fuel costs for other slower ramping generation within a portfolio. Key Takeaways This article is just a brief skim on the surface of generator performance – believe us, we just published an 1180-page book of statistics about each one.. However, there should be a couple of high-level takeaways from this review: Battery revenue streams are continuing to increase in diversity. The split between arbitrage and FCAS has shown signs of evening out, but beyond that, there are signals that batteries are generating more holistic value. Market extremes play a very outsized role in overall financial performance. As we often emphasize, the NEM is a very volatile market hence averages are becoming less relevant.

    "date": "04-03-2024 01:49:00 PM",
    "content": "I’ve come across articles on RenewEconomy and PV Magazine this morning reporting that ASX-listed Genex Power minority shareholder J-Power has put in a $380m takeover bid for the company. As of lunchtime today: I see the share market has priced in the news with a 32.4% increase since previous trading day to 24c/share – which is just a touch below the 27.5c/share which J-Power will reportedly offer. I also saw this ASX Announcement ‘Genex receives non-binding, indicative and conditional proposal from J-Power’ from earlier today. In light of this news, and the release of their half-year results approximately one week ago , I thought this would be a good chance to examine the market performance of the company’s three operating assets (four DUIDs) through our recently released GSD2023 . Genex is listed as the owner of these four DUIDs currently operating in the NEM. Source: GSD2023 The company also has four other projects in the development pipeline in: the Kidston 2 Solar Project (250MW), the Kidston Wind Project (258MW), Kidston Pumped Hydro (250MW/2,000MWh), and the Bulli Creek Solar and BESS (Up to 2GW). Market performance of operating assets Jemalong SF operates on a fully or near-fully merchant basis whilst Kidston SF is thought to be more protected against low prices through their 20-year offtake agreement with the Queensland government. The Bouldercombe BESS meanwhile has an 8-year offtake agreement with Tesla who provide a revenue floor, and upside is shared at a fixed rate between the two parties. Below we can see the market revenue totals of these four DUIDS broken into Energy, FCAS Regulation, FCAS Raise Contingency, and FCAS Lower Contingency. Throghout 2023, Jemalong SF delivered the highest share of market revenue for the company’s portfolio. Source: GSD2023 The Bouldercombe BESS only began operating in the market around July/August 2023 and does not look like it ramped up to full or near-full production until the end the calendar year. From this table, we can see that the battery (net of its generation and load DUIDs) generated more spot revenue than either solar farm for the month of December. Focusing in on the two solar farms, in the chart below we can see each unit’s price capture relative to the regional reference price. The charts on the left show production (dark purple), availability (light purple), and unavailability (white) volumes for each time when the energy spot price fell within those defined bands. The chart on the right shows the same data but expressed as capacity factor (dark purple), availability factor (light purple) and unavailability factor (white). In 2023, Kidston Solar Farm faced (and harvested) a higher volume of negative prices than Jemalong. Source: GSD2023 In the case of Jemalong SF, it is worth noting how these charts compare to 2022. Roughly one year ago I posted an article that contained the same chart for Jemalong’s price capture from our then-current GSD (the 2022 edition). The charts show a similar shape in terms of price capture, but notable is the much higher incidence of negative prices in the unit’s region – in 2022 there were 245 hours and 5 minutes when prices were below -$1/MWh, compared to 538 hours and 15 minutes in 2023. For Kidston (located in the QLD region) this feature was even more extreme with 1,164 hours and 5 minutes where prices were below -$1/MWh.",

    "title": "A long-range trend of large instances of Aggregate Raw Off-Target (AggROT) across all Semi-Scheduled units",
    "date": "03-03-2024 08:20:00 PM",
    "content": "As part of the number crunching for GenInsights Quarterly Updates for 2023 Q4 (as we have in preceding issues, and before that in GenInsights21 ) we look at the incidence of large instances of Aggregate Raw Off-Target (i.e. AggROT) across two sets of units: 1) In Appendix 5 we perform this calculation across all operational* coal units . (a) For years we have chosen to focus on currently* operational coal units, to make it help make it easier to see if the performance of the fleet of coal units (by this metric) has changed in the ~15 years we can trend this data for the same set of units for i. Following the closure of Liddell a year ago, there are now 44 x operational coal units remaining. ii. Hence we run that same set of units back through till back in time to Q4 2001, which is when the relevant data started to be published (b) Because of some questions that arose through that analysis (particularly with respect to 2023 Q4 ) earlier today we posted a hypothesis and some questions in the form of an the article ‘A 20-year trend of large instances of Aggregate Raw Off-Target (AggROT) across 44 x coal units to 31st Dec 2023’ here. 2) In parallel, in Appendix 3 we perform this calculation across the growing number of Semi-Scheduled units : (a) both Wind and Large Solar units together (b) In this case across the growing number of units, i. as it’s the effect in aggregate that we’re most interested in (as it will be the one having the largest ii. and to explore the validity of a chorus of people who seem to be thinking that geographical diversity will fix any problems . Given we’d earlier shared in an article here on WattClarity about the 44 x coal units ( and because we’d promised to do so) we’re sharing this view of the broader trend for Semi-Scheduled units here today. This article also follows on from almost exactly twelve months ago, when we published ‘Some revelations in GenInsights Q4 2022 about Aggregate Raw Off-Target for Semi-Scheduled units’ . Recapping the stats for the coal units When we wrote about the coal units , we showed two trends: 1) The first was with respect to deviations greater than 200MW in either direction – noting that in 2023 there were: (a) 270 dispatch intervals through 2023 with collective under-performance greater than 200MW; and (b) 237 dispatch intervals through 2023 with collective over-performance greater than 200MW … where the incidence in both directions is sharply higher than in 2022. 2) Stepping up, to deviations greater than 300MW in either direction – in 2023 there were: (a) 31 dispatch intervals through 2023 with collective under-performance greater than 300MW … which was much the same as prior years (b) 28 dispatch intervals through 2023 with collective over-performance greater than 300MW i. In this case much larger incidence than prior years; and ii. For reasons not yet known, 18 of these incidences were in 2023 Q4 (something that will be investigated further, as time permits). So with this as a reference point, we’ll now look at VRE units, collectively … Long-range stats for Semi-Scheduled units Most VRE units are registered and operate as Semi-Scheduled units, which offers a different mode of operation compared to being fully Scheduled . We’ll skip the smaller deviations (i.e. 200MW) and just look at this trend for deviations greater than 300MW in either direction: Clearly the numbers are an order of magnitude (or more!) different . Particularly from 2022 to 2023 we see an interesting development: 1) Incidences of collective under- performance (i.e. AggROT > +300MW) have grown significantly : (a) From 1,018 Dispatch Intervals to 1,657 Dispatch Intervals (b) So averaging 4.5 instances per day in 2023 (c) Compared to 31 instances for the year with coal units. 2) Incidences of collective over- performance (i.e. AggROT < -300MW) have shrunk significantly : (a) From 293 Dispatch Intervals to 120 Dispatch Intervals (b) So averaging once every 3 days in 2023 (c) Compared to 28 instances for the year with coal units (after an increase from the year beforehand). Frequent readers will recall we’ve asked the question ‘is the Semi-Scheduled category sustainable, or scalable?’ as Key Observation 13/22 within GenInsights21 (and then shared this with readers here on 9th March 2023). 1) This ongoing (and accelerating) growth in incidence of large under- performance is one of the reasons for this question … 2) But we note the decline in incidence of over- performance and: (a) we infer that this has been as a result of the AEMC confirming tighter dispatch requirements for Semi-Scheduled units from 12th April 2021 . (b) we also take it that such an improved performance seems to have been technically possible … just a matter of ensuring the correctly aligned incentives Specific Case Studies of particular incidents Below I have tabulated (in reverse chronological order) some of the largest collective deviations across all Semi-Scheduled units that existed at each point in time. We hope these particular Case Studies will help to reveal the variety of reasons why there might be a large collective exceedance: Year (in reverse chronological order) Description of incidences of large AggROT across all Semi-Scheduled units during this year 2024 y.t.d. We’ve only past 2 months into calendar 2024 but already we have experienced the case of Tuesday 13th February 2024 as a day in which there was large collective instances of under-performance across all Semi-Scheduled units. When we compile GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2024 Q1 , it may preveal that there were other days, but for now we have already posted about ‘Aggregate Dispatch Error across all Semi-Scheduled units (NEM-wide) throughout Tuesday 13th February 2024’ . 2023 We’ve just completed the review of this particular metric for 2023 Q4 (completed report to follow soon). As part of that process we already published the start of two Case Studies 24 Dec 2023 … where we posted ‘Large instances of collective under-performance across all Semi-Scheduled units on Sunday 24th December 2023’ 31st Oct 2023 ‘… sees the only two instances (in Q4, and all year) of AggROT for Semi-Scheduled units < –500MW’ Earlier in the year (with the 2023 Q3 update) we flagged: 18th Aug 2023 … ‘Case Study (part 1) of large collective under-performance for Semi-Scheduled assets on Friday 18th August 2023’ .

    "title": "A 20-year trend of large instances of Aggregate Raw Off-Target (AggROT) across 44 x coal units to 31st Dec 2023",
    "date": "03-03-2024 01:22:00 PM",
    "content": "As part of the number crunching for GenInsights Quarterly Updates for 2023 Q4 (as we have in preceding issues, and before that in GenInsights21 ) we look at the incidence of large instances of Aggregate Raw Off-Target (i.e. AggROT) across all operational* coal units. * following the closure of Liddell a year ago, there are now 44 x operational coal units remaining. To make this analysis ‘apples-for-apples’ through time, we have calculated AggROT across those same 44 x units: (a) back in time to Q4 2001, which is when the relevant data started to be published (b) notwithstanding that there were 6 x supercritical units introduced in QLD in the first few years of that period. In crunching the numbers for the 2023 Q4 update, it became apparent that it would be useful sharing some of what we’ve been increasingly seeing, particularly as for 2023 Q4 it’s become more apparent . There’s a hypothesis below – but it’s really more of a question, so would be interested in considered thoughts from the more knowledgeable readers here at WattClarity ? … and for comparative reference, you might like to compare these results with those shown in ‘A long-range trend of large instances of Aggregate Raw Off-Target (AggROT) across all Semi-Scheduled units’ , also published today. Long range trend of AggROT for coal units Here’s two charts that trend a count (per year) of how many dispatch intervals exceed certain levels of AggROT for these 44 x coal units. Remember to click on any image in WattClarity articles to open as larger resolution in a separate tab for easier reading … Also remember that there are 105,120 dispatch intervals in a (non-leap) year, so we are talking some pretty small percentages of time. In the first chart we count the incidence greater than 200MW – remembering that: 1) Negative AggROT corresponds to over- performance relative to collective Target and Regulation Enablement levels; whilst 2) Positive AggROT corresponds to under- performance relative to collective Target and Regulation Enablement levels; whilst Counts for greater exceedances are also included, but we can skip those for now, as they are also shown below at larger scale. Focusing just on the 200MW below, and 200MW above, we see that: 1) From 2002 to 2019 the numbers are largely similar … leading to a sense that (in terms of this particular metric) coal units were (at least until 2020) collectively not performing ‘worse’ within a dispatch interval than they have historically 2) From 2020 we see the incidence begin to grow : (a) Firstly for AggROT > +200MW and then for AggROT <-200MW. … not sure why one lagged the other, at this point. (b) With growth in the 2023 year particularly rapid . 3) Here’s one hypothesis : (a) We’ve annotated this chart in 2020 to remind that: i. Implementation of Primary Frequency Response (PFR) for ‘Tranche 1’ units began from late September 2020 ; and ii. Tranche 1 included many coal units, and correlates with growth in the incidence of AggROT for coal units. (b) This development coincides with when incidence larger than 200MW (in both directions) began to grow; (c) So it seems a logical question to ask about the extent the one caused the other ? 4) Interested in considered thoughts from readers about: (a) The possibility that this might be true (or not); and (b) How we might verify that? Deleting both 200MW trends from the chart above we’re left looking at incidences greater than 300MW, and see a few other interesting developments: In this case we see that: 1) Excepting some interesting developments for the full year 2023 (which were not present even when we crunched the numbers for 2023 Q3 !) there’s not been a growth in incidence at this larger level. 2) However what’s appeared out of the blue in 2023 Q4 is that the incidence of AggROT <-300MW : (a) Albeit that the total (i.e. only 28 dispatch intervals ) is still a small number; (b) It’s much greater than any earlier year and really stands out . (c) Which begs the question … whether this is the start of a new trend? A focus just on calendar 2023 I mentioned above that this only became apparent when crunching the numbers for 2023 Q4 (i.e. not even for 2023 Q3 ), and that is because 18 of the 28 instances appeared in Q4. Plotting just those 28 x Dispatch Intervals on a timeline through 2023, we see the following: There’s a cluster in 2023 Q1 , and there’s a larger cluster in 2023 Q4 , but not much in between. Of the cluster in 2023 Q4 , we see: 1) There are two dispatch intervals on 16th October 2023 with AggROT <-300MW, as follows: (a) 09:05 = –332MW (b) 13:05 = -341MW 2) There are three dispatch intervals on 29th November 2023 with AggROT <-300MW, as follows: (a) 10:50 = –301MW (b) 13:25 = –331MW (c) 13:45 = –317MW 3) But there are also 8 instances over a 5-day period being 22nd December 2023 to 27th December 2023. 4) Plus 5 discrete instances on other days through Q4. We wonder, what’s going on? Not shown here, but all 28 x instances through calendar 2023 occurred through daylight hours , and mostly at times of the day when we’d expect strong sunlight. We wonder if that suggests some part of the cause, or whether it’s just correlation? Zooming in to just the end of 2023 So here’s a chart of all the calculated AggROT metric for all dispatch intervals between 22nd December 2023 to 31st December 2023 (i.e. the last 10 days of the year): The 8 x DIs during this 5-day period seeing AggROT < –300MW are all individually identified … plus one on 31st Dec 2023 that was AggROT > +300MW . We might come back later at some point (time permitting) to drill into some specific examples via Case Studies to understand more about what went on, and hopefully why . … but that’s all I have time for now.",

    "content": "Today I’ve already posted two ( seemingly unrelated ) articles: 1) Peering back into 2023 Q4 I first posted ‘A quick summary of aggregate yield from Large Solar on Tuesday 28th November 2023’ as part of the number crunching for GenInsights Quarterly Updates for 2023 Q4 . 2) Then I posted ‘Consultation opens (and webinar next Friday) on Design Paper for ‘Capacity Investment Scheme’’ … with the design paper having been published on Thursday 29th February 2024 (what a coincidence!). In this third article I’ve tied both together. Large Solar production, NEMwide on Thu 29th Feb 2024 Using the NEMreview analysis template in the first article, it was a simple matter of changing the date range to provide a view of aggregate solar production across the NEM on Thu 29th Feb 2024: Those with a licence to the software can open their own copy of this query here . This is a very different picture to that shown for 28th Nov 2023 , with aggregate production from Large Solar across the NEM peaking above 6,000MW from around 11:45 ( NEM time ) on the day … representing an instantaneous capacity factor above 75% … an impressive figure. However we also note that, at the time the NSW spikes start on the day, we have a faster than ‘should have been’ decline in aggregate production through the afternoon period (i.e. from ~14:00 NEM time ). We see this in the yellowed fill shape (i.e. Energy-Constrained Availability) peeking out behind the multi-colours through the afternoon period. Large Solar production, NSW only on Thu 29th Feb 2024 With the NSW region being the particular focus for this day, I’ve re-jigged the chart to show Large Solar just in NSW as follows: Those with a licence to the software can open their own copy of this query here . Obviously there is lower installed capacity in NSW than there is right across the NEM, so the numbers are lower … but it’s much clearer to see the curtailment through the afternoon, as it is much larger in relative terms . We hypothesise that this is all due to network congestion: 1) Because prices were very healthy, so you would have been crazy to bid out of the market during the afternoon; and 2) Because we saw ( here, with reference to 15:10 ) plenty of constraint equations bound in NSW for that particular dispatch interval … and presumably through the afternoon.",

    "title": "Consultation opens (and webinar next Friday) on Design Paper for ‘Capacity Investment Scheme’",
    "date": "02-03-2024 01:00:00 PM",
    "content": "On 14th May 2023 we wrote about how ‘We’re not building enough replacement dispatchable (i.e. firming) capacity’ following the inclusion of some new data in GenInsights Quarterly Update for Q1 2023 . But our concerns go back way further … For instance (back in 2017 when we began compiling the GRC2018 ) we had clearly seen that there was an emerging Schism between: Service #1) the rise of ‘ anytime/anywhere energy ’ and Service #2) the need to provide separate mechanisms to encourage the development, maintenance and operations of a range of different technology providing ‘keeping the lights on services’ . So it was with keen interest that we saw the development of the Capacity Investment Scheme as (what we thought was) an attempt to provide for that 2nd type of service (i.e. firming capacity). 1) When we saw (back on 9th December 2022) the announcement that the ‘Capacity Investment Scheme to power Australian energy market transition’ . 2) When we saw that the ‘Discussion Paper released on Capacity Investment Scheme’ in Aug 2023 . … In that article we noted the ambition that ‘… The CIS expects to bring on at least $10 billion of new investment and 6 GW of clean dispatchable capacity by 2030. ’ 3) And then when we were (perhaps suckered) with the headline that the ‘Federal Government announces expansion of the Capacity Investment Scheme on 23rd November 2023’ . … although on this front we were a little concerned that it seemed a bit like ‘bait and switch’ given that the large share of the increase in capacity touted (i.e. to a headline of 32GW installed capacity ) was: (a) for new incentivisation for the development of more ‘ anytime/anywhere energy ’ capacity (i.e. 23GW of the 32GW headline number) i. which already had support mechanisms including the RET (albeit now in its twilight years), and state-based renewable targets, and corporate purchasing processes (expanding the market for LGCs); ii. some of which were already noted as Villain no 7 back in 2020 when we wrote ‘we’ve been killing new entrants with kindness?’ . (b) leaving the procurement incentives for providing ‘keeping the lights on services’ down to a much more meagre 9GW capacity … which our analysis in May 2023 had already shown was nowhere near enough ! Perhaps the devil was always in the fine print (in which case it’s my fault for not finding it) but I’m more cautious as a result of feeling burnt by the headlines – for instance in reading the news this week that consultations open on the Design Paper for the expanded Capacity Investment Scheme : This page on the ‘Department of Energy’ Canberra website notes three important things : Important Note #1) 35-page PDF Design Paper For a start, on Thursday 29th February 2024 the Department released this 35-page Design Paper on the Capacity Investment Scheme : An appropriate (and ironic) day for release of a design paper on a Capacity Investment Scheme, given it was the day this week: 1) that NSW probably experienced all-time peak in ‘Underlying Demand’ , and 2) Would have really struggled to maintain supply without the contributions (or energy, and other services) by Eraring power station … a plant that is slated to close in August 2025 (now under 18 months away).

    "title": "So where does NSW peak demand on Thu 29th Feb 2024 sit in historical context?",
    "date": "01-03-2024 09:48:00 AM",
    "content": "A logical question, in relation to the high points for peak demand in NSW on Thu 29th Feb 2024 is where that sits in a historical context (with a particular form of that question being whether it was an all-time maximum or not). This morning I’ve quickly pulled this updated trend of monthly maximum demand points (using NEMreview v7 ) for the 3 different data sets the AEMO directly publishes and will leave this here for a start: With respect to the dates of high points noted in the chart above, I’m expanding on these in the table below: Day and Date (reverse chronological) High point on the day, measured as ‘Market Demand’ High point on the day, measured as ‘Operational Demand’ High point on the day, derived* as ‘Underlying Demand’ … noting this is a derived figure, not published directly by AEMO. Thu 29th Feb 2024 We noted at the time that ‘NSW Market demand peaks at 13,764MW ‘ . This occurred in the 16:35 dispatch interval . As we can see in the chart above, this is the highest point seen since 31st Jan 2019 (i.e. 5 years and 1 month earlier) Using the AEMO’s published ‘Operational Demand’ date series (published on a 30 minute cadence) the high point for this day was 13,643MW in the half hour ending 17:00. This was not an all-time record. We noted at the time that ‘NSW Underlying Demand peaks at 15,100MW at 15:00 (NEM time) on Thu 29th Feb 2024′ . Sat 1st Feb 2020 On the day after, we posted ‘Out of the blue, another LOR2’ with respect to a stressful day in NSW. Highest point on the day was 13,717MW at 16:55 NEM time. Using the AEMO’s published ‘Operational Demand’ date series (published on a 30 minute cadence) the high point for this day was 13,835MW . Using the identical logic* to calculate ‘Underlying Demand’ as used for Thu 29th Feb 2024, I’ve wound the clock back at posted ‘Derivation of Underlying Demand in NSW on 30th and 31st January and 1st February 2020’ here. * re ‘identical logic’, note that there were no BESS existing in NSW at the time. From that chart we see that: 1 On Sat 1st Feb 2020 the highest point for Underlying Demand was 14,451MW at 15:00 ; 2 But there was actually a higher point on Fri 31st Jan 2020 ( 14,481MW at 15:30 ) with a spike in some of the underlying data. This has not been investigated. Either way, these points were below that derived for Thu 29th Feb 2024 . Thu 31st Jan 2019 There was no article published at the time about this day. Highest point on the day was 13,778MW at 16:30 NEM time. Using the AEMO’s published ‘Operational Demand’ date series (published on a 30 minute cadence) the high point for this day was 13,821MW . Using the identical logic* to calculate ‘Underlying Demand’ as used for Thu 29th Feb 2024, I’ve wound the clock back at posted ‘Derivation of Underlying De mand in NSW on 29th, 30th and 31st January 2019′ here. * re ‘identical logic’, note that there were no BESS existing in NSW at the time. From that chart we see that the highest point was at 14,421MW for the half hour ending 16:00 (NEM time) on Thursday 31st Jan 2019. This point was below that derived for Thu 29th Feb 2024 . Fri 10th Feb 2017 On the day we posted ‘Demand in NSW soars but falls short of setting a new record’ . Highest point on the day was 14,108MW at 17:30 NEM time. Using the AEMO’s published ‘Operational Demand’ date series (published on a 30 minute cadence) the high point for this day was 14,087MW . This is the highest point shown in the data since the data began to be published. But note that it’s lower than the ‘Market Demand’ level seen on 1st February 2011. Using the identical logic* to calculate ‘Underlying Demand’ as used for Thu 29th Feb 2024, I’ve wound the clock back at posted ‘Derivation of Underlying De mand in NSW on 8th, 9th and 10th February 2017′ here. * re ‘identical logic’, note that: (a) there were no BESS existing in NSW at the time. (b) this was also before the AEMO was estimating rooftop PV, so the logic has been modified to use the APVI estimates … but beware of ‘ the opacity of rooftop PV ‘. From that chart we see that the highest point was at 14,447 MW for the half hour ending 15:00 ( NEM time ) on Friday 10th February 2017. This point was below that derived for Thu 29th Feb 2024. Fri 18th Jan 2013 On the day we posted ‘Scorching Sydney drives demand today into the red zone’ . Highest point on the day (and for summer 2012-13) was 13,857MW at 15:15 NEM time. The AEMO only began publishing this data series in December 2014. So we can’t compare way back here on a perfect ‘apples-to-apples’ comparison. Using the identical logic* to calculate ‘Underlying Demand’ as used for Thu 29th Feb 2024, I’ve wound the clock back at posted ‘Derivation of Underlying De mand in NSW on 16th, 17th and 18th January 2013′ here. * re ‘identical logic’, note that: (a) there were no BESS existing in NSW at the time. (b) there was also nothing counted in the way of solar production, and very small wind production. From that chart we see that the highest point was at 13,949 MW for the half hour ending 15:30 ( NEM time ) on Friday 18th January 2013. This point was below that derived for Thu 29th Feb 2024. Tue 1st Feb 2011 On this day we wrote ‘NEM-wide demand higher still, as NSW regional demand eclipses record’ . The peak level seen was 14,649MW at 16:05 . The AEMO only began publishing this data series in December 2014. So we can’t compare way back here on a perfect ‘apples-to-apples’ comparison. Using the identical logic* to calculate ‘Underlying Demand’ as used for Thu 29th Feb 2024, I’ve wound the clock back at posted ‘Derivation of Underlying De mand in NSW on 30th and 31st Jan and 1st Feb 2011′ here. * re ‘identical logic’, note that: (a) there were no BESS existing in NSW at the time.

    "title": "So how much did Eraring Power Station supply, of the NSW electricity consumption, at peak demand time on Thursday 29th February 2024?",
    "date": "29-02-2024 10:18:00 PM",
    "content": "Today ( Thu 29th Feb 2024 ) promised to be one with tight supply-demand balance … and it did deliver some excitement, including: 1) a high point for demand in NSW, whether you measure it by ‘Market Demand’ , or try to estimate ‘Underlying Demand’ ). 2) and plenty of volatility in NSW and QLD. etc… Coincident with anticipations of what might happen, on Wednesday evening Angela Macdonald-Smith and Samantha Hutchinson wrote about ‘ Power market in the dark as negotiations over Eraring drag on’ in the AFR: In that article and with respect to forecasts for today, they write (with respect to the Eraring Power Station, which is slated to close in 2025 ): ‘A squeeze on the NSW power grid forecast for Thursday amid a blast of late summer heat has underscored the vital role the generator , on the Central Coast, still plays. Thursday’s heat represents one of the first serious tests to the state’s energy infrastructure during what is regarded as a milder-than-usual summer.’ Noting this (but also remembering that I’d flagged some possible concerns with 3 of 4 Eraring units in relation to today ) I took the chart prepared in our NEMreview v7 software for the preceding article, and added in Eraring Power Station to see … Eraring supply of Underlying Demand was a low of 16.5% at time of peak demand Into this chart I added three new data series : 1) Aggregate output of the 4 x Eraring units, which extends through to the ‘now’ point of the chart because I chose to use FinalMW and not Target; 2) Available Generation for the 4 x Eraring units, which stops at 04:00 because that’s the end of the ‘next day public’ data set; and 3) The percentage ratio of Eraring output to Underlying Demand … again on a half-hourly basis keeping in line with the methodology for how I calculated Underlying Demand. Here’s the updated chart: Likewise, those with a licence to the NEMreview software can open their own copy of this separate query here . From this chart we can see a few things: 1) Output from Eraring is fairly consistent across the three days … dropping somewhat below Available Generation for the 4 x units at times when ‘Grid Demand’ is lower (i.e. at night, or in the middle of the day). 2) We can see the contribution from Eraring to meeting (much more variable!) Underlying Demand in the region ranges from high points somewhat above 30% (e.g. at times of low demand) down to a low point: (a) That is always above 15% ; and (b) Which was 16.5% at the 15:00 half hour period which we calculated was peak in Underlying Demand . 3) We can’t see data for Available Generation beyond 04:00 this morning at present, but we can see the output of Eraring was a little more variable throughout all daylight hours today . We won’t really know why that was the case until we can see the ‘next day public’ data – but I could speculate that it might be a combination of any of these… (a) Capability of the unit (i.e. Available Generation) affected by higher ambient temperatures ? i. remembering that almost all types of technology are affected by high ambient temperatures … ii. hydro being one exception where the data does not support short term limitations – albeit the longer term implications in terms of drought conditions. (b) It might have been the capability of the unit was affected in some other way (i.e. not related to temperature)? (c) It might be that there were constraints (external to the unit) that affected output in some way? (d) Or it might have been commercial behaviour? (e) Something else? I’ve leave the chart there, but also worth noting that … … the above does not consider other essential services Readers should keep in mind that this quick analysis only covers ‘Energy’ – it does not cover the grab-bag of other services we loosely labelled ‘keeping the lights on services’ when we spoke about the emerging schism way back when we wrote the GRC2018 a number of years ago now. Some of these include: 1) The (now 10) different FCAS commodities . … On this note I took the opportunity to open up the recently released GSD2023 to look at two of the FCAS-specific pages for two Eraring units (ER02 and ER03 on interposing pages) and see that they have been a consistent participant in 8 x FCAS markets over the past 10 years: 2) Firmness and long-term energy storage : … although challenged during winter 2022, which was just another reminder of how we wrote about the escalating risks of ‘the rise of ‘Just in Time’’ in Key Observation 5/22 within GenInsights 21 , just over 2 years ago now. 3) Inertia ; 4) System strength ; … remember that it was only on 20th February 2024 (i.e. 9 days ago) when we received the AEMO notice about ‘System Strength Requirements in NSW’ … which could see times of significant challenge with a closure of Eraring ( without replacement by syncons or something of the sort). etc… Not sure I have seen (in analysis with respect to) ‘can Eraring close as currently earmarked’ these sorts of ‘keeping the lights on services’ considered. Have I missed something? Seems a very tall order (perhaps some think a tall tale?) to expect all of this to be replaced sufficiently for Eraring to close as currently scheduled on Mon 18th Aug 2025 (i.e. just under 18 months time). What would Darryl Kerrigan say? Perhaps … ‘Tell them they’re dreaming?’",

So the resulting chart here is of 30 minute cadence (i.e. the best ‘common’ resolution): Those with a licence to the NEMreview software can open their own copy of this query here . We can clearly see that Thursday 29th February 2024 was a much bigger day in NSW than the 2 prior days, in terms of electricity consumption. Adding up all the supply side contributions I’ve noted an estimate for ‘ Underlying Demand ’ and note that, using this estimate, the peak point was at 15,100MW in the half hour ending 15:00 … which is incidentally just prior to this first price spike at 15:10. But wait, what’s all this about the different measures of demand? Just in two sequential articles here on this site, I have seen that: 1) ‘Underlying Demand’ peaked at 15,100MW in the half hour ending 15:00; and yet also 2) You also just read on WattClarity that ‘NSW ‘Market Demand’ peaks at 13,764MW’ (in the 16:35 dispatch interval). 3) Furthermore, elsewhere there are other measurements and high points as well – including at least: (a) Adding numbers up by a different method, Global Power Energy on LinkedIn here says that ‘Native Demand’ peaked at 15,606.7 MW at 15:10 : Well done to the team at GPE for explaining their method, as foll0ws: ‘Native Demand (or Underlying Demand) represents the Total Demand plus Non-Scheduled Generation and the output from behind-the-meter Rooftop PV . The Rooftop PV figure is an interpolated 5-minute value, derived from estimated 30-minute Rooftop PV data. Currently, we utilise a basic interpolation method to ascertain 5-minute values for Rooftop PV. While we acknowledge this method is not ideal, it is necessary due to the limitations in the data provided by AEMO. This approach, albeit a compromise, enables us to construct a more comprehensive picture of electricity demand. It incorporates the significant, yet often underrepresented, impact of distributed energy resources like rooftop PV.’ … so it’s a different method than mine in a couple ways. (b) Also today, David Osmond uses OpenNEM here on Twitter to say that the demand peak (he does not give a specific name for the measure) peaked at 15,400MW at 15:00 . I’ve not specifically looked at the OpenNEM method. (c) It may well be later that the AEMO comes along and talks about ‘Operational Demand’ . (d) And there may well be others… So it’s no wonder you might be confused! A panadol, or an explanation? You might let these measurements do your head in … or you could take a panadol and lie down … or you might choose to read through ‘An explainer about electricity demand [take 1]’ from April 2018 that provides the start of an explanation! The key takeaway was that demand was big today in NSW , however you measure it!",

Whilst remembering that the bid price curve would already be at the steeper gradients for the 15:05 dispatch interval (so it would not take all that much to tip it over the edge), we might have a first look this afternoon (i.e. in the absence of the larger ‘next day public’ data sets) to see what we can see about what might have contributed. A few different factors not forecast (as extreme) in advance So we’ll start with a few views of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in windows of ez2view , Time-Travelled back to the 15:10 dispatch interval. Remember that you can use this widget to ‘ look up a vertical ’ to see ‘that other dimension of time’ – that’s something we’re going to do now with a few different variables. Regional Demand ( higher than earlier forecasts) Here’s two different copies of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget together: In the left panel here we show the NSW spot price, and we see the price at 15:10: 1) was higher than the P5 predispatch price for 15;10 produced at around 15:00:40 (with the 15:00 dispatch interval); but also 2) was not higher than the P5 predispatch price for 15;10 produced at around 14:55:40 (with the 15:00 dispatch interval); but also So, in essence, certainly not ‘out of the blue’ . On the right panel we show NSW ‘ Market Demand ’ and see that (in both dimensions) the demand was climbing through to 15:10: 1) up the diagonal (i.e. following the natural progression of time) we see the demand grow from 12,xxxMW at the 14:30 dispatch interval to be 13,239MW at the 15:10 dispatch interval ; but also (perhaps more importantly) 2) up the vertical (i.e. seeing successive forecasts for the same future time point) we see the forecast for 15:10 grow from 12,806MW forecast (for 15:10) published at the 14:30 time point to be 433MW higher by 15:10: (a) i.e. 3.3% higher than the forecast for the same time point only 40 minutes earlier (b) that’s an impressive increase in a short space of time Available Generation ( lower than earlier forecasts) Leaving the widget on the left focused on price, we flip the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget to look at regional aggregate for Available Generation in NSW: Comparing the same two time points we see that: 1) up the diagonal (i.e. following the natural progression of time) we see the AvailGen rise from the low point at 14:30 (i.e. 14,870MW) but then drop to the exact same low point (i.e. 14,870MW) for the 15:10 dispatch interval; 2) up the vertical (i.e. seeing successive forecasts for the same future time point) we see the forecast for 15:10 grow drop by 430MW over a 40 minute period: (a) from a forecast of 15,300MW (at 15;10) published for the 14:30 dispatch interval; (b) down to the ‘actual’ 14,870MW at 15:10 (c) so a 2.8% drop than the forecast for the same time point only 40 minutes earlier Adding both changes together, that’s an impressively large 863MW! UIGF for Wind Farms across NSW ( lower than earlier forecasts) Taking it a step further and looking at wind capability, we flip the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget to look at regional aggregate for UIGF Wind in NSW: Comparing the same two time points we see that: 1) up the diagonal (i.e. following the natural progression of time) we see the Wind UIGF rise from 451MW at 14:30 but then drop to the 404MW at the 15:10 dispatch interval; 2) up the vertical (i.e. seeing successive forecasts for the same future time point) we see the forecast for 15:10 grow drop by 60MW over a 40 minute period. So a 14% component of the 430MW total drop in Available Generation. UIGF for Solar Farms across NSW (sharply lower than earlier forecasts) Now we flip the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget to look at regional aggregate for UIGF Solar in NSW: Remembering at this time that solar’s already begun its ramp down to sunset at the end of the day, comparing the same two time points we see that: 1) up the diagonal (i.e. following the natural progression of time) we see the Solar UIGF rise from 1,970MW at 14:30 but then drop sharply from 15:05 to be 1,801MW at the 15:10 dispatch interval; 2) up the vertical (i.e. seeing successive forecasts for the same future time point) we see the forecast for 15:10 grow drop by 177MW (from 1,978MW forecast to 1,801MW actual) over a 40 minute period. So a 41% component of the 430MW total drop in Available Generation. Other contributions to the drop in Available Generation We’d need to wait until the ‘next day public’ data tomorrow to see in more detail – because it’s only 237MW (i.e. 55%) of the ‘lower than forecast’ is due to lower than expected VRE (based on the measurement points above). Something else has also happened with other (fully Scheduled ) units … A view of the NSW region at the 15:10 dispatch interval In this second window, we’re looking at a collage of widgets, with the most important being the ‘NSW Schematic’ widget in a pre-release copy of ez2view version 9.9 (which we’re gearing up for the IESS mid-year changes, so looks a bit different than the one you’re using yourself): There’s lots to see here, and we don’t have time to delve into much at all, but a few key things to note: 1) Whilst the QNI interconnector is going gangbusters at transferring 1,000MW south (i.e. dispatch target at the import limit in this interval), at the southern end we see the VIC1-NSW1 interconnector stuck at 0MW , with the import and export limits both set at that level. That’s clearly a factor. 2) In the ‘Bound Constraints’ widget we see an impressive list of 7 different bound constraints in the NSW ‘coverage’ area: (a) Some of these will have affected the interconnectors (the Marginal Value might be a hint as to which ones); but also (b) These are also bouncing around the outputs of units within NSW 3) In particular: (a) we see Avonlie Solar Farm having significantly reduced its output: i. There are four of those seven bound constraint equations impacting on the AVLSF1 unit; ii. Quickly reviewing the ‘Constraint Dashboard’ widget for each one (not shown here), with AVLSF1 unit in the top half, in terms of LHS factors, for all of these: 1. The ‘N>>NIL_39_11’ constraint equation . 2. The ‘N>>NIL_4’ constraint equation . 3. The ‘N>>NIL_7_1_LSC1_ON’ constraint equation . 4. The ‘N>>NIL_970_051’ constraint equation. (b) we also see Metz Solar Farm having significantly reduced its output in this dispatch interval: i. In this case, only 2 bound constraint equations. ii. In this case it’s clear that it’s the ‘N>>NIL_964_84_S’ constraint equation is driving the curtailment. (c) Whereas, on the upside, Limondale 1 has increased output by 73MW. i. In this case, there are 4 bound constraints ii. But for this dispatch interval, the units CPD Price has risen off –$1,000.01/MWh to be $998.28/MWh which allows dispatch (and demonstrates the unit is most likely bidding –$1,000/MWh as it was the day before) (d) No time to look through the whole list, but it is many units impacted by constraints… Hopefully this is the start of helping readers understand that the singular price spike at 15:10 was a complex outcome of actuals being different than forecasts, complex network topology in the heat (hence constraint operation) and other things as well (e.g. no doubt a bit of rebidding). — In contrast, Dan’s already noted that prices began spiking at 16:25 , and it’s likely (though we have not looked) that this is more a direct function of supply-demand tightness as solar declines more rapidly with Underlying Demand still up.",

    "title": "A quick look back at the coincident short outages at Tarong 1 and Tarong 2 yesterday",
    "date": "29-02-2024 12:28:00 PM",
    "content": "Yesterday I’d written two articles about TARONG#1 and TARONG#2 in quick succession: Around 10:00, I wrote about ‘Two units at Tarong come offline Wednesday morning 28th Feb 2024 … not planned in advance’ . Early afternoon I had then written ‘Both Tarong units back online ~3 hours later’ . Following from this, there was a bit of speculation internally about what the possible cause might have been for the coincident outages (especially given that the ‘coming off’ profile and ‘coming back on’ profile were so very similar between units, just spaced slightly apart in time). What happened on Wednesday 28th February 2024 at TARONG#1 and TARONG#2 With the advantage of ‘next day public’ data we can look at more now, via the ez2view software as follows… TARONG#1 (offline 09:15 Wednesday 28th February 2024) Firstly here’s a view of the past two days at the TARONG#1 unit, which was the one offline first yesterday, and also back online first as well. Using the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget we can show Bid Stack and Bid Table, which shows ‘final bids’ (i.e. a concatenation of the real bids NEMDE assessed across all dispatch intervals, taking into account all rebids) ‘Capped and Dispatch Availability’: In the table underneath we see the bids and rebids taken into account in that 2-day period (remember bids not visible from 04:05 this morning yet). I’ve selected* two in particular and used the ‘Bid Comparison’ function on the second tab, which we show here: * for those with licensed access to the software, remember this is a ‘Control Click’ function. As noted there, it seems that: 1) Tuesday morning 27th February 2024 they conducted a ‘Stem Free Test’ on the unit 2) Perhaps as a result of that, it was determined shortly afterwards (i.e. by 11:23 when new ‘Daily Bid’ submitted for the following day) that a short outage was required for Wednesday morning 28th February 2024. Part of this outage would entail a rapid ramp down, and a rapid ramp up. TARONG#2 (offline 09:40 Wednesday 28th February 2024) For illustration purposes, a very similar decision process seems to have been followed for Unit 2: So to sum up, the outages did appear to have been planned … just at very short notice – so not appearing days in advance in the ‘Generator Outages’ widget (or noted in the first article ): perhaps in response to something observed in the two ‘Stem Free Tests’ conducted). My real engineering experience is too rusty to speculate more on what those reasons might be? Perhaps some more learned readers still working as engineers within thermal power stations might suggest more in comments below? No change in outage plans Perhaps more importantly, a quick glance at the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view shows no change in outage plans within the next 2 weeks for the Tarong units – so we might assume whatever the purpose of the short outages, it might have been effective? But that’s all for now…",

    "content": "Early afternoon yesterday I posted ‘The forecast LOR2 for NSW on Thursday 29th February 2024 grows more extreme …’ … and this has subsequently been doing some rounds on social media. Well, the good news is that the more recent AEMO forecasts, whilst still seeing forecast LOR2 tight supply-demand balance for tomorrow afternoon/evening in NSW, it’s not as extreme. This juxtaposition of 4 different ‘ Forecast Convergence ’ widgets in one window at 14:05 on Wednesday 28th February 2024 highlights a few factors: In particular, we see: 1) The most recent forecast runs for forecast ‘ Market Demand ’ see this improving (i.e. getting lower), though still above 13,000MW – so still high, in the context of summer 2023-24 . 2) The most recent forecast runs for forecast Available Generation also see an improvement here (i.e. growing larger). 3) In terms of the ‘Surplus’ calculated between the two, in the ST PASA runs there was a step change improvement seen between the 07:00 run and the 08:00 runs this morning (which have not been investigated). The most recent AEMO Market Notice (MN xxx published at 13:34:34 NEM time today) reflects this: ‘——————————————————————- MARKET NOTICE ——————————————————————- From : AEMO To : NEMITWEB1 Creation Date : 28/02/2024 13:34:34 ——————————————————————- Notice ID : 115287 Notice Type ID : RESERVE NOTICE Notice Type Description : LRC/LOR1/LOR2/LOR3 Issue Date : 28/02/2024 External Reference : PDPASA – Forecast Lack Of Reserve Level 2 (LOR2) in the NSW Region on 29/02/2024 ——————————————————————- Reason : AEMO ELECTRICITY MARKET NOTICE AEMO declares a Forecast LOR2 condition under clause 4.8.4(b) of the National Electricity Rules for the NSW region for the following period: [1.] From 1600 hrs 29/02/2024 to 1900 hrs 29/02/2024 .

    "title": "Stubborn forecasts for LOR2 (low reserve condition) for NSW for Thursday evening 29th February 2024",
    "date": "27-02-2024 11:31:00 AM",
    "content": "There’s been some chatter on our internal Slack channel overnight with respect to forecasts for this Thursday (29th February 2024) in NSW, so I thought it might be time to update this article posted on Sunday early afternoon . Updated forecasts for LOR2 for NSW Here’s an updated view of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget (two views of it) from ez2view at the 09:55 dispatch interval Tuesday morning 27th February (i.e. ~56 hours out from the time in focus): ‘Looking up a vertical’ , we can clearly see the stubborn forecasts for LOR2 -level low reserve condition for NSW for Thursday evening. Linton’s the analyst who’s been looking in more statistically at forecasts for LOR as part of Appendix 1 in the GenInsights Quarterly Updates series. Based on that analysis, Linton’s made a comment that ‘According to our GenInsights, when an LOR is forecast 3 days ahead, the chance of it occurring is around 20-30%’ . Linton’s helpfully lifted this chart out of a bigger artefact included in the (under development) GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q4 … so including data now for the full 2023 calendar year, which is the focus for ‘hits’ and ‘misses’ here: Before any readers falls down that rabbit hole of the ‘accuracy of forecasts’ , remember that the AEMO’s predispatch and ST PASA processes are designed to elicit a market response … so the fact that ‘only’ 20-30% of forecast Low Reserve Condition actually persist to the point of dispatch should be viewed as a good thing (and ideally should be lower than that!) High Forecast Demand On the left panel, we see forecasts that ‘Market Demand’ could be significantly over 13,500MW … which would be exceptional for summer 2023-24. Possible Issues at Eraring? On the other side of the supply-demand balance equation, it’s worth flagging that it appears that Eraring might have a few units struggling at present – at seen in this snapshot from ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view: I’ve highlighted the 4 x Eraring units – and have also highlighted Thursday 29th February (the day of particular concern). This data has been published as a result of a concerted effort by several at ERM (now Shell) to provide better visibility of supply-side outage plans. It’s much better than what was there beforehand (which was nothing), and it was further enhanced with changes that went live on 9th October 2023, but it’s still not ‘perfect’ visibility. 1) Case in point in this article is that that the data for Thursday 29th February is now ‘stale’ , having been last published for 18:00 last Saturday 24th February 2024. 2) Other issues include the ongoing invisibility of Semi-Scheduled units , and also the invisibility of Loads Working with what we have, and focusing on each unit in turn: Eraring unit 1 This unit has slated an ‘Unplanned Maintenance Outage’ (coloured red in ez2view) to start on Tuesday 5th March. Without knowing the specific reasons for this unplanned maintenance (e.g. I’ve not checked recent rebid reasons to see if that might indicate anything), there’s natural questions about how firm that start date might be – or if circumstances might arise where it needs to be brought forward (of especial concern if that impacted on Thursday 29th February). Eraring unit 2 This unit is the one showing green all the way … albeit that there’s some slight reductions in capacity offered on some days ( perhaps due to high temperature de-rating, which affects almost all types of technology in the electricity sector). Eraring unit 3 This unit also has an ‘Unplanned Maintenance Outage’ … but it’s important to note that: 1) This unit appears with this Unit State on Sunday 3rd and Monday 4th March – based on data submitted by Origin Energy for 09:00 this morning (Tue 27th Feb 2024). 2) But it’s not clear when it actually is slated to begin , because the data up until Saturday 2nd March is ‘stale’, as noted above. So there is more concern that whatever the issues might be with this unit might impact on this Thursday? Eraring unit 4 This unit has no outage planned, but has been running with a significant de-rating (i.e. 360MW maximum availability) for many days. Again, I have not investigated further to understand reasons at this point. Trajectory of forecast Available Generation Flipping back to the the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget at the 10:55 dispatch interval I’ve flipped the view to show: 1) Available Generation in NSW on the left; and 2) Surplus Generation in NSW on the right (noting this is only published in ST PASA, not P30 Predispatch). Here it is: Keep in mind that NSW is, on average, a net importer of energy (i.e. heavily relies on imports from QLD and VIC) … which makes it no surprise that it’s going to have a deficit of local generation on a high demand time like Thursday evening. … but forecasts for a deficit of –4,714MW still clearly stand out, in terms of the week! ‘Looking up a vertical’ , on the left panel in the area marked, at least there’s no stark colour changes in terms of forecast Available Generation in aggregate for NSW … it’s not really getting better (i.e. bluer = larger), but it’s not growing worse, either. Trajectory of forecast UIGF for Solar, and for Wind Using the same window, I’ve now flipped the the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget at the 10:55 dispatch interval to show: 1) Forecast UIGF for Solar in NSW on the left; and 2) Forecast UIGF for Wind in NSW on the right. Here it is: Unfortunately in both pictures there appear to be unwelcome news: 1) On the left, we see the top few rows in the grid (i.e. most recent forecasts) suggesting late afternoon cloud cover suppressing yield from Large Solar farms … and presumably rooftop solar as well. 2) On the right, we see that the blue (i.e. low wind yield) cells have shifted more to the left (i.e. into the times of peak demand in NSW on Thursday afternoon-evening). This helps to explain these updates from the AEMO … Market Notices from AEMO At 10:17:34 this morning, the AEMO published MN115201 to give an update on the forecast LOR2 for NSW for this Thursday: ‘——————————————————————- MARKET NOTICE ——————————————————————- From : AEMO To : NEMITWEB1 Creation Date : 27/02/2024 10:17:34 ——————————————————————- Notice ID : 115201 Notice Type ID : RESERVE NOTICE Notice Type Description : LRC/LOR1/LOR2/LOR3 Issue Date : 27/02/2024 External Reference : STPASA – Update of the Forecast Lack Of Reserve Level 2 (LOR2) in the NSW Region on 29/02/2024 ——————————————————————- Reason : AEMO ELECTRICITY MARKET NOTICE The Forecast LOR2 condition in the NSW region advised in AEMO Electricity Market Notice No. 115197 has been updated at 0900 hrs 27/02/2024 to the following: From 1430 hrs to 2100 hrs 29/02/2024 .

    "date": "25-02-2024 06:20:00 PM",
    "content": "Earlier today I posted about how there’s a startling growth of large collective deviations of under- performance across all Semi-Scheduled units, using the particular case of Sunday 24th December 2023 to illustrate in various ways. On the flip side, when looking at Aggregate Raw Off-Target for all Semi-Scheduled units in the delayed GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q4 , it’s become increasingly apparent that the pattern we saw emerging through 2023 Q1 and 2023 Q2 and 2023 Q3 has become quite clear: 1) Whilst there is a clear growth in the incidence of large collective under- performance across Semi-Sched units (indeed, the growth is accelerating by some measures); 2) At the other end of the spectrum, we see the incidence of large collective over- performance (across Semi-Sched units) is rapidly declining . … and the result on this side is a very good thing ! Across calendar 2023 there were only 2 instances where AggROT for Semi-Scheduled units was < –500MW : 1) That’s well down on the 19 instances we saw in 2022; and 2) Is the inverse of the increase (from 70 to 102 instances of +500MW under-performance ) we see on the other side of the ledger. Both of those instances of collective over-performance larger than –500MW occurred on Tuesday 31st October 2023 . Here’s the same sort of trend through 288 x Dispatch intervals of Aggregate ‘ Dispatch Error ’ through that day: Keep in mind (as noted before) that Aggregate ‘ Dispatch Error ’ is not the same as Aggregate Raw Off-Target … but is pretty similar, for Semi-Scheduled units. We’ll look forward to delving more into these two discrete dispatch intervals (14:40 and 14:45) as time permits.",

    "content": "On Friday evening I’d posted ‘Aggregate Dispatch Error across all Semi-Scheduled units (NEM-wide) throughout Tuesday 13th February 2024’ looking at some quite large instances of collective under- performance across all Semi-Scheduled units (not just in VIC, but NEM-wide) through Tuesday 13th February 2024 , the day of Victoria’s ‘Significant Power System Event’ . That seemed like a good segue to shift my focus back to the completion of the delayed GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q4 in spare moments over the weekend. Appendix 3 within these Quarterly Updates is focused on Large-Scale VRE … it’s the largest individual appendix, as there is lots to cover. Amongst other things we take a more systematic review of Aggregate Raw Off-Target for all Semi-Scheduled units, NEM-wide*, through the focused quarter. 1) It won’t be until April 2024 that we start looking at Q1 2024, and seeing 13th Feb 2024 in context. 2) But it was useful to take a look at 2023 Q4 in that context, as well. * note that in Appendix 5 within these Quarterly Updates we focus specifically on the declining number of coal units left supplying the NEM. (a) Amongst other metrics, we also look at Aggregate Raw Off-Target across the remaining coal units through the quarter, NEM-wide. (b) There’s a stark comparison about the relative levels of performance (by this metric) across the two different types of assets. … more in the GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q4 when we release it. I don’t have time to explain in detail here, but am choosing to post this single chart of Aggregate ‘ Dispatch Error ’** through all 288 dispatch intervals on Sunday 24th December 2023, right at the tail end of 2023 Q4. ** ‘ Dispatch Error ’ is not quite the same as ‘ Aggregate Raw Off-Target ’, but it’s easier to calculate quickly and is quite close to AggROT for Semi-Scheduled units . There’s more explanation in GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q4 and, time permitting, we might come back and drill into some specific (high under-performance) dispatch intervals in Case Studies under this Category here on WattClarity . For now, key insights readers can see include: 1) Many more dispatch intervals saw collective under- performance than collective over- performance … no time for explaining in detail here, but suffice to say that this is not a surprise – a result of all three factors: Factor 1 = The underlying properties of the variable energy resource and difficulties in forecasting this; Factor 2 = Super-charged by the way in which the Semi-Scheduled category is allowed (indeed, encouraged) to operate … remember that we asked the question ‘is the Semi-Scheduled category sustainable, or scalable?’ as Key Observation 13/22 within GenInsights21 (and then shared this with readers here on 9th March 2023). Factor 3 = And driven further to a lop-sided distribution by the current causer-pays methodology for apportioning Regulation FCAS costs that introduces a motivation to ‘game***’ self-forecasts: *** some might choose to replace ‘game’ here with ‘optimise commercial outcomes’. i) note – not Contingency FCAS costs; ii) a useful segue to remind readers that in the recently released GSD2023 we unpick FCAS costs in three bundles for all DUIDs apportioned by each month through 2023. 2) Large collective under- performance instances are more common (and larger) than large collective over- performance. 3) These instances of large collective under-performance are clustered in sunlit hours … understandably. 4) There’s many big deviations through this particular day: (a) Just in one day, there are 14 dispatch intervals with deviations larger than 300MW (i.e. size of a small coal unit), of which 5 are larger than 400MW, of which 2 are larger than 500MW … though those on the coal boosters of the Emotion-o-meter should remember that these deviations are slower , whereas any unit trips are faster (whether coal or other) . (b) Largest deviations (remembering this is ‘Dispatch Error’) were: i. A massive +710MW at 14:50 on Sunday 24th December 2023 … so not far below the 813MW Dispatch Error at 11:40 on 13th Feb 2024 due in part to the the unexpected loss of 501MW from Stockyard Hill Wind Farm as part of Event 1 on that day. ii. Second largest was +523MW at 15:50 . iii. With these two clumped in the middle of several hours in the middle of the day showing consistent under-performance (many intervals large) . 5) The VIC price was in the query (a legacy of this article about 13th Feb 2024 ) but I left it there as it’s useful to provide some hints about one factor contributing to the collective deviations … but remember there are others! If we have time in future, we might drill into 14:50 to see what might have contributed, on this instant?",

    "content": "Setting aside the ongoing distractions stemming out of 13th February 2024 , I’d returned my focus to the completion of the delayed GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q4 in spare moments over the weekend. More on that later … But mapping out the week ahead I had been thinking that there’d be some return to service (RTS) for this coming Thursday 29th February 2024 (based on plans noted on 15th January ) … 1) I’d quickly checked the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view 2) … and saw a RTS date for Callide C3 that did not map with my recollection (i.e. Sunday 31st March 2024 , not Thursday 29th Feb 2024). 3) Remember that: (a) this is the C3 unit has been offline since 31st October 2022 following cooling tower failure , and (b) was planned to return earlier than the sibling C4 unit, which has been offline since 25th May 2021 . So I zoomed into the 3 x 3-year view of MT PASA DUID Availability data in the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget , focused just on Callide C3, to see when this change was made: Turns out the change was made in the MT PASA DUID Availability data set for the run at 09:00 on Tuesday 13th February 2024: 1) i.e. same day, but earlier than the ’Significant Power System Event’ in Victoria . 2) no real surprise, then, that we missed it! Double checking the CS Energy Latest News service, wondering there had been something there that we’d missed, we see that same day CS Energy released its animation of what went wrong with Callide C4 on 25th May 2021 (which Callum was able to note for us here , given a few of us were buried in Victoria), there was also another media update on the latest delay in return to service for Callide C3: We’d missed the article ‘Update on Callide Unit C3 partial return to service’ in our general busyness on the day – but it is well worth reading. Amongst other things it noted: ‘Unit C3 has been in ‘preservation mode’ while the C3 cooling tower is being rebuilt. Throughout this time a regular inspection and maintenance program has been occurring to ensure the power station’s plant and equipment remain in good working condition to enable return to service. This inspection program has detected carbon dust in the C3 generator which has arisen during the preservation process. To ensure safety in the return to service of the unit, the JV has made the prudent decision to fully inspect and clean the generator which will impact the return to service for partial load.’ That update (on 13th February 2024) was twelve days ago now and there’s no further update yet (and the RTS expectation is still the same as what it was noted in that News Update).

    "date": "23-02-2024 07:15:00 PM",
    "content": "Tuesday 13th February 2024 was one of those days that has elicited many articles (with the ‘ Significant Power System Event’ being analysed progressively on WattClarity ). Amongst the analysis was Allan’s very useful article ‘Victorian renewable generation on 13 February 2024: One picture and a thousand (sorry, many more) words’ – which separates out some of the different factors contributing to a very volatile aggregate (large scale) VRE profile in Victoria throughout the day. One of the factors flagged was units being ‘Off Target’: 1) Frequent readers here will remember many articles previously written using a metric we call ‘ Raw Off-Target ’ … indeed, it’s one of many metrics we include for each individual DUID in the recently released GSD2023 . 2) A lead-in to the calculation of ‘Raw Off-Target’ is the metric AEMO defines as ‘ Dispatch Error ’. Knowing that we have much still to explore about this day, and also that we’ll be reviewing more holistically as part of GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2024 Q1 in another 7 or 8 weeks, I thought I would start here with this graphical summary of Aggregate Dispatch Error across all Semi-Scheduled units (NEM-wide) for all 288 dispatch intervals on Tuesday 13th February 2024: There’s some pretty big numbers there (almost always collective under- performance … for logical reasons Allan’s explained ): 1) Even after leaving aside the 11:40 dispatch interval (which was skewed by the unexpected loss of 501MW from Stockyard Hill Wind Farm as part of Event 1 ). 2) We’ll look forward to seeing where this day sits in relation to the ~90 others in Q1 when we get into analysis mode with respect to ‘ Aggregate Raw Off-Target ’ for Semi-Scheduled units as a focus for Appendix 3 inside of GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2024 Q1 ! I’ve already noted in this article the question from Christiaan Zuur (at the CEC) and Allan O’Neil (valued guest author on WattClarity) over on LinkedIn here with respect to the material underperformance of VRE being a reason why AEMO needed to procure additional FCAS Raise Regulation Services for the day : Keep in mind that Allan’s article only looked at Semi-Scheduled units inside of Victoria, whereas the chart above shows the net result of Semi-Scheduled units all the way across the NEM. Long-term readers will remember that we asked the question ‘is the Semi-Scheduled category sustainable, or scalable?’ as Key Observation 13/22 within GenInsights21 (and then shared this with readers here on 9th March 2023). That’s still a question that is echoing in our minds when we look at how this energy transition is unfolding … and the increasingly frequent large aggregate deviations away from target across all Semi-Scheduled units (which seem likely to require increasing volumes of FCAS procured to manage) is just one of the questions. But we’ll leave this question here for now…",

    "date": "23-02-2024 04:44:00 PM",
    "content": "Yesterday marked another day in Australia’s energy records, along the Eastern seaboard. The hot and sunny conditions led to notable maximums in energy demand and supply. Key Records Broken: NEM’s (National Electricity Market) Record: We witnessed the highest ever 5-minute Native Demand [1] in the history of the NEM. This surpasses the previous record set on 31st January 2020, just before the onset of the first Covid lockdown. This milestone illustrates a remarkable rebound and growth in energy demand. NEM’s (National Electricity Market) Record: We witnessed the highest ever 5-minute Native Demand in the NEM’s history. This peak reached 38,638.0 MW on 22nd February 2024 at 15:35 hrs, slightly surpassing the previous record of 38,601.2 MW set on 31st January 2020. This is a 0.10% increase and marks the first time the maximum has risen past the pre-Covid 2020 lockdown record. Victoria’s Native Demand: Victoria also experienced its highest 5-minute Native Demand, reaching 10,972.5 MW on 22nd February 2024 at 15:35 hrs. This is an increase of 540.8 MW (5.18%) from the previous record of 10,431.7 MW on 17th February 2023, aligning with the hot weather over a number of days during the working week. Renewable Energy and Curtailment in Victoria: In addition to demand records, Victoria set a new record in Renewable Energy (RE) plus Curtailment, hitting 7,335.4 MW on 22nd February 2024 at 13:25 hrs. This is up by 419.64 MW (6.07%) from the previous record of 6,915.7 MW on 13th February 2024. . This highlights the growing contribution and impact of renewable energy in the region’s energy mix. As always, these records reflect the evolving energy landscape in Australia, the resilience of our infrastructure, the changing patterns of consumption and a recovery from the pandemic, now a distant memory. They also underscore the importance of robust energy policies and the increasing role of renewable sources. Note: We currently use a basic interpolation method to derive 5-minute values for Rooftop PV, acknowledging that it’s not ideal but necessary given the limitations of the data provided by AEMO. This approach, while a compromise, allows us to construct a more comprehensive picture of electricity demand, incorporating the significant yet underrepresented impact of distributed energy resources like rooftop PV. We hope that in the future, AEMO will supply more granular rooftop PV data, enhancing the accuracy of our demand metrics and our understanding of the NEM’s dynamics. Until then, we must work with the best available data, balancing the ideal against the practical realities of data availability and resolution in the evolving energy landscape.

    "title": "It appears bushfire smoke was negatively impacting rooftop PV production in a material way in Victoria yesterday",
    "date": "23-02-2024 04:18:00 PM",
    "content": "The bushfire situation in Victoria and Tasmania continues to concern us (and many others) as emergency services rush to aid those affected. Yesterday afternoon we spotted a tweet from WeatherZone engineer Andrew Miskelly , which contained an animated gif that depicted the expanding nature of bushfire smoke hovering over Victoria. https://wattclarity.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GG62Lqdb0AAgCwX.mp4 Satellite images show the extent of billowing bushfire smoke originating just east of Ararat, Victoria. Source: WeatherZone Separately at around the same time, Linton was puzzled whilst examining our Forecast Convergence widget within ez2view . Linton looked at ‘Demand and Non-Scheduled Generation’, whereas I’ve looked at Market Demand (a.k.a ‘total demand’ in MMS terms) below. Either way, the ‘actuals’ were landing firmly above prior P30 forecasts in the afternoon. The 15:30 P30 period NEM time was most extreme deviation, as shown in this image: Market demand actuals were landing far above prior P30 forecasts yesterday afternoon. Source: ez2view’s Forecast Convergence This is earlier than when rooftop solar PV production typically fades as the sun sets. It’s also worth reminding our readers that market demand is net of rooftop PV self-consumption (e.g. lower rooftop PV production would result in higher market demand, all else being equal). Others in our team were puzzled as to the underlying cause of this higher-than-expected demand – and whether the bushfire smoke may have been negatively impacting rooftop PV generation throughout the state. This phenomenon has previously been studied by the AEMO, as we’ve noted on WattClarity – they had previously commissioned a 2020 report by Amperon that examined this effect , which particularly focused on large-scale solar production. The still images shown below show that the smoke originating from the bushfire near Ararat began intensifying at around 12:50 NEM time, and had hovered over major population centers in Ballarat, Geelong, and Melbourne by around 15:30 NEM time – which coincides with the point in time highlighted in the previous graph. The fire looks to have started (or increased in intensity) sometime after midday yesterday. By 4:30pm local time, the smoke had reached Melbourne and other areas further south-east. Source: Himawari Real-Time Ben Domensino posted an update about the extreme weather and bushfire risk down south earlier today, which includes images like the one below from Ballarat, that show the smoke dominating the skies. Images: Smoke seen over Ballarat, Vic on Thursday, February 23, 2024. Source: @jacquijallen / Instagram Those images strongly suggest to us that rooftop PV production would have been impacted in some way by the lack of solar irradiance caused by the smoke particles. Using the AEMO’s Rooftop PV estimate data, our team has plotted the chart below. It shows the mean daily profile of rooftop PV production in Victoria, and how yesterday’s profile diverged significantly from around 14:00 NEM time. The daily profile of rooftop PV generation for Victoria yesterday (shown in red), demonstrates that production dipped noticeable below the mean (shown in blue) throughout the afternoon, starting from 14:00 NEM time. Source: AEMO MMS Sadly, bushfires were also burning throughout Tasmania yesterday afternoon, but I must note that there was not a similar trend in data as the number of rooftop PV systems installed in that state is far lower (mainly owing to its more southerly latitude). Our thoughts are with those affected by this natural disaster, and we hope for safety for everyone in these areas. The latest information and emergency warnings on fires impacting these regions can be found on the related Victorian and Tasmanian government websites.",

Thursday was a dangerous day of heat and fire danger in southeastern Australia as a mass of hot air combined with strong and dry winds ahead of an approaching cold front. This combination of hot, dry and windy weather allowed large fires to develop in central Vic and central Tas on Thursday. These fires were so large their smoke plumes stretched for hundreds of kilometres and could be seen clearly in satellite images captured from about 36,000 km above Earth’s surface. Image: Satellite images showing large smoke plumes in Vic on Thursday. The fire located near Beaufort to the west of Ballarat has continued to burn through Thursday night and into Friday morning, despite much cooler air in the wake of a cool change that arrived on Thursday. According to reports, this fire has claimed some homes and as of 10am AEDT, emergency warnings were still in place. In Tasmania, several fires were still burning on Friday morning, with three watch and act advisories in place as of 10 am AEDT. Images: Smoke seen over Ballarat, Vic on Thursday, February 23, 2024. Source: @peterlawrencecarr (top) and @jacquijallen (bottom) / Instagram The heat that saw temperatures reach 35.9ºC in Melbourne and 35.5ºC in Hobart on Thursday has now moved further north and is focusing on NSW. Shortly after 10am AEDT on Friday, temperatures were already up to 32ºC in Maitland and Gosford over 30ºC in parts of Western Sydney. Temperatures are predicted to reach the mid to high thirties across most of the Sydney Basin on Friday, while some western parts of the state will nudge 40ºC in the afternoon. Image: Forecast maximum temperature in NSW on Friday, according to the ECMWF-HRES model Fortunately, without the strong winds that accompanied the heat in Vic on Thursday, Friday’s fire danger ratings in NSW are not expected to reach Extreme levels. However, parts of NSW, Vic, Tas and SA could see high fire danger on Friday. Another effect of today’s heat in NSW will be an increased risk of thunderstorms as the warm air rises into an unstable atmosphere. Thunderstorms are possible over all but the far west of NSW on Friday, with the greatest risk over the eastern half of the state, including the ACT. Some of Friday’s thunderstorms may become severe and a few supercells could develop in the state’s east during the afternoon or early evening.

    "content": "We were a bit distracted by the unfolding events of yesterday (Thu 22nd Feb 2024) … but before then I had been thinking through a few questions and implications about what happened in the ‘Significant Power System Event’ on Tue 13th February 2024 . 1) In the AEMO’s preliminary Operating Incident Report they identified 4 discrete events – and (included within these events) were ‘trips’ (or at least fairly rapid off-loadings) of 4 Generation Stations and 1 Load. 2) Using the AEMO’s 4-second SCADA data , we took at look at each of these … and unit performance in general across a 14-hour period. 3) I noted in the AEMO’s preliminary report that what happened at Dundonnell was called a ‘trip’, whereas the words used to describe what happened at Stockyard Hill Wind Farm, at Loy Yang A and also at Yaloak South Wind Farm were different (and notably not a ‘trip’). So I wondered … how fast is a trip? Using the AEMO’s 4-second SCADA data (and remembering all the caveats!) , I’ve derived an implied ROCDOWN rate for each of these 9 supply-side units on Tuesday 13th February 2024 as follows: Clearly what happened at Dundonnell Wind Farm is an order of magnitude faster than what happened at the other units … and: 1) That’s not even taking into account there’s a 3 second gap in the data points between ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ so the ROCDOWN rate is likely to be considerably larger than what is noted here (will need to wait for subsequent AEMO reports using the high-speed data to see). 2) Previous caveats about the rubbery nature of timestamps in the 4-second data not forgotten! For interest purposes I have compared this demonstrated ramp with the ‘MAX_RAMP_RATE_DOWN’ for these units currently in the DUDETAILSUMMARY table of the EMMS. Understandably what was demonstrated on 13th February 2024 was faster for all units … because what happened on Tuesday 13th February was not normally intended operation from one DI to the next. With respect to these fast off-loadings on Tue 13th Feb 2024 I’ve compiled this table to provide easier reference: DUID Timings Noting caveats on the timestamps on the 4-second SCADA data. Notes STOCKYD1 As Event 1 , the unit shows: 11:34:23 at 470MW 11:35:51 at 0MW. … so offline in 88 seconds (ROCDOWN = 320.5MW/min), as noted in the graphic above. On Tuesday 20th February we published ‘A first (more detailed) look at Stockyard Hill Wind Farm on Tuesday 13th February 2024’ . Not sure we’ll have time (or if there is a need) for us to do more here? Incidentally, we also posted ‘Stockyard Hill Wind Farm briefly off again, on Thu 22nd February 2024 (constraints a factor)’ for yesterday’s event. DUNDWF1, DUNDWF2, DUNDWF3 At the start of Event 2 , these units were clearly the fastest… All three units were: 13:08:56 online, with the units: DUNDWF1 = 128MW, before ROCDOWN = 2,560MW/min DUNDWF2 = 37MW, before ROCDOWN = 740MW/min DUNDWF3 = 113MW, before ROCDOWN = 2,260MW/min 13:08:59 offline at 0MW. On Friday 16th February, Allan wrote ‘Early observations from examining the AEMO’s four-second SCADA data from Tuesday afternoon’ – which showed both Dundonnell and Loy Yang A. We’d like to dig into what happened at Dundonnell Wind Farm in more detail … but that depends on available time (a scarce resource!). LYA1, LYA2, LYA3, LYA4 Three seconds later in Event 2 , we have the four units at Loy Yang A: 13:08:59 online. Then varying times offline, with varying ROCDOWN Rates: LYA1 was … (a) Off at 13:10:07 from 562MW (b) So ROCDOWN = 495.9MW/min LYA2 was … (a) Off at 13:09:55 from 555MW (first off) (b) So ROCDOWN = 594.6MW/min LYA3 was … (a) Off at 13:10:23 from 560MW (joint last) (b) So ROCDOWN = 400MW/min LYA4 was … (a) Off at 13:10:07 from 541MW (joint last) (b) So ROCDOWN = 386.4MW/min On Friday 16th February, Allan wrote ‘Early observations from examining the AEMO’s four-second SCADA data from Tuesday afternoon’ – which showed both Dundonnell and Loy Yang A. Likewise will see if we have time to do more… YSWF Taking 59 seconds longer than DUNDWFx to start ramping down in Event 2 , the unit shows: 13:09:55 at 23MW 13:10:11 at 0MW. … so offline in 16 seconds (ROCDOWN = 86.3MW/min), as noted in the graphic above. There’s been nothing, yet, specifically looking at Yaloak South Wind Farm … but interesting to see that (assuming SCADA timestamps are in sync) that this happened 1 minute a fter Dundonnell and Loy Yang A . APD01 I did not add into the graphic above, but (for completeness) including Event 4 , we see: 15:00:27 at 295MW 15:00:31 at 4MW (note that it did not drop down all the way to 0MW). … so down in 4 seconds ( implied ROCDOWN = 4,365MW/min ). Nothing has been written yet about this, other than a note in ‘From the 4-second SCADA data, a view of Production by Fuel Type on Tuesday 13th February 2024’ . Not sure we’re going to have time to look further… Hope this helps?",

    "content": "Having recent experience of how bushfires in the area of Stockyard Hill Wind Farm can lead to a cut of production , we’ve been wary of what’s been happening in the VIC region today (Thu 22nd February 2024), with bushfires again affecting a number of locations. In particular this ‘Leave Now’ notice from CFA Updates at 19:14 ( NEM time ) was of interest, because it mentions the Waubra area … home of Acciona’s Waubra Wind Farm: Given that it’s a current warning, the link works and leads to this message: The message overlay is over the top of the map – and neatly covers up the area of the state that’s home to the Waubra Wind Farm. Using the NEMreview v7 software, here’s a view of how the WAUBRAWF DUID has performed over the past couple of days: As highlighted, the unit dropped from 44MW to 0MW in the 18:00 dispatch interval, and we wonder if (and hope not!) related to the nearby bushfire ? Of course, there are various reasons why a Wind Farm might reduce its output to 0MW – so let’s tick some of them off the list: 1) It might be due to the dropping of the wind resource? (a) With reference to the recently released GSD2023 we see that the closest BOM weather measurement station is the Ballaratt Aerodrome. (b) On the chart I have added in BOM observations for both Wind Speed and Wind Gust for that measurement point. (c) There is some correlation over the past 3 days between the other lulls in wind and the drops in output of the Wind Farm (output drops tend to lead BOM readings) (d) The wind has dropped today, as has wind speed (e) But at the time of the snapshot above it’s not conclusive… (f) So I’m thinking it’s possible it might be low wind related, but does not seem certain . 2) It might be related to negative prices (if the generator is exposed to them) … but that’s not happening at present. 3) It might be related to transmission constraints … but the unit is Non-Scheduled so would only be constrained in very exceptional circumstances. 4) Other reasons (e.g. maintenance and so on) … but I have no way of knowing that? So let’s leave it here for now … whether the unit’s off because of bushfires or not , I do hope everyone is safe! PS1 at 07:20 on Friday 23rd February 2024 Have not seen any news directly about Waubra Wind Farm, but it has been offline (no output) through the night – from 18:00 Thu 22nd February until now (~13.5 hours).",

    "content": "There are bushfires in TAS impacting on transmission capacity , and bushfires in SA impacting on transmission capacity – and there’s plenty of news articles about bushfires in VIC as well (unfortunately) … stay safe, everyone. We’ve recently written about how bushfires led to Stockyard Hill Wind Farm rapidly coming offline on Tuesday 13th February 2024 (before the ‘main event’ that we called Event 2 on the day), so it’s worth a quick note to say ez2view alerts earlier today flagged a big reduction in output at STOCKYD1 in the 16:00 dispatch interval ( NEM time ). This is shown here in the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget snapped at 17:10 … noting that it also shows the unit ramping back up shortly afterwards: Note that ‘current day’ data is limited in a Public MMS. However the CPD Price shown for the DUID in the 16:00 dispatch interval (i.e. being below the Market Floor Price of –$1,000/MWh suggests that the unit is being ‘constrained off’ in this case … due to the ‘V>>X_MLSY_MLGT_MLGT’ constraint equation , which we show here in the ‘Constraint Dashboard’ widget : In this case we see that: 1) the STOCKYD1 unit is towards the top of the list of units shown (i.e. with a large positive LHS factor), which means that it would likely be ‘constrained down’ before units lower down in the list. 2) Indeed we see the three DUNDWFx units are also at 0MW (slightly above, perhaps SCADA error?) 3) There’s initially a bit of mystery about MACARTH1, which is still producing, but a quick look in its own ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget reveals that: (a) It was offline in the next dispatch interval; and that (b) its bid ROCDOWN rate yesterday was 12MW/min (i.e. 60MW in a dispatch interval), so we deduce it was probably just ‘constrained down’ to the limit of its ROCDOWN rate in this instance.

    "date": "22-02-2024 05:03:00 PM",
    "content": "When I posted this article at 15:20 ( NEM time ) earlier today, the ‘ Market Demand ’ in Victoria was up at 8,777MW . Not long after that, the demand took a rapid escalation – which prompted Linton to write ‘VIC demand running above forecasts …’ . … readers should note that Linton chose to show the AEMO field ‘Demand and Non-Scheduled Generation’, which is not the same as ‘ Market Demand ’, and not the same as AEMO’s more favoured ‘Operational Demand’ measure either. Talk about the gory details being confusing! Returning to NEMwatch at 16:20 ( NEM time ), we see that not long after Linton published his article, the demand in Victoria displayed a rapid about-face (presumably as a cooler change rolled through the region): Per the notes: 1) At this time, the ‘ Market Demand ’ was 8,850MW; but 2) We also see that it reached the highest point thus far today of 9,260MW … which occurred at 15:40 ( NEM time ). 3) Which is still more than 1,000MW below the all-time maximum by this measure of 10,496MW (set way back on 29th January 2009 ). 4) I’ve highlighted the dramatic about-face on demand in Victoria this afternoon. Curious how this compares to the recent historical range, we opened up NEMreview v7 and created this trend of daily maximum levels for both popular measures of demand: 1) ‘ Market Demand ’, which we use because it feeds directly into NEMDE and affects dispatch and pricing; and 2) ‘Operational Demand’ , which the AEMO uses because it speaks to their ‘keeping the lights on’ role. Those with a licence to the software can open their own copy of this trend query here. As can be seen, the peak level achieved today (if it is 9,260MW, or if it climbs higher as solar sets) will easily be the highest level seen since 31st January 2020 (which was its own exceptional day) .",

    "title": "Four reasons why rooftop solar will grow to dominate the electricity market",
    "date": "22-02-2024 01:26:00 PM",
    "content": "For the past four years, Green Energy Markets has produced projections of solar PV and stationary battery system installations for the Australian Energy Market Operator. These are used to help inform AEMO’s Integrated System Plan and Statement of Opportunities planning exercises for both the NEM and the Western Australian SWIS. In December we completed our most recent projections which landed on some quite staggering numbers for the amount of cumulative solar and battery capacity we’ll have installed on rooftops across households and businesses. The chart below details the amount of cumulative degraded solar PV capacity we projected in the NEM states for residential and commercial systems sized below 100 kilowatts for the three scenarios AEMO has selected for the coming year’s planning documents. Source: Green Energy Markets – Projections for distributed energy resources – solar PV and stationary energy battery systems – Report for AEMO, December 2023 Under the most pessimistic scenario of Progressive Change, we still landed on a very large amount of capacity by 2053/54 of around 66,000MW. Under the two scenarios where governments in Australia and also globally are assumed to step up to make concerted efforts to contain global warming below 2 degrees – Step Change and Green Energy Exports – we reach a similar level of around 98,000MW. However, it should be noted that the higher level of capacity under these scenarios is based on an assumption of significant additional new government policies not yet implemented. These are staggering levels of capacity because they go well beyond the levels of installed capacity in the NEM we have now for coal, gas, and hydropower plants combined of around 41,000MW, and also well above typical historical daily averages in electricity demand. It should be noted that these are Green Energy Market’s own projections, but AEMO will also make use of projections prepared by CSIRO. Based on AEMO’s most recent draft assumptions released in December they have proposed using our projection for the Green Energy Exports scenario while using CSIRO’s for Progressive Change and a blend of CSIRO and our own projections for the Step Change Scenario. CSIRO’s Progressive Change projection used by AEMO still ends up with a very large amount of rooftop solar capacity by 2053-54 at 48,000MW, even if it is substantially lower than our own estimate for this scenario. In terms of Step Change, AEMO’s blended projection has around 92,000MW by 2053-54, which is not too far off our projection of a bit above 98,500MW. So, no matter which way we cut this, these forecasts indicate we are headed for an amount of rooftop solar capacity (taking into account panel degradation) that is close to, or greater than typical average electricity demand. Then on top of this we also have solar capacity in solar farms and large commercial installations above 100 kilowatts per system which is in addition to what we’ll cover in this note. For many such a large amount of rooftop solar capacity seems to stretch the boundaries of credibility. Why would we install more rooftop solar capacity than typical total electricity demand across not just residential customers but every sector of the economy? The first response is that rooftop solar systems in aggregate for most of the daytime hours will produce an amount of electricity less than 50% of their rated panel capacity, so it isn’t as big an amount of capacity in reality, as it is on paper. Yet even now, in both the NEM and the WA’s south-west grid we regularly experience periods where wholesale electricity prices go to negative levels during daytime periods as other power generators struggle and fight to remain online in the face of a flood of rooftop solar generation. If that’s the case with about 20,000MW of rooftop solar capacity in the NEM then imagine what things will look like with 48,000MW to potentially even 98,000MW. We’ve thought long and hard about whether such large amounts of rooftop solar capacity are realistic. We must admit that after adjusting and updating all the various assumptions and then letting the model run, we were surprised to see the large size of capacity the model landed on at the end of the projection period. Stakeholders have provided us with a range of very thoughtful and sensible feedback over the years which has given us pause for thought about these results. In considering this feedback and questioning the results there are four fundamental and relatively simple and logical reasons for why we expect that cumulative solar capacity will continue to grow to the kind of levels our model projects. 1) Solar systems last a long time and their capacity steadily accumulates The first point to keep in mind is that these cumulative capacity numbers do not reflect a bullish view of the solar market that is continuously luring a growing number of new customers to install a solar system every year. In fact they reflect the opposite – we expect the number of solar systems being installed (after deducting system retirements) to decline across all scenarios relative to levels achieved in recent years, as shown in the chart below. Source: Green Energy Markets – Projections for distributed energy resources – solar PV and stationary energy battery systems – Report for AEMO, December 2023 However, the thing is that solar panels last a long time. They can still function very well after 20 years. So each year’s addition of capacity can build and build upon prior years before retirements become a significant negative factor. Plus, we expect that most systems when they reach their end of life will be replaced with a new system, because a new solar system per kilowatt will be cheaper than the original system bought by the homeowner, and so is likely to be perceived as good value. So, we end up with a steady accumulation of more and more capacity, even though overall the number of new sites installing solar each year is expected to decline substantially from what we’ve experienced in the last few years. In addition, because Australia’s population is expected to continue to grow, we are adding around 200,000 new dwellings each year (of which roughly half are detached or semi-detached) which increases the available market for incremental new system additions. 2) Curtailment has minimal impact on the economics of a solar system once it is coupled to a battery. Given how large solar capacity grows relative to total electricity demand, a range of stakeholders have understandably highlighted to us that solar generation will have to be increasingly curtailed and its value in the wholesale electricity market, and therefore feed-in tariffs, will decline to very low levels. The interesting thing we found is that over the next decade, the impact on the economics of household solar systems from curtailment becomes so small that it can almost be ignored (provided curtailment is limited only to generation that would otherwise be exported to the grid). Don’t get us wrong, there is little doubt that the value of solar generation in the wholesale electricity market is on a rapidly declining trajectory which is leading to declining feed-in tariffs and the revenue a household can earn from exporting power. This is one of the reasons why we expect the annual number of solar system additions will decline relative to recent years. However, this also means that in the future if a solar system’s exported generation is increasingly curtailed, it has relatively little financial impact because exports receive so little revenue. The key caveat to this finding though is that it is heavily contingent on an assumption that home battery storage systems will decline dramatically in price over the next decade and become a standard part of a new solar system install. To help explain this resilience we first need to understand what happens with the physical output of the solar system. At present without a battery our archetype customer exports around two-thirds of the solar output. Based on average feed-in tariffs prevailing in the year 2020, using NSW as an example, that returned around $600 per year to a householder with an average-sized system of around 6.6 kilowatts, while the rest of the solar generation that was consumed on-site avoided grid imports with an annual value of $730. So, feed-in tariffs have historically been very important to the value of solar. But by 2030 we expect feed-in tariffs will have fallen to very low levels. If the system owner doesn’t invest in a battery the exported generation will fall in value to $440 per year and by 2035 it will be worth just $320 under the Step Change scenario. The output self-consumed on-site is also expected to plummet in value to $410 by 2035 due to the roll-out of time-of-use tariffs that provide discounted power from 9am until 3pm (but which also charge a hefty premium during the 3pm to 9pm peak demand period). Once a battery is coupled to the solar system it soaks up almost half of the generation that would otherwise be exported to the grid. The chart below shows for a 6.6-kilowatt solar system with a 10-kilowatt-hour battery we end up with solar generation being roughly divided up into thirds across immediate consumption on site, charging up the battery, or being exported to the grid. Source: Green Energy Markets Solar + Battery Market Model So the physical quantity of kilowatt-hours of exports being exported to the grid has been substantially reduced, but it’s the financial value that really seals it. The chart below details that under the Step Change scenario by 2035 exports to the grid deliver just $100 of benefit to a household per year if they were unconstrained and represent just 7% of the overall revenue derived from the solar system’s generation. So even if the 50% of the exported generation was curtailed the household has only lost 3.5% of the overall financial value from the solar generation. Source: Green Energy Markets Solar + Battery Market Model This leads us to the conclusion that the solar market is likely to remain resilient in the face of an environment where AEMO and/or distribution networks need to intervene to curtail solar exports to the grid. As mentioned previously the big caveat to this analysis is that it assumes significant reductions in household battery storage system prices, with an expectation they will halve between now and the 2030 to 2035 period. This is an area of significant uncertainty but is informed by two macro-drivers: The motor vehicle market’s shift to battery electric drivetrains is likely to lead to substantial improvements in battery technology and economics driven by huge economies of scale that can support intensive research and development and learning by doing. Energy storage is based on highly modular battery cell technology which means household battery systems through mass manufacture can largely bridge the gap in price we currently see with utility-scale energy storage systems. 3) Distribution networks have demonstrated a capability to manage very high levels of household solar adoption There is a common belief we come across from people who work outside of the electricity network companies, that distribution networks are close to a bursting point with the amount of solar PV they can accommodate within their networks. These are usually described in qualitative terms as emerging “solar traffic jams”. But when you ask for specific quantitative, physical evidence of network limitations very little is forthcoming. It doesn’t help that distribution networks outside of Victoria have lacked access to smart meter data that could give them a good line of sight on what is happening with voltage downstream of their low-voltage transformers. The best evidence we have been able to find examining the prevalence of these so-called solar traffic jams (which should really be described as excessively high voltage) has come from: the Victorian Government’s Voltage Management in Distribution Networks review process through making use of their smart meter data; and Research published by the University of NSW’s Collaboration on Energy and Environmental Markets using data gathered by Solar Analytics devices. This information suggests that solar system curtailment due to excessive voltage is relatively minor at present and there is scope to better manage voltage at modest cost to integrate additional solar capacity. In addition, in the future once batteries become attractively priced and widespread, this will substantially mitigate the voltage rise created by solar. The interesting thing is that when you examine data on the proportion of households with solar by postcode in Australia, you find that distribution networks are already managing to handle geographic areas with very high concentrations of solar system adoption. The chart below cross-references the population by postcode against the proportion of households with solar within each postcode. Already 5 million Australians live in postcodes where 50% or more of households have a solar PV system. Postcodes with a combined population of around 750,000 have 70% of households or more with a solar system. Proportion of households with solar by postcode relative to population Source: Green Energy Markets – Projections for distributed energy resources – solar PV and stationary energy battery systems – Report for AEMO, December 2023 While distribution networks vary in their physical characteristics across different locations that means not all areas are readily equipped to handle such high levels of penetration, this suggests scope for far more growth in solar adoption. 4) The capacity of the typical household solar system is steadily and inexorably growing In 2021 Australia installed a record amount of STC-registered rooftop solar capacity at 3,192MW. This was 380% greater than the capacity installed ten years previously. But what is often not appreciated is that the number of individual solar systems installed was up by less than 5% compared to 2011 levels. The dominant driver of growth in capacity was not more households and businesses installing solar but rather that they had been persuaded to buy bigger systems, particularly in the residential sector. The chart below illustrates how the residential solar market has been progressively shifting to systems of larger and larger capacity over time. Back at the beginning of 2010, almost 70% of solar systems were less than 1.5 kilowatts in size. By 2019 the market had become dominated by systems between 6 and 7 kilowatts. Yet over 2023 we saw even systems up to 7kW in size falling to less than half the residential market. Proportion of residential solar systems within different capacity size bands Source: Green Energy Markets Solar Report subscription product We expect that this ongoing growth in system sizes will ultimately slow due to a range of reasons including: the scale-back in the Federal Government’s STC rebate per unit of capacity; falling feed-in tariffs and increasing curtailment; an expected slowing in panel conversion efficiency improvement; and household rooftop physical size limitations. But while it might slow, the solar industry is clearly very motivated and very capable of upselling customers to bigger systems. Therefore, we find it hard to believe this won’t continue as modules continue to fall in price per watt. The chart below details our expectation of how the average residential system size will grow over the next few decades. This growth in system size helps to offset what we expect will be a decline in the number of new system additions, such that capacity additions are similar to, or exceed historical peaks under the Step Change and Green Energy Export scenarios. Meanwhile, under Progressive Change capacity additions remain at levels similar to those achieved between 2018 and 2019. Average size of a new residential solar system by installation year Source: Green Energy Markets – Projections for distributed energy resources – solar PV and stationary energy battery systems – Report for AEMO, December 2023 But will rooftop solar and batteries grow as fast as we need them to? While this paper explains that rooftop solar capacity is likely to accumulate over time to reach levels that dominate the electricity market, it doesn’t mean it will necessarily grow at the speed governments ideally need it to in order to achieve their emission reduction goals. Given the long lead times we are currently confronting with the build out of large utility-scale renewable energy projects, rooftop solar – which will need to be coupled with batteries – becomes especially important in helping Governments maintain progress towards their emission reduction goals. However, it is very far from given that we will follow the Step Change or Green Energy Export trajectory of growth. Stakeholders need to recognize that these scenarios are intended to represent a very large scale-up in the rate of emission reduction effort in this country. Our own modelling has assumed a range of new government policies would be introduced, which we are yet to actually see implemented. While we have seen a large scale up in support for large scale renewable energy projects via the Capacity Investment Scheme, the main support mechanism for rooftop solar (the Small Scale Renewable Energy Scheme) is on track to be steadily phased out over the next few years. In terms of household energy storage we have gone backwards with both the Victorian and South Australian governments cancelling their rebate programs. Batteries will eventually become an attractive financial proposition for households. But this probably won’t be until the 2030’s, unless we see a level of government support for batteries similar to what was provided to the solar sector in its formative period. Rooftop solar, if it is increasingly coupled with battery storage, could be a very valuable tool in decarbonizing our electricity sector rapidly and importantly, also injecting greater competition into the electricity market and lowering household energy costs. But we also perceive a risk that is seen by some policy makers as an uncontrollable, nuisance weed, whose growth needs to be curtailed. We certainly need to be more thoughtful about how we roll-out solar and the importance of coupling it with batteries and other demand management tools. But it could be so much more useful than an uncontrollable, proliferating weed if we introduced new policies to help roll-out technologies that can shift electricity demand to make better use of solar.

    "title": "A first (more detailed) look at Stockyard Hill Wind Farm on Tuesday 13th February 2024",
    "date": "20-02-2024 09:35:00 PM",
    "content": "As noted on the weekend, the AEMO preliminary operating incident report touches briefly on the earlier loss of ~500MW of production at Stockyard Hill Wind Farm at around 11:35 ( NEM time ) on Tuesday 13th February 2024 (we’ve called that Event 1 ) … but AEMO’s main focus, along with many others, is on the later and larger issue that began at ~13:08 with transmission towers being blown over (we’ve called that Event 2 ). Whilst it’s logical that the main focus of attention is on Event 2, at Global-Roam Pty Ltd (publishers of WattClarity) we’d like to investigate all 4 Events that occurred on the day … and Event 1 is a logical place to start (hopefully nowhere near as complex as Event 2 and Event 3). Assumed pre-reading In addition to the AEMO’s Preliminary Operating Incident Report, we’re assuming you’ve read through each of these three earlier articles: 1) On Thursday 15th February, we’d posted our ‘sequence of events for what happened in Victoria through the day on Tuesday 13th February 2024 (via Timescale #1) ’ . 2) Then on Saturday 17th February 2024 we posted this ‘quick first pass through ENERGY bids (for Victorian units) on Tuesday 13th Feb 2024’ . 3) Then on Sunday 18th February 2024 we posted this ‘From the 4-second SCADA data, a view of Production by Fuel Type on Tuesday 13th February 2024’ . 4) Earlier today (Tue 20th Feb) Allan wrote about ‘Victorian renewable generation on 13 February 2024: One picture and a thousand (sorry, many more) words . It’s also worth noting that ‘AEMO preliminary report identifies 4 separate Events … including trips* at 4 Generators and 1 Load’ and … 1) with particular reference to Stockyard Hill Wind Farm, the report refers to ‘the loss of … Stockyard Hill’ , 2) as distinct from the disconnection of Dundonnell Wind Farm refers to this as being a ‘trip’ . … so I was curious to understand the distinction (i.e. between a ‘trip’ and a ‘loss’), starting with this article about Stockyard Hill Wind Farm – and following later with a similar article focused on Dundonnell Wind Farm. Finally, also worth noting this discussion that ensued here on LinkedIn earlier on Tue 20th February 2024 in response to Allan’s earlier article: Grass Fires around Stockyard Hill Wind Farm impact on output I’d heard whispers and rumours about what might have been the genesis of the issue, so I did a bit of Googling and found this update from CFA Victoria via Twitter published at 11:23 ( NEM time ) on Tuesday 13th February 2024: Clicking through on the link shown in the message suggests that ‘the incident may have expired’ , but a Google search with respect to Stockyard Hill Wind Farm finds articles putting the grass fire in the vicinity of Stockyard Hill Wind Farm – including: 1) On Tue 13th Feb 2024, Anna Houlahan wrote ‘A grassfire is burning at Stockyard Hill, west of Ballarat, “that is not yet under control” and travelling in a north-easterly direction towards Lake Goldsmith.’ in this article in the Examiner; 2) On Tue 13th Feb 2024, Tess McCracken wrote ‘An out of control grassfire at Stockyard Hill, Beaufort, 183km west of Melbourne has been upgraded to a watch and act alert as the blaze travels in a north-westerly direction towards Crossroads.’ in this article at News.com.au; 3) On Friday 15th Feb 2024, Simon Johanson wrote ‘Origin’s gas-fired plant in Mortlake, in Victoria’s west, is operating at full capacity under direction from the Australian Energy Market Operator. The company cut power it usually supplies to customers from the Stockyard Hill Wind Farm, west of Ballarat, because of two major bushfires .’ in this article in SMH ; 4) Giles Parkinson wrote ‘a reported grass fire took out the Stockyard Hill wind farm’ in this article on Sunday 18th Feb 2024; So it seems clear the grass fire came close to, and impacted the output of , the Stockyard Hill Wind Farm. Though I still have more questions! Zooming in on the AEMO 4-second Data for Stockyard Hill Wind Farm In this top-down article on Sunday 18th February 2024 , we included a chart containing a 14-hour time-series of output for every single Wind Farm in Victoria from 06:00 to 20:00 on Tuesday 13th February 2024: It was a very busy chart, but (in part because of its large size) I was able to colour in the STOCKYD1 DUID along with several other large (and/or topical) units. In that article, I noted the following: 2) I have coloured some of the topical (or otherwise larger units) … starting with STOCKYD1, the subject of Event 1 : (a) I’ve not seen any reports yet that note why the unit was ‘lost’ (the word used in AEMO’s Preliminary Report ) around 11:35, and am certainly interested to understand this; (b) This quick view of the 4-second data did not explain why that was the case – other than that it was a rapid loss; (c) But what was a surprise is that the unit appears to power up rapidly at ~12:26 for unknown reasons, and then disappear just as quickly? … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #21 ). So I thought the most logical place to start, in diving in further, would be with the same chart but stripping out all the other units, as such: (as I hit publish now, I note I used the word ‘tripping’ in relation to Stockyard Hill – hence adding to the confusion – hence my apologies) On this chart I have noted three ‘events’ with respect to Stockyard Hill Wind Farm: Event 1a ) being some (what I assume to be wind speed related) drops in output at ~10:07 and ~10:30 on the morning; Event 1b ) being the unit being ‘lost’ at ~11:35; and Event 1c ) appearing to be a brief attempt to return to service at ~12:26 on the day, which would be: (a) ~50 minutes after it had come offline; but also (b) ~42 minutes before the larger disruptions of Event 2 at ~13:08 that included the trip of Dundonnell, Loy Yang A and Yaloak South + loss of load at 1,000MW of load ‘shaken off’, and so on… It’s Event 1b and Event 1c that particularly interest me here in this article, so I’ll just ignore Event 1a (assuming it’s unrelated to Event 1b, and leave to some possible future/separate article?) and zoom in to show more detail: This chart I’ve annotated with some quantities and times – coming from the AEMO’s 4-second SCADA Data ( but note the caveats ). A first look at the AEMO market data in EMMS for STOCKYD1 With the above frame of reference in mind, I thought it would be useful to attach this snapshot from the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view , which has been: 1) Time-travelled back to 24:00 at the end of Tuesday 13th February 2024; 2) Set to look back 24 hours, so covering the whole day; and 3) With the ‘Bid Table’ also showing, so readers here can see the bids submitted for the unit across this 24 hour period … note that this also shows (in light grey rows) bids submitted but superseded before any point of dispatch. I’ve also annotated with the same 3 events (i.e. Event 1a, Event 1b and Event 1c) noted above. Interestingly the fleeting burst of production that appears in the 4-second SCADA data from 12:25:31 to 12:27:43 (i.e. a duration of 2 minutes and 12 seconds in Event 1c ) is not seen in any dispatch interval data – which is not a total surprise, given (assuming the timestamps are correct) that it’s located wholly within the 12:30 dispatch interval. Some of the rebids shown in the Bid Table we will refer back to in the chronological listing below. Selected dispatch intervals (for STOCKYD1) from 10:30 onwards With the above frame of reference in mind, I thought it would be useful to switch to use of the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget (and other linked widgets) in ez2view , setting the look-back to only 3 hours and look-forward to 3 hours (i.e. into predispatch from the ‘now’ point of the window), and have captured a few dispatch intervals from 10:30 onwards… I’ve picked out a few particular things … but there’s more that we could look at (alas, not enough time). And remember that (as with this, similarly structured, article here ) there are many caveats applying to this first pass … Reader Beware , there may be errors , and the picture is definitely incomplete at this point. Dispatch Interval on Tue 13th Feb 2024 remembering this is ‘ NEM time ‘, and it is 5 minutes ending Development during this dispatch interval (readers should remember … with the images shown below, we try to set them up so clicking on the image will open in a new tab as a larger size image … so if you have 2 windows you can more easily read). up until 10:25 We’re going to skip these earlier dispatch intervals, as Event 1a. 10:30 … still one hour prior to the ‘loss’ of the STOCKYD1 unit in the 11:35 and 11:40 dispatch intervals It’s worth starting here with the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view : In this image we see: 1) That the unit has 300MW bid at -$64.55/MWh and another 150MW of volume bid at -$61.80/MWh: (a) I don’t have time to consider why two bid bands so close together (perhaps PPA?) (b) But loosely speaking we’d call them both ‘negative LGC’ 2) We also see that the unit’s currently not constrained, but is forecast to be constrained in the AEMO’s P5 predispatch run for 10:35. So we click through to the ‘Constraint Dashboard’ widget in ez2view , focused on the ‘V>>NIL_MLGT_MLGT_R2’ Constraint Equation to understand more about this constraint: The ‘Standing Data’ tab (not shown here) reveals that this constraint relates to ‘avoid O/L Moorabool to Geelong #1 or #2 on trip of other Moorabool to Geelong line, Yallourn W Unit 1 in 220 kV mode’ and is part of the System Normal ‘V-NIL_RADIAL’ Constraint Set that’s been invoked since 27th April 2021 and is currently scheduled to persist forever after. As identified in the image above, there are many DUIDs on the LHS of this constraint equation, with many with larger positive factors than the +0.3762 factor assigned to STOCKYD1, which means that (assuming all units bid the the same price) the other units with the higher LHS factor would be ‘constrained down’ before STOCKYD1. 10:35 … five minutes forward, just because of the forecasted constraint Stepping forward with the the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view we see the constraint has bound, driving the CPD Price slightly lower … but it’s still above the units ‘most expensive’ volume (bid at –$61.80/MWh at the RRN) so it is not constrained down. The P30 predispatch forecasts also show no forecasts for drop in output – but that does not mean it can’t happen, so it’s understandable (happens often) that there’s a rebid made (appears to come from an autobidder) arriving at 10:32 to be considered for the 10:40 dispatch interval shifting volume down to –$1,000/MWh. At this point, we’ll skip a few dispatch intervals … 10:40 to 11:25 Skipping these Dispatch Intervals. 11:25 No snapshots of the market for this point – just remember that the CFA Update copied above was published at 11:23 (i.e. in this dispatch interval) and it said: ‘Grassfire – Watch and Act for Stockyard Hill. You should leave Now if you are not prepared to stay’. Perhaps we will learn more later, if any particular instructions were provided to the onsite operators at the Wind Farm? 11:30 … just prior to the ‘loss’ of the STOCKYD1 unit in the 11:35 and 11:40 dispatch intervals Stepping forward to 11:30 (i.e. just before the output dropped to 0MW, we again use the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view : In this image we’ve highlighted: 1) A series of prior intervals where the unit has seen a positive Raw Off-Target (i.e. because its output was below Target). (a) In his earlier article , Allan noted that this was quite common through the day for VRE in Victoria (i.e. this was what Allan coloured red). (b) Note that the Conformance Status is derived as ‘Normal’ because the unit is under Target (i.e. not above, which would be more of a concern), and is presumed to be deviating as a result of the changing wind resource. 2) Also noted that at this point the CPD price is well under the ‘negative LGC’ points where the bids had previously been (i.e. prior to the rebid to -$1,000/MWh shown above). … If not for the rebid, this unit would have been ‘constrained down’. 3) In this dispatch interval, there’s a second constraint equation that has begun to bind … which, due to similarity in Constraint ID, suggests it’s related to the earlier one. 11:35 … STOCKYD1 starts to come offline ( Event 1b ) Stepping five minutes forward and we see the unit start to come offline : In particular: 1) The MaxAvail in the bid is still set at 511MW; 2) But the Availability is adjusted downwards slightly because UIGF (which comes from AEMO’s AWEFS system in this instance) is at 501MW. 3) As a result of that Availability, the unit is given a Target of 501MW (i.e. because it’s bid below its CPD price); 4) But, in contrast, the unit tracks the other way … from 474MW at the start of the dispatch interval down to 305MW at the end of the dispatch interval. 11:40 … STOCKYD1 is fully offline ( Event 1b ) Stepping five minutes forward and we see that the unit is now fully offline: In this dispatch interval, we see the UIGF from AWEFS (which is setting the Availability for the unit in the NEMDE run, being lower than the MaxAvail) is at 501MW … yet the unit is now offline. Interestingly, looking into the next dispatch interval there’s a rebid submitted at 11:37 (what a coincidence!) that will take effect for the 11:45 dispatch interval … 11:45 … offline – but not in the bid So stepping forward we see there’s a key difference in determining Availability: Quick notes: 1) The rebid reason was ‘Band adj to manage binding constraints – SL’ , but 2) The effect of the rebid was ‘just’ to extend further forward the time range into the future at which volume was offered at -$1,000/MWh. 3) As such, the bid still says capacity is available … 4) … but thankfully AEMO’s AWEFS process now says the true availability is 0MW … how this comes about is a topic for a follow-on article, when time permits. 5) … so the Target is set to 0MW. 11:50 … offline – but not in the bid Stepping forward 5 minutes, the picture is much the same: … so moving along … 11:55 … offline – but not in the bid Again at 11:55 the picture is much the same as the two dispatch intervals before: … so moving along … 12:00 … offline – but not in the bid Stepping forward to 12:00 we see a big change in colours for the bid bands to take effect in the 12:05 dispatch interval: This is the result of the rebid submitted at ~11:55, and which we will review just below … 12:05 … STOCKYD1 rebids, and sets MaxAvail to 0MW At the 12:05 dispatch interval, the picture changes: Importantly, the available capacity shown in the bid from this point forward is seen as 0MW. Using the ‘Bid Comparison’ feature in the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view shown above, we see a clear difference between the two bids: Not only has volume been shifted to higher priced bid bands – MaxAvail has also been set to 0MW, as a reflection of the physical limitation of the plant. 12:10 & 12:15 & 12:20 Nothing to add at this point for these 3 x Dispatch Intervals. 12:25 … just prior to the rapid spurt in output Returning to the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view : There’s nothing shown here that suggests a spurt in output coming soon. 12:30 … the dispatch interval within which there appears to have been a rapid spurt in output ( Event 1c ) Stepping forward 5 minutes: We can’t see a spurt in output … but we do see a rebid to take effect in the next dispatch interval… 12:35 … afterwards So taking more of a look, nothing much looks different in the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view : … except that I’ve flagged how MaxAvail from the bid is not 0MW anymore: Remember it’s always the lower of MaxAvail and UIGF, and UIGF has continued to be 0MW, so that means Availability continues to be 0MW. Taking a look at the rebid through the ‘Bid Comparison’ feature in the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view shown above, we see a clear reversal in what happened before: Max Avail is no longer 0MW … 12:30 onwards And that’s where we’ll leave this chronological review.

    "title": "Victorian renewable generation on 13 February 2024: One picture and a thousand (sorry, many more) words",
    "date": "20-02-2024 03:43:00 PM",
    "content": "The events of Tuesday last week threw up a plethora of questions about power system and market outcomes – quite separate from the very extensive damage to distribution system assets that storms wrought across the state causing power outages in wide swathes of territory, which have rightly attracted the most public attention. A great starting point for a technical overview – aside from WattClarity’s own growing collection of posts – is AEMO’s Preliminary Operating Incident Report , published in what must be record time last Friday. This post will aim to cover many of the more detailed questions about large-scale renewable generation trends raised by Paul in his earlier market-wide scans of generator bidding behaviour , and then looking into the four-second SCADA data . I’m aiming to do this with a single chart, so without further ado, here it is: (probably best to open this on a second screen if you plan to follow along) In the remainder of this post I’ll unpack what this is showing, starting with an overall guide to the chart. The busier upper panel is showing the aggregate availability (potential output) from all Victorian large-scale wind and solar producers between 8am and 5pm on the day, the actual output from these assets, and the breakdown of the gap between the two – potential output that didn’t get generated for one of multiple reasons. The data granularity is five-minute market dispatch intervals. The lower panel shows the Victorian spot price in blue, but also (where it differs) the physical dispatch price in red (note the log scale). I’ll come back to what this second price is about – it’s clear that not even all market participants fully grasp its meaning. From here I’ll follow the numbered annotations on the chart to unpack what was going on across the key parts of the day. 1. Significant VRE curtailment From the start of the period charted we see a growing gap between availability and generated output, coloured light grey and representing curtailment of output from wind and solar sources (variable renewable energy, or VRE ). Potential output grows from the start of the day, but actual output stays relatively flat. Curtailment here means available output that is not dispatched even though it is offered at a lower price than the market dispatch price . In general this curtailment arises from various limits on the transmission system reflected in constraints on market dispatch. It tends to particularly impact renewable generators which typically bid their output at low offer prices seeking to maximise their generation. With growing concentrations of solar and wind farms in parts of the power system with limited transmission capacity, periods with plentiful wind and sunshine like last Tuesday morning often see significant curtailment. 2. Output below targets Picked out in red is any net difference between output targets for renewables and their actual delivered output . Output targets are produced by the market dispatch algorithm – NEMDE (National Electricity Market Dispatch Engine) – as it seeks to balance supply and demand at least cost, taking into account: participant supply (and scheduled load) offers , market demand levels, and transmission and other system security constraints In the case of VRE, an important parameter for supply offers is forecast availability which can vary quite widely in each dispatch interval. Much more detail on this topic is available (!) in a great WattClarity post by Linton Corbet . Even five minutes can be a long time in weather terms (especially here in Victoria), so these forecasts can be too high or low. Furthermore, other drivers of plant performance might change, meaning that VRE generators may end up off target . VRE generators’ control systems can readily withhold any “excess” potential output above their targets. Under the market rules semi-scheduled VRE generators are obliged to do so: when impacted by constraints, or when some or all of their output is bid at offer prices above the market price and NEMDE “economically offloads” them – just like any other generator offering above the market price. But in the converse case where an over-forecast (or sudden clouds or wind lulls, etc) mean they have insufficient potential output to meet targets, they can’t magic additional wind or solar energy from nowhere (unless they’ve got a “behind the meter” battery – something an increasing number are considering), and they end up off-target on the low side. Because of the strong asymmetry I’ve just described, it should be obvious that VRE is much more likely to be off-target on the low side, than generating above its dispatch targets. The red area on the chart shows the net extent of this below-target behaviour last Tuesday. We can see that this grew particularly in middle of the day. This growth reflects the challenges of accurately forecasting wind and solar output – even at short five-minute horizons – as strengthening gusty winds, fast-moving clouds, and storms developed across the state. And it was almost certainly one factor impacting system frequency and the need for AEMO to enable increased quantities of Raise Regulation FCAS as the day developed. 3. Stockyard Hill windfarm offline The state’s largest windfarm went and remained offline after about 11:35 (NEM time) from output of nearly 500 MW, shown in the large availability and output drops at this time – and also a large off-target value, as it wasn’t forecast to happen. It’s since been reported that this was required due to firefighting operations in its vicinity. Not related to Stockyard, but after this we also see a gradual, small decline in remaining aggregate availability, with a much larger fall in output leading up to 13:00, driven by increasing curtailment. 4. Towers down At around 13:09 the main power system event unfolded, as six 500 kilovolt transmission towers near Anakie – well, “folded” seems apt – taking out two parallel lines between Moorabool and Sydenham. The immediate and general sequelae to this have been well covered in other posts . Concentrating here on impacts on VRE generation we just note that another large wind farm in Victoria’s south-west – Dundonnell – tripped from about 275 MW. AEMO’s Preliminary Report makes it clear that this was in line with the design of a specific protection scheme for its section of the 500kV network. The small Yaloak South windfarm tripped as well, but at 23 MW output this was not material to events. 5. Other availability declines On the heels of the event and the Dundonnell / Yaloak South trips, there’s a further net availability decline of about 400 MW over the next few dispatch intervals. About three-quarters of this drop seems to have been at various solar farms even though their share of overall VRE availability at this time was only about 800 MW to wind’s 2,100 MW. Detailed analysis of which farms were affected and why will have to await a further post, probably by someone with more time than me. 6. Curtailment increases (again) Just when the power system could have used more power, less of what was available was able to be dispatched from VRE sources, leading to a sharp drop in their aggregate output – well beyond the availability declines discussed above. This was the result of the impaired power grid position following the collapse of the Moorabool-Sydenham lines and especially the rundown of all four generating units at Loy Yang A . Two different sets of constraints started impacting generators in the west and north-west of Victoria even more strongly than had been the case from the start of the day. Loy Yang A’s 2200 MW going hors de combat meant that more power was trying to flow: eastward from western / south-western Victoria (where plenty of wind generation was still available despite the trips) via the lower capacity 220 kV system linking Melbourne to Geelong, Moorabool and places further west, and southward from Victorian hydro plant, Snowy, and New South Wales via Dederang and South Morang. This link also carries some flow from north-west Victorian renewable sources. NEMDE did its best to balance things under duress, but had to more strongly curtail output from generation trying to get through these bottlenecks. Which brings us to the next issue … 7. OCD … over-constrained dispatch . A phrase that still causes some AEMO people to break out in cold sweats remembering events of May-June 2022 . When faced with Hobson’s choice of: allowing power flows to exceed some of its normal security constraints, or failing to dispatch enough generation to meet demand, NEMDE is programmed to violate some of those constraints – allowing a possibly insecure dispatch outcome in order to keep the lights on. This is achieved in as controlled a fashion as possible , with prioritisation of constraint violations according to their potential consequences, driven by pre-set constraint violation penalty factors . I noted some of these constraint violations in a quick on-the-day post last Tuesday – notice that the constraint Left Hand Side values (LHS) are not less than the RHS numbers – even though they should be: (technically this isn’t a chart, just for anyone counting) Amongst other things, this goes some way to explain the ‘weird and wacky transmission transfer limits’ that Paul noted on the day – following a customer query. This has many other consequences which I won’t cover here, but an immediate one is that the “ physical dispatch price ” – the underlying “raw output price (ROP)” for electricity, produced by NEMDE in every dispatch run – shoots up to many multiples of the $16,600/MWh Market Price Cap (MPC). This physical price got to well over $400,000/MWh last Tuesday, but because the MPC is – you guessed it, a cap – the market trading price was set to $16,600/MWh. Despite this, and getting back to VRE, we don’t see any less curtailment through this OCD period – many renewables were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. 8. Controlled load-shedding and “VoLL override” pricing Over-constrained dispatch and violating system security constraints are not something AEMO can allow to persist. To urgently return the power system to a secure state, and with no prospect of the quick return of Loy Yang A, the sole arrow left in AEMO’s quiver was to instruct network companies to begin controlled rotational load-shedding , impacting about 90,000 customers. This began from 14:20 NEM time and within a couple of dispatch intervals returned the system to a secure dispatch configuration. There was now enough generation to securely meet the (now artificially lower) demand, but whenever load is shed in this way, the market trading price gets set to the MPC – $16,600/MWh – under the so-called “ VoLL override ” provisions of the market rules. The basic idea here being to create incentives for as much generation as possible to bid available so that NEMDE can find a secure dispatch solution and ultimately so the load-shedding can be ended. What’s less appreciated about “VoLL override” pricing is that with lower demand – because of both the AEMO-initiated shedding, and separate storm-driven distribution blackouts – and generators (mostly) offering at very low prices to get dispatched at the trading price of $16,600/MWh, the underlying physical dispatch price produced by NEMDE can suddenly crash to the other end of the spectrum as too much generation is offering at low prices to all get dispatched . The “ floor price offloading ” of VRE generation highlighted in this period represents volume offered at -$1,000/MWh by wind and solar generators that wasn’t being curtailed by constraints, but still couldn’t be dispatched because the overall volumes offered at the floor were being scaled back by NEMDE to keep supply and demand in balance. We also see large amounts of curtailment continuing here – the physical state of the network not having improved – but also some odd-looking bidding behaviour leading to price-based offloading while the market price was at $16,600/MWh. What? 9. Which price?? Multiple spot prices are confusing for everyone, especially it seems some bidding software, with automated bidding tools increasingly being rolled out across the NEM. I suspect this could explain why in the latter part of the VoLL override period, when the physical dispatch price had crashed to -$1,000/MWh, but the financial trading price was still at $16,600/MWh (because controlled load-shedding was still underway), we see a significant volume of VRE generation “economically offloading”. Recall that this means generation which is being offered at prices above the spot price so is not being dispatched by NEMDE. The sixty-four dollar question here is “ which spot price? ” It’s not the $16,600/MWh trading price being set by the VoLL override rules – NEMDE knows nothing about this. The relevant price for physical dispatch of generation is – you guessed it – the physical dispatch price* , sitting in this period at -$1,000/MWh (or -$999.99/MWh in a couple of intervals). * This physical dispatch price is incorporated into the ‘ Connection Point Dispatch Price’ (or CPD Price for short) that is featured in various widgets in ez2view , including the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget and the ‘Constraint Dashboard’ widget. I expect you’ll see screenshots of these widgets in future articles exploring this event. The only way, other than unusual constraint situations, for a generator to get its maximum share of dispatch during this period was to be offering its output at -$1,000/MWh. A skerrick higher and NEMDE would dispatch it off (or down as far as possible if it’s a slow ramping generator). Without naming names here there were a group of VRE generators who, judging by the form of their rebid reasons, all seemed to be using the same bidding tool(s) and for a short period chose to offer output at well above -$1,000/MWh, as if confident that the $16,600/MWh market price would still see them dispatched. As the undispatched volumes highlighted in green show, it didn’t. Wrapping up Well done if you persisted this far. This was a complex event with all sorts of implications, and lots more detail to come. The terrible disruption of the blackouts at distribution system level and the physical integrity and robustness of the grid as a whole, in a world of fast-warming climate, are no doubt the biggest issues emerging. For VRE generation generally, the impact of transmission constraints – and understanding their implications – again comes to the fore. For individual participants, it again highlights just how arcane the NEM can be, and why a solid grasp of not just the fundamentals but the many vagaries of market operation is essential, not optional. ================================================================================================= About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

    "date": "18-02-2024 05:29:00 PM",
    "content": "On Saturday 17th February 2024 we posted this ‘quick first pass through ENERGY bids (for Victorian units) on Tuesday 13th Feb 2024’ . Now we are returning to the higher-speed 4-second data that the AEMO published on Thursday, which was used to produce this ‘14 hours of trended (mainland) frequency on Tuesday 13th February 2024’ . In this article we’ll delve further into what’s visible with respect to the 4-second data for unit outputs in Victoria over the same 14 hour period (i.e. 06:00 to 20:00 NEM time , so spanning Event 1 , Event 2 , Event 3 and Event 4 as identified in the AEMO’s Preliminary Report (along with the trips* of 4 Generators and 1 Load). Remember the disclaimers added in this article , which also apply here – notably that we’re just looking at units located in Victoria for which the AEMO has SCADA data, so: 1) Any effects (or possible contributions? ) in other regions are not going to be seen; 2) The role of interconnection is not seen; 3) Worth highlighting that anything that might have happened with rooftop PV in VIC or elsewhere, which is invisible through this data, through the incident is not going to be seen Also keep in mind that my intention in combing through this data was to notionally allocate units into two baskets: 1) Does not appear to be anything of interest to see here; and 2) With this unit there are more details I’d like to know (albeit that, given our incessant curiosity, this bucket’s likely to be overflowing). With these caveats in mind, let’s proceed. What happened at Portland Aluminium Smelter? The 4-second data (in addition to data for visible generators) contains data for a very small number of large industrial load sites … including the Portland Aluminium Smelter in Victoria. Remembering that the AEMO preliminary report identified a trip at the Portland Smelter sometime later than Event 2, it was of interest to look here: With respect to this chart, there’s a few things that jumped out to me – including: 1) There’s a clear drop in consumption coincident with the frequency dropping with Event 2 … which suggests that the operations at Portland (possibly via Raise FCAS services?) would have played a role in stabilising frequency. … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #1 ). 2) From this data it appears that what we called Event 4 here (i.e. the trip of Portland Smelter) occurred at ~15:00 : (a) So before Event 3 in a chronological sequence; (b) With the smelter back online by ~15:09; (c) And tripping for unknown reasons. … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #2 ). 3) There’s also the earlier partial drop in consumption at ~13:34 which (given the proximity to Event 2 ) I am guessing is somehow related: (a) First guess is that it might be an intentional reduction to support supply-demand balance (given all the supply-side units that tripped) i. for instance, there was MN114656 the AEMO issued at 17:38 about ‘AEMO has issued a direction to a participant in the VIC region’ ii. but that notice was issued 4 hours after the reduction in load, suggesting AEMO’s direction was not related to Portland. iii. and noting that there was no earlier Market Notice about a Direction in Victoria. iv. Perhaps there was another manual trigger? (b) Or perhaps it was involuntary? … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #3 ). What happened at the Coal Units? The identified the trip of Loy Yang A as part of Event 2 , and we’ve seen this earlier – but it was of interest to look at the other coal units (as we had earlier in aggregate with respect to their bids ): With respect to this chart, there’s a few things that jumped out to me – including: 1) The steep trip of all 4 units at Loy Yang A with Event 2 is very clear: … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #3 ). 2) There’s a clear increase in output at YWPS3 and YWPS4 coincident with the frequency dropping with Event 2 … which suggests that the these units might have been supplying some form of Raise FCAS services?. … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #4 ). 3) Earlier in the day (around Event 1 , which is not marked in this case) there is a clear increase in output at YWPS4 and LYA2 and LYA4 coincident with the frequency dropping with Event 1 … which again suggests that the these units might have been supplying some form of Raise FCAS services?. … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #5 ). 4) Remembering that Event 3 relates to tripping of transformers and lines in the Latrobe Valley, I note that LOYYB1 and LOYYB2 and YWPS3 and YWPS4 had all been reducing prior to that event, and seem to rise in conjunction with the frequency hitting bottom … … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #6 ). 5) Later in the day (around ~17:22) the frequency again drops, and TWPS4 and LYA2 (which is ramping up at the time ) temporarily increases output … … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #7) . 6) At the same time (around ~17:22), however, there’s a clear drop in output at YWPS2 … … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #8 ). What happened at the Gas Units? There was no mention of Gas units in the AEMO Preliminary Report — but it was of interest to look at the other coal units (as we had earlier in aggregate with respect to their bids ): With respect to this chart, there’s a few things that jumped out to me – including: 1) There are six units (JLA04 + siblings, and MORTLK11, and VPGS1) that are started up about an hour before the spot price at the Market Price Cap attached to Event #2 , and I’m curious in each case what the trigger might have been in each case: … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #9 ). 2) Unless I have missed something (low res image!) the other units all appear to start in a staggered fashion after the price spikes started in relation to Event #2 : … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #10 ). What happened at the Hydro Units? There was no mention of Hydro units in the AEMO Preliminary Report – but it was of interest to look at the other coal units (as we had earlier in aggregate with respect to their bids ): With respect to this chart, there’s a few things that jumped out to me – including: 1) There are two units (MCKAY1 and MURRAy1) that are started up about 60 minutes before the spot price at the Market Price Cap attached to Event #2 , and I’m curious in each case what the trigger might have been in each case: … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #11 ). 2) The other units appear to start slightly after Event #2 , and I’m curious to delve further: … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #12 ). 3) Given that it’s easily the largest unit in the chart, the short term fluctuations in output around Event #2 , (and also Event #3 , though that’s not highlighted on the chart) are of interest … as are the contributions of the other units: … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #13 ). The two sides of a BESS, currently? Until the IESS rule change is implemented in June 2024 , batteries are represented by a pair of DUIDs … charging and discharging. So there is 4-second data for both units (which currently is positive in both cases). There was no mention of BESS ( charging or discharging) in the AEMO Preliminary Report – but it was of interest to look how the battery units performed, on both sides of their ledger (as we had earlier in aggregate with respect to their bids ). So here’s a trend of BESS discharge using the 4-second data: Here’s the other side of the ledger, with BESS charging as follows: Looking at both charts together and visually trying to line them up, there are a number of things that jump out to me – including: 1) Looking through each DUID in turn, the largest discharge is shown to be HBESSG1 (almost 3 times larger than the next biggest), so it stands out and we’ll start there: (a) there is a spike coincident with the frequency dropping with Event 1 – which presumably would have helped support frequency. (b) there is also a spike in output related to Event 2 … which would also support frequency. However it appears to be much lower than earlier discharges, and I wonder why? (c) further, the contribution from HBESS1 drops away in the ~2 hours afterwards when the spot price was at $16,600/MWh (including the period of load shedding), and I wonder why? (d) Given that the HBESSG1+HBESSL1 combination had a close proximity to Event 3 , I wonder what the impact was? … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #14 ). 2) Next largest in contribution was VBB1+VBBL1: (a) With the first point being the contribution on the generation side of this unit through the day was quite small in relation to its installed capacity (higher on the load side); (b) In these low-res images there that VBBL1 was charging around the time of Event 1 , and it appears that there was a reduction in consumption (perhaps ~10MW) at the time of the frequency drop, which would have helped to support frequency. (c) There is a pronounced spike in output related to Event 2 … which would also support frequency. However this is well below installed capacity, so I wonder if this is related to SIPS restrictions? (d) Unlike the case for HBESS1 discharge, the VBBG1 discharge appears more active in the hours after Event 2 – albeit not continuous output . … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #15 ). 3) For BALBG1+BALBL1: (a) Trying to eyeball what was happening around Event 1 , it does not appear either charge or discharge? (b) There’s an increase in output around the time of Event 2 … just need to check if this is just prior to frequency dropping. (c) It’s clearer that there was little output in the 2 hours after Event 2 . … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #16 ). 4) For BULBESG1+BULBESL1: (a) There does seem to be a spike in output coincident with frequency dropping with Event 1 . (b) With Event 2 it’s harder to see … certainly BULBESG1 output is lower than around Event 1 . (c) The interesting thing is that the unit seems charge to for a period in the 2 hours after Event 2 .(i.e. with spot price at $16,600/MWh and frequency low) … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #17 ). 5) For GANNBG1+GANNBL1, the unit is too small to see at this scale: … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #18 ). 6) For PIBESSG1+PIBESSL1 the unit is too small to see at this scale: … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #19 ). What happened at the Wind Units? The identified the trips of Dundonnell Wind Farm and Yaloak South Wind Farm as part of Event 2 (and remember Stockyard Hill Wind Farm in Event 1 ), but it was of interest to look more broadly at all the Wind Farm units (which we had earlier in aggregate with respect to their bids : Looking at both charts together and visually trying to line them up, there are a number of things that jump out to me – including: 1) First and foremost, there are way too many wind units to show usefully on one chart … we just have a mess of spaghetti that needs to be separated out to see much that is is meaningful: … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #20 ). 2) I have coloured some of the topical (or otherwise larger units) … starting with STOCKYD1, the subject of Event 1 : (a) I’ve not seen any reports yet that note why the unit was ‘lost’ (the word used in AEMO’s Preliminary Report ) around 11:35, and am certainly interested to understand this; (b) This quick view of the 4-second data did not explain why that was the case – other than that it was a rapid loss; (c) But what was a surprise is that the unit appears to power up rapidly at ~12:26 for unknown reasons, and then disappear just as quickly? … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #21 ). 3) As noted in the AEMO’s Preliminary Report , and written about previously, the three DUIDs representing Dundonnell Wind Farm tripped off rapidly with Event 2 : (a) I’d like to know more about what happened here; (b) And note that there seemed to be an earlier steep drop in output at around ~11:00 (c) But have not had time yet to check … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #22 ). 4) In the AEMO’s Preliminary Report it also noted the trip at Yaloak South Wind Farm (YSWF1) with Event 2 : (a) But we’d not written about that previously (or probably seen mentioned elsewhere either) (b) It’s too small a scale to see anything meaningful as well (it’s a smaller Non-Scheduled unit) … so something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #23 ). 5) In terms of other large units coloured in above, the MACARTH1 output seems stronger after Event 2 … perhaps related to its location in the western part of Victoria? … so something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #24 ). 6) Another large unit coloured in was MOORAWF1, which showed an interesting output profile: (a) steady output through the morning, apart from two steep drops in output (at ~10:35 and ~12:21… coincidentally at the same time as STOCKYD1 appears to have ramped up temporarily) (b) Then very lean output through the afternoon until ~19:00 … so something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #25 ). Moving to solar units now … What happened at the Solar Units? There was no mention of Solar Units in the AEMO preliminary reports , but it was of interest to look at all the solar units (as we had earlier in aggregate with respect to their bids ): Looking at both charts together and visually trying to line them up, there are a number of things that jump out to me – including: 1) Some units (e.g. KIAMSF1 and WEMENSF1 and the grey ones (BANN1 and KARSF1 and YATSF1)) show output profiles that suggest being ‘constrained off’ during many hours of the morning period … each a little different; whereas … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #26 ). 2) Other units coloured yellow (e.g. GANNSF1 and GLNRWNSF1 and NUMURSF1 and WINTSF1) suggest unconstrained output through the morning up until just before Event 2 , when output becomes much, much choppier for unknown reasons) … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #27 ). 3) The green unit (GLENSF1) shows a very ‘blocky’ profile which makes me wonder if this one was not involved in the Fixed Load profile seen earlier in aggregate with respect to their bids ? … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #28) . 4) I think COHUNSF1 was off for the day, so nothing to see here… That’s all for now (leaving this list of another 28 Observations/Questions to explore later)…",

    "title": "AEMO preliminary report identifies 4 separate Events … including trips* at 4 Generators and 1 Load",
    "date": "18-02-2024 12:26:00 PM",
    "content": "As noted on Friday, the AEMO was fast out of the blocks in releasing its Preliminary Operating Incident Report related to ‘Event 2’ that occurred on Tuesday 13th February 2024 in Victoria. This weekend I’ve been doing some analysis of my own: 1) starting with this top-down initial review of participant bidding behaviours ; and 2) leading into [TO BE ADDED] … but I did take time to read through the AEMO report, and thought it worth highlighting that the AEMO: 1) identifies four discrete Events on the day (so one more than the three events noted in our ‘sequence of events for what happened in Victoria through the day on Tuesday 13th February 2024 (via Timescale #1) ’ ), and 2) amongst these Events, the AEMO identifies loss of 4 different power stations (whereas to date we’ve only written about three) and 1 major load (which we have not yet written about) … plus the two discrete network sites. I thought it would be worth listing these all below. Event 1 – loss of Stockyard Hill Wind Farm In our earlier ‘sequence of events ’ we called this Event 1, so for consistency have kept the same numbering here. Within Section 2.3 of the report (p8/19), the AEMO writes: ‘Prior to the event, AEMO was managing a sustained low frequency event including the loss of approximately 500 MW of generation from Stockyard Hill WF that occurred at approximately 1135 hrs and had increased the minimum frequency control ancillary service (FCAS) regulation raise requirement. Constraint set F-MAIN_RREG_0450 was invoked between 1200 hrs and 1355 hrs on 13 February 2024 to ensure mainland regulation raise requirement was greater than 450 MW.’ Note (re * in the title of the article) that the AEMO refers to this as a ‘loss’ of generation from Stockyard Hill and not necessarily a ‘trip’ . Readers might remember we showed some of the increased enablement for Raise Regulation FCAS in Friday’s article ‘Aggregate enablement of RaiseReg FCAS from units in the mainland (excluding Basslink) on Tuesday 13th February 2024’ . Event 2 – towers down … the major event This event is the focus of this Preliminary Report. Section 1 of the report (p6/19), begins as follows: ‘This preliminary report relates to a reviewable operating incident1 that occurred on 13 February 2024 in Victoria. At 1308 hrs on 13 February 2024, the Moorabool (MLTS) – Sydenham (SYTS) No. 1 and 2 500 kilovolt (kV) lines tripped following failure of six 500 kV towers (three on each of the two 500 kV circuits). The simultaneous trip of these 500 kV lines and subsequent disconnection of all four Loy Yang A generating units, Dundonnell Wind Farm (WF) and Yaloak South WF had a significant impact on the Victorian power system . Initial review indicates Dundonnell WF tripped as designed due to operation of the South West 500 kV special control scheme. In total, approximately 2,690 megawatts (MW) of generation was lost, and 1,000 MW of load was shaken off2 in Victoria following the disturbance. Following the event, at 1420 hrs on 13 February 2024, AusNet was instructed to shed 300 MW of load to manage loading of in-service network elements. AEMO subsequently instructed load to be restored at 1450 hrs and 1510 hrs.’ I’ve copied this in to highlight two things: 1) The three stations highlighted as tripping are Loy Yang A and Dundonnell (both of which we have noted before), but also Yaloak South (which we have not noted before); 2) What also stood out to me was the statement: ‘Initial review indicates Dundonnell WF tripped as designed ….’ … whereas I note that there’s no similar statement there for either Loy Yang A or Yaloak South Wind Farm. Perhaps I’m reading too much into the absence of similar words – perhaps investigations are more complex for both of those sites? Event 3 – Hazelwood This event is not the focus of this Preliminary Report. In Section 1 of the report (p6/19), the AEMO writes: ‘Later, at 1543 hrs on 13 February 2024, a further separate incident occurred involving trip of the Hazelwood Terminal Station (HWTS) – Jeeralang Terminal Station (JLTS) 220 kV No. 2 line and the offloading of the HWTS 500/220 kV No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4 transformers. This incident will be subject to a separate review . ’ 4th Event – Trip at Portland Smelter (but perhaps not 4th in chronological sequence) It’s only mentioned once, on the last page of the preliminary report, where it includes a System Diagram that’s annotated with: ‘Later trip of APD potline’ Here’s it highlighted on the diagram: … but note that it does not specifically mention a time at which this occurred, other than it happened ‘later’ , which I read as ‘later (than Event 2)’ (i.e. Event 4 might 0have actually occurred before Event 3). PS1 later on Sunday 18th Feb 2024 Later on the same day we ask ‘What happened at Portland Aluminium Smelter?’ with the 4-second SCADA data and see that this event did indeed occur earlier than Event 3. As noted there, the smelter was offline at ~15:00 and back online by ~15:09.",

    "title": "A quick first pass through ENERGY bids (for Victorian units) on Tuesday 13th Feb 2024",
    "date": "17-02-2024 04:21:00 PM",
    "content": "We noted yesterday that we’ve started to delve into the AEMO 4-second data … and as such published this ‘14 hours of trended (mainland) frequency on Tuesday 13th February 2024’ … 1) In the process flagging 7 different periods over that 14-hour period that will be of particular interest. 2) Some of which we’ll delve further into as part of what I called ‘Timescale #2’ in this earlier list of questions . In parallel, we’re also looking into market participant behaviours – including bidding. In this first pass we take a top-down look at bids by Fuel Type / Technology using the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view , time travelled back to 00:00 on Wednesday 14th February and looking back 24 hours … such that: 1) It shows ‘final bids’ (i.e. for each dispatch interval it shows the bids that NEMDE took into account in its dispatch process for that dispatch interval) … i.e. so we only see the final outcome of rebidding behaviour, not (in this article) looking at ‘that other dimension of time’ in how the rebids were progressively developed. 2) It is filtered to VIC region only; and 3) Just looks at the ENERGY market. This uses an internal build of ez2view version 9.9.1.21, which is being prepared for the IESS market changes that go live in June 2024. Disclaimers First and foremost, readers should keep in mind the following disclaimers : 1) This analysis performed and published on Saturday 17th February 2024 as a quick first pass (a) It’s deliberately intended to not show the whole story, but instead to flag top-down things we’d like to delve into in more detail in the days and weeks ahead, time permitting (i.e. we actually have other things to do as well!) (b) It’s done quickly, so there’s increase of mistakes in opting for speed. i. If any readers spot mistakes, it would be appreciated if you could point them out (in comments below, or directly); ii. If we become aware of mistakes we may update this article, but it’s not guaranteed. 2) We’ve noted below that ‘the NEM is a complex place’ , and readers should keep in mind the interconnected nature of the NEM , in several dimensions: (a) Firstly, it’s probably obvious to most people that just zooming in on bids in Victoria will overlook any impacts that came in the ENERGY market of other regions ; (b) Perhaps less well understood will be the ’interconnections’ across all 11 commodities (i.e. ENERGY and 10 x FCAS commodities). i. Just focusing on ENERGY will almost certainly overlook outcomes related to co-optimisation. ii. As an example of this which I can point to, the increase in mainland Raise Regulation Requirements for part of the day Tuesday 13th February 2024 is bound to have had some impact on other commodities (including ENERGY). (c) Finally, worth also noting that this analysis just focuses on the ‘physical’ ENERGY market operated by AEMO, and that there are likely to have been impacts (both ways) with related financial markets as well. So reader beware! Tips in reading these ez2view charts… A few background tips on how to read these charts – which are from the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view : 1) We’ve added the spot price for VIC on these charts to provide you a reference point for the bidding activity. Keep in mind that (as noted in this ‘ sequence of events for what happened in Victoria through the day on Tuesday 13th February 2024 (via Timescale #1)’ ) that the spot price: (a) spiked for the 13:20 dispatch interval, and (b) remained high until it dropped negative in the 15:20 dispatch interval. 2) However also keep in mind that (also noted in this ‘ sequence…’ ) load shedding under LOR3 : (a) commenced for the 14:20 dispatch interval; and (b) the Actual LOR3 was cancelled at 15:15 (i.e. last dispatch interval with the price at the Market Price Cap ). 3) Users can create their own bid price buckets, and assign colours of their choice – but it makes sense (at least in this top-down review) to use the ‘Default Price Buckets’ which use three basic colour ranges: (a) BLUE = $0/MWh and below (with –$1,000/MWh being light blue … there’s a lot of that!). (b) GREEN = Above $0/MWh to $300/MWh (c) PINK and RED = Above $300/MWh. (d) GREY = eagle-eyed readers will spot a bit of grey, which are ‘Fixed Load’ (i.e. ‘must run’ price-taker bids). 4) Remember to click on an image to open a larger view in another tab. Reading through on two windows might help, if you have two screens? So let’s get started… ENERGY Bids in Victoria on Tue 13th Feb 2024 – all units With the above in mind, here’s the trended bid stack for all units in Victoria: Note that bids for consumption (and aggregate targets for consumption-side units) are shown as negative quantities … but a bit dwarfed by the supply-side contributions. There’s a massive drop in capacity offered into the market shown that appears to be almost coincident with the spiking of the price … but remember that (also noted in this ‘ sequence…’ ) the price spiked at 13:20 but the biggest drop in capacity offered did not occur until the 13:25 dispatch interval. Hence the slight mismatch in timing we see above. ENERGY Bids in Victoria on Tue 13th Feb 2024 – coal units Here’s the trended bid stack for all (coal-fired) units in Victoria: No bids for consumption with these units. With this chart it’s useful noting: 1) The total volume offered at the start of the day was lower than total installed capacity because: (a) Yallourn had two units out (YWPS1 and YWPS2), and (b) also because YWPS4 was offering capacity lower than its MaxCap. … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #1 ). 2) The loss of 2,200MW of capacity offered at Loy Yang A from the 13:25 dispatch interval was a noticeable drop. … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #2 ). 3) Nothing immediately jumps out with respect to Loy Yang B … so let’s move on. ENERGY Bids in Victoria on Tue 13th Feb 2024 – gas units Moving along, here’s the trended bid stack for all (gas-fired) units in Victoria: No bids for consumption with these units. With this chart we can see that: 1) Some capacity was unavailable through the whole of the day … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #3 ). 2) Of the capacity that was offered to the market: (a) At the start of the day all capacity was offered at or above $10,000/MWh; (b) But by 14:50 all capacity that was available was offered down at –$1,000/MWh (c) and there was an increase in volume offered (which was not a surprise, as some slower-start units that don’t expect to run in a given day take the approach of bidding unavailable) … all something to explore in a subsequent article ( Observation/Question #4 ) (c) What’s notable is that prior to the tower collapse and subsequent spike: i. some volume was shifted down to –$1,000/MWh as early as 12:20 (i.e. 60 minutes prior to the spike), hence receiving targets shortly afterwards. ii. By the 13:15 dispatch interval (i.e. last before the spike), there was 625MW offered down at –$1,000/MWh … much of it receiving targets. … hence that’s definitely something else to explore in the a subsequent article ( Observation/Question #5 ) ENERGY Bids in Victoria on Tue 13th Feb 2024 – hydro units Finished with fossil fuels, here’s the trended bid stack for all (hydro) units in Victoria: No bids for consumption with these units (i.e. the Snowy pumped hydro units are in NSW). With this chart we see: 1) Some volume unavailable for the whole of the day … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #6 ). 2) A more complex pattern of bids than was shown in the (red to blue) shift for gas above … but the end result being almost all volume offered down at –$1,000/MWh by 14:30 … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #7 ). ENERGY Bids in Victoria on Tue 13th Feb 2024 – solar units Into the VRE, here’s the trended bid stack for all (solar) units in Victoria: No bids for consumption with these units. With this chart we see a number of interesting things: 1) Through the middle of the day, peak energy-constrained availability was close to aggregate Max Cap … which suggests that most plant were available, though still something to be explored later ( Observation/Question #13 ). 2) There’s a noticeable volume of energy offered in (102MW in GREY) ‘Fixed Load’ up until 13:40 for reasons unknown: … something to explore in a further article ( Observation/Question #14 ). 3) There’s a very up-and-down aggregate production shape (i.e. the black line) shown through the day … which: (a) could be due in part to the underlying weather system (i.e. fast moving rain bands) … or possibly bushfire smoke; but (b) also might be due to network constraints, which we’ll need to use other widgets to explore (c) possibly other factors? … to be explored further in a subsequent article ( Observation/Question #15) . 4) Readers will see (remember click on image for a larger view) some staggeringly large ‘ Aggregate Raw Off-Target ’ deviations in the dotted grey lines that began about 12:30 and grew worse in subsequent hours … presumably also as a result of fast moving cloud cover (and possible smoke?), but to be explored further in a subsequent article ( Observation/Question #16 ). 5) I also see a somewhat counter-intuitive outcome in bidding from ~13:40 (i.e. with the spot price is at the Market Price Cap) in that volumes were shifted from –$1,000/MWh upwards to ‘ negative LGC ’, and even some above $10,000/MWh for reasons not immediately obvious? … perhaps as a result of some crude auto-bidding logic – definitely something to explore later in a subsequent article ( Observation/Question #17 ). ENERGY Bids in Victoria on Tue 13th Feb 2024 – wind units Next in terms of VRE, here’s the trended bid stack for all (gas-fired) units in Victoria: No bids for consumption with these units. With this chart we see a number of interesting things: 1) Throughout the day, peak energy-constrained availability was well below aggregate Max Cap: … probably just a seasonal low for wind … but I’d like to explore, later, if there were units unavailable in the day ( Observation/Question #18 ). 2) Until ~09:50 the aggregate production shape (black line) is fairly steady – but from that point the up-and-down aggregate production shape grows worse for the rest of the day… which: (a) could be due in part to the underlying weather system (i.e. fast moving wind bands); and (b) possibly including high-speed wind cut-out; but (c) also might be due to network constraints, which we’ll need to use other widgets to explore (d) possibly other factors? … all to be explored in a subsequent article ( Observation/Question #19) . 3) Readers will see some noticeably large ‘ Aggregate Raw Off-Target ’ deviations in the dotted grey lines that began about 10:00 and are worse from ~11:00 … presumably also as a result of wind patterns (but interestingly do not appear to be as large, in relative terms, as for solar above) … all to be explored further in a subsequent article ( Observation/Question #20 ). 4) Factoring in here is the sudden outage of STOCKYD in the 11:40 dispatch interval (which was noted as Event #1 in this ‘ sequence of events …’ ) … something to be delved into separately in a subsequent article ( Observation/Question #21 ). 5) There’s also the coincident trip of DUNDWF1, DUNDWF2 and DUNDWF3 in the 13:10 dispatch interval (which was noted as Event #2 in this ‘ sequence of events …’ and also by Allan is his first pass on the 4-second data ). … but I have not specifically looked, yet, to see if there were others that dropped offline at this time. … something to be delved into separately in a subsequent article ( Observation/Question #22 ). 6) As was the case in aggregate for solar farms above, I also see a somewhat counter-intuitive outcome in bidding from ~14:40 (i.e. with the spot price is at the Market Price Cap and the AEMO has instructed load shedding) in that volumes were shifted from –$1,000/MWh upwards to ‘ negative LGC ’, for reasons not immediately obvious? … perhaps as a result of some crude auto-bidding logic – definitely something to explore later in a subsequent article ( Observation/Question #23 ). ENERGY Bids in Victoria on Tue 13th Feb 2024 – battery units In firming new technology, here’s the trended bid stack for all (battery) units in Victoria: In this case the chart looks significantly different because the Installed Capacity for discharge (i.e. positive numbers) appear the same size as the Installed Capacity for charging (i.e. negative numbers). With this chart we see a number of interesting things: 1) Throughout the day, peak availability for discharge was well below aggregate Max Cap and the volume offered to charge was substantially more than offered to discharge throughout much of the day. … I’d like to explore, later, what the reason – e.g. commissioning delays or SIPS or something else ( Observation/Question #24 ). 2) Throughout the day, especially when charging, there were substantial aggregate ‘ Dispatch Error ’ …. … being BESS there are more reasons why this might be the case (compared to Solar and Wind) so am not calling it ‘ Aggregate Raw Off-Target ’ at this stage – would like to explore further in a subsequent article ( Observation/Question #25) . 3) Strangely, when the crisis hits for the period when prices are sky high, the volume of energy offered to discharge was substantially lower than earlier in the day … off the top of my head, I wonder what the reason(s) for this might be: (a) Were they actually empty; (b) Was this somehow to do with FCAS provision? (c) Or is this another example of what we wrote about with respect to the Energy Crisis in 2022 where energy limited plant (with batteries having the most severe limits) withdrawing capacity to preserve what little they energy they have? (d) Or is it something else entirely? … all to be explored further in a subsequent article ( Observation/Question #26 ). ENERGY Bids in Victoria on Tue 13th Feb 2024 – negawatt units For completeness (an remembering that we already know registrations in WDRM has been lacklustre ), here’s the trended bid stack for all negawatt units in Victoria: Readers are cautioned here to remember the mental gymnastics required in Tripwire #3 in that a ‘negawatt’ is a supply-side unit (i.e. positive number) not a consumption-side unit (i.e. negative number). With this chart we see a several things: 1) Throughout the day, peak availability for discharge was well below aggregate Max Cap (at 8MW offered of 30MW registered that’s only 27% participation , which seems even more underwhelming). 2) What’s more, there was a delay of a couple dispatch intervals before anything was offered: 3) For unknown reasons from 14:45 the dispatch of the few negawatts even offered to the market dropped to 0MW , despite it being offered at ‘green’ prices well below the Market Price Cap. It’s not immediately obvious why. … all of this could be explored later, if we have time ( Observation/Question #27 ) … but honestly it seems the least important thing on this list. Wrapping up … Having been through (above) this quick and top-down assessment of bidding through the day on Tuesday 13th February 2024 we’ll now be better placed to zoom into” 1) Particular DUIDs of interest; and also 2) Particular subsets of time through the day. … but that’s another article!",

    "title": "Optimising a highly renewable NEM from scratch",
    "date": "16-02-2024 02:04:00 PM",
    "content": "As we were reminded (several times) in AEMO’s 2024 Draft Integrated System Plan (ISP), “Renewable energy connected by transmission, firmed with storage and backed up by gas is the lowest cost way to supply electricity to homes and businesses throughout Australia’s transition to a net zero economy”. In light of AEMO’s assertion, starting with a fresh sheet of paper we built a maximum Sharpe ratio wind and solar portfolio, added in existing behind the meter and firmed it with batteries, hydro and gas to meet NEM-wide operational demand for the calendar year 2025. Professor William Sharpe won a Nobel prize in 1990 for his contributions to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) in finance and also developed the so-called Sharpe Ratio. The key insights of Sharpe and his colleagues was to show that a portfolio of shares would have a lower variability for a given return than any individual stock. A corollary is that it’s the contribution of the stock to the portfolio that matters rather than the merits of the stock in isolation. It seemed to us that these concepts were applicable to wind and solar. A portfolio of wind and solar farms will have a lower variation for a given capacity factor than individual projects. The Sharpe ratio for wind and solar projects is operationalised as the expected capacity factor/divided by standard deviation. Using Python and an optimiser and AEMO half-hourly REZ traces for wind and solar we built a 1 MW maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio and then using AEMO half hourly demand forecasts scaled the portfolio so that total demand equalled total supply. Then we calculated sequential half hourly demand and supply balance resulting in either energy available for storage or firming required. Enough firming was provided so that demand was met in every half hour for CY 2025. We then applied capital costs, and in the case of gas fuel costs, to build up the total cost of the system and then ran sensitivity tests with the objective of minimising total system cost. Our work remains at an early stage, even though in Leitch’s case he’s been developing this concept for more than four years. A glaring, but soon to be remedied element of this thought experiment is that transmission costs are not yet included. Once they are we expect the optimal solution to change. To the extent this work has any value it’s in comparing what a theoretical new system might look like with the existing system. Above all the exercise shows the benefit of diversification of renewable resource but, because of transmission, the cost of achieving it. Another epiphany is that optimisation in the use of storage assets can greatly reduce the overall cost. As part of the work, we take advantage of new data provided with the ISP 2024 data set such as sub-regional demand, and also briefly compare the 2024 ISP demand forecast with that of 2022. Key Takeaways Industry lore of 75% wind / 25% solar holds (almost) true in our VRE portfolio optimisation exercise. We incentivised a model to generate a solar/wind portfolio from AEMO’s Renewable Energy Zones (REZ’s) that maximizes its return relative to risk (Sharpe ratio), and no constraints were placed on the proportion of wind and solar, nor the geographical distribution of the generation. The generated portfolio came to 77% wind, 23% solar. Indeed, in subsequent sensitivity analyses, varying the wind to solar ratio either side of this optimum increased the long-term costs of the system (capital + fuel + firming dispatch). Increasing solar % of the portfolio decreases the upfront costs, but significantly increases firming capacity requirements and expenditure on fuel for firming gas generation over time. Generation in this Sharpe-ratio optimsed portfolio is very heavily weighted to Far North Queensland. This portfolio sees Qld, SA, and Tas being net exporters, NSW and Vic net importers of energy. Given the location of the demand centres, it is highly likely that an optimised system which accounts for transmission costs will shift generation further South. The optimised VRE + Firming Capacity system modelled in this analysis requires: 56 GW of Variable Renewable Energy capacity supplying 160 TWh of energy in 2025, 15 GW / 4 hours of storage capacity supplying 3 TWh of energy in 2025, 5 GW / 14TWh of (existing) Hydro , and 8 GW of open cycle gas supplying 4 TWh of energy in 2025. The total capital (excluding Hydro) is $169 billion . The VRE cost is $123 billion , and gas firming capacity cost $46 billion . The amount of battery storage required is dependent on the order in which firming resources are used. If Batteries are dispatched first the seasonal nature of VRE production means that there will be large surpluses at times but also very large deficits. If dispatched last the batteries spend too much time at full capacity with surplus VRE wasted. Realistically there is a large incentive to discharge full batteries when sunlight is abundant. By dispatching batteries first in Summer but last in winter, an additional 6 TWh of additional energy can be supplied by batteries instead of gas. Refining the dispatch algorithm seems to offer the promise of further reducing the overall theoretical cost. 2022 ISP vs. 2024 ISP The 2024 ISP generally forecasts higher rooftop PV compared with the 2022 ISP. This gap starts relatively small (around 2023-2025) and significantly widens over time. According to the AEMO 2024 Draft ISP “Consumer Energy Sources are forecasted to be taken up even faster than before, with 18GW more rooftop solar by 2050 under Step Change compared to the 2022 ISP”. Increased EV uptake also significantly bumps daytime total demand, as consumers leverage increased rooftop solar to charge their cars. Figure 1 – 2024 ISP demand forecast compared to 2022 forecast by time of day in 2050 (Source: AEMO 2022 ISP and 2024 Draft ISP) Sharpe-Ratio-Optimised VRE Portfolio Sharpe Ratio and Portfolio Diversification Using 2022 ISP wind and solar half hourly traces from 2023/07/01 – 2052/06/30 (508464 datapoints) we generated a VRE portfolio that maximizes return (mean REZ capacity factor) relative to risk (standard deviation of REZ capacity factors). In other words, weights are distributed across the REZ’s in order to maximize the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio. While our optimiser doesn’t impose geographical distribution constraints, the Sharpe ratio inherently encourages diversification across REZ’s by forcing it to reduce portfolio volatility. For instance, when wind is subdued in Far North Queensland (Q1), it may be blowing a gale in Tasmania, but probably not in the North Qld Clean Energy Hub (Q2). Indeed, a 50% Q1 wind / 50% Q2 wind portfolio has a lower Sharpe ratio than 50% Q1 wind / 50% T1 wind (0.95 compared to 1.03), to provide a very simple example. For the same reason, the Sharpe ratio incentivises a mix of solar and wind – the wind still blows while the sun doesn’t shine – even though wind on average has a much higher average capacity factor than solar. Result Figure 2 shows how the Sharpe-ratio optimised portfolio is distributed across the states and between solar and wind. It is heavily weighted to Far North Queensland (REZ Q1), with 12.2% of the entire portfolio in Q1 wind and 5.4% in Q1 solar. Figure 7 illustrates how the weights are distributed across the REZ’s. Conceptually, the optimisation algorithm has sought out a high capacity-factor wind REZ and heavily weighted towards that, while still allocating the rest of its weight relatively evenly across the country. Also note that the Queensland REZ’s are spread over a wider range of latitudes than the REZ’s in other states. The portfolio sees Queensland as by far the biggest generator and has a wind to solar ratio that is line with industry lore, 77% wind, 23% solar (lore ~ 75, 25). It’s worth noting that during a quick VRE portfolio cost minimization exercise – algorithm was incentivised to minimize total capital cost of VRE portfolio – with the constraints (1) NEM OPSO demand is met and (2) a minimum Sharpe ratio was exceeded: Q1 was weighted even more heavily (> 30% of total portfolio). Again, this makes sense conceptually. As we reduce the incentive of the optimiser to increase the Sharpe ratio, its incentive to diversify the portfolio diminishes, leading to a greater emphasis on high-capacity-factor REZ’s. In this case, the algorithm cares more about maximizing capacity factors and minimizing cost / MW of generation than it does maximizing the stability of the system. Figure 2 – Tree map of Sharpe-Ratio Optimised Portfolio Distribution State Demand vs. Generation Queensland, SA, and Tasmania will be net exporters and Victoria and New South Wales net importers of energy based on our VRE portfolio and 2025 operational demand. The net importers happen to be the states with densest population, by a significant margin, see Figure 3. Logically, this net import/export status is partially explained by having less land available for high quality renewable energy generation per (energy-consuming)-capita in the densely populated states. Figure 3 – Net Energy Balance and Population Density by State 2025 (Source: AEMO 2022 ISP ) Figure 4 – Demand and Generation by State 2025 (Source: AEMO 2022 ISP ) It is also explained by the quality of renewable energy in each of the states. Vic and NSW’s REZ’s have the lowest mean capacity factors, highest CFs are in Tasmania and Queensland. Figure 5. Figure 5 – State average Renewable Energy Capacity Factors (Source: AEMO 2022 ISP ) Sub-Regional Demand Figure 6 shows how heavily NEM demand is weighted towards the NEM’s lower latitudes (Sydney-Newcastle-Wollongong and Victoria subregions alone make up > 50% of NEM demand in 2025). Figure 6 – 2025 OPSO Demand by NEM Subregion (Source: AEMO 2024 Draft ISP ) To contextualize the distance between our VRE portfolio generation and demand centres, Figure 7 illustrates demand by sub-region alongside VRE portfolio generation on an Australian map. The significant distance between the highest-generating REZ’s and the highest-demand sub-regions underscores the need to incorporate associated transmission costs in future iterations of portfolio optimisation. Given the considerable distance of the Far North Queensland REZ from major demand centers, transmission costs are likely to redirect a lot of this energy generation further South. Figure 7 – Sharpe-Optimized Portfolio Generation (Source: AEMO 2022 ISP ) and AEMO Sub-Regional Demand (Source: AEMO 2024 Draft ISP ) Method A system was then designed to meet the NEM operational (OPSO) demand for every half-hour period of the 2025 calendar year. ISP 2022 half hourly demand traces for CY 2025 were used, 17520 data points. We have assumed that energy flows freely from the REZ’s through to the demand centres as required and assumed no transmission losses. A transmission network will be modelled, and the cost of this transmission incorporated in future iterations of this analysis. We then firm renewable energy generation with storage capacity, pumped hydro, and open cycle gas, per the following dispatch order. Solar/wind energy is dispatched first. Where combined solar/wind generation exceeds NEM demand, the energy is used to charge up storage, or spilt when storage capacity is exceeded. For simplicity, we have assumed a round-trip efficiency of 100%. For any half-hour period where NEM demand cannot be met by solar/wind: In the months September through February, draw energy from storage if state of charge (SOC) greater than 80% capacity. Discharge as required until capacity < 10%. Figure 8 shows the impact of dispatching battery first in the summer months. Dispatch Hydro. We’ve assumed 7.5 GW and capacity of 14 TWh that can be drawn down at a cost of $5 / MWh. Dispatch open cycle gas. We increase modelled gas capacity to ensure that demand is met in every period. Dispatch storage, if not already dispatched in step 1, above. March through August we save storage until last in the dispatch order to firm hydro/gas in the case of renewable energy “droughts”. This ensures that battery capacity isn’t low when the NEM experiences long “negative runs” where demand exceeds VRE generation. Storage capacity is set to 4 hours at 15.4 GW [1] . Further optimisation of storage capacity is planned in future analysis work. Battery dispatch position Last First in Summer Gas Energy Supplied (TWh) 6.647 4.002 Storage Energy Supplied (TWh) 0.352 2.997 Time Storage spends full 86.2% 65.0% Gas Fuel Cost (millions p.a.) $ 665 $ 400 Figure 8 – Effect of Firming Dispatch Order on Storage Supply and Gas Fuel Costs Sensitivity Analysis After modelling the above system, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of varying the VRE portfolio capacity and the percentage of solar in the portfolio on both the capital cost and the combined (capital + fuel) costs over 5, 10, 15, and 30 years. Note, as this is a sensitivity analysis rather than a detailed costing exercise, 2025 fuel costs were simply extrapolated out over the specified time periods rather than adjusting annual fuel costs in line with demand. Future iterations of this work will model more accurate combined costs. We assumed the following prices when calculating the capital and long-term costs of our system. Item Price Unit Gas Capital $ 1,200,000 /MW Solar Capital $ 1,200,000 /MW Wind Capital $ 2,500,000 /MW Storage Capital $ 600,000 /MWh Gas $ 100 /MWh Storage Dispatch $ – /MWh Hydro Dispatch $ 5 /MWh Figure 9 – Assumed Capital and Consumption Costs VRE Portfolio Capacity NEM OPSO demand in the 2025 calendar year was 181 TWh. The VRE portfolio was scaled such that generation would meet a certain percentage of this demand (i.e., 100% indicates that the VRE portfolio generates 181 TWh during the 2025 calendar year). In the case of the Sharpe-ratio optimised portfolio, VRE capacity of 56 GW was required to generate 181 TWh (20.7 GW average) over the 2025 calendar year. Generally, as the VRE portfolio capacity increases, less firming capacity is required, reducing fuel costs but increasing capital costs (1GW of wind farms cost more than 1GW of gas plants). See Figure 10. However, the ratio appears optimised when VRE is set to generate around 100% – 110% of NEM OPSO demand, i.e., at a certain point the additional fuel costs become negligible compared to the increased capital cost of more VRE. See Figure 11. A contributor is hydro capacity. With lower VRE capacity, the hydro capacity (14TWh) is exhausted at some point during the reference year; the lower the VRE capacity, the earlier hydro runs out. At 100% VRE : NEM, hydro runs out on the 5 th of December, after we’ve ridden out the high-demand/low-solar of winter; gas and storage pick up the slack for the remainder of December. See Figure 16. At 110% VER : NEM we end the year with some hydro capacity remaining (3.4TWh). Further increasing the VRE portfolio beyond the 110% ratio essentially “wastes” the cheap hydro capacity in the eyes of the model/system. Figure 10 – VRE Portfolio Capacity: Sensitivity Analysis Figure 11 – 5-year Cost of Hydro and Fuel for Gas Gen (Billions) Wind to Solar Ratio The total output of each modelled portfolio was set to NEM OPSO demand + 10% for the wind-to-solar ratio sensitivity analysis. The system was modeled with 0%, 23.3%, 50%, 75%, and 100% solar. This was done by scaling the solar and wind portions of the Sharpe-ratio optimised portfolio accordingly. Notably, the Sharpe-Optimised portfolio (i.e., 23.3% solar) exhibited the lowest cost over any period greater than 5 years. The effects of increasing solar were: Slightly reduced capital. Capital reduction is tempered by the fact that solar has lower capacity factors, so the required portfolio capacity to meet demand increases with increasing solar % of portfolio. Increased reliance on hydro/gas/storage to supply power during significant shortfall overnight and decreased daylight hours in winter, and therefore: Significantly higher gas demand and long-term fuel costs. Figure 12 – Solar % of VRE Portfolio: Sensitivity Analysis Figure 13 – Open Cycle Gas Capacity Required with Increasing Solar % of VRE Portfolio Optimised System Based on the sensitivity analysis, a system with VRE portfolio scaled to meet 100% NEM OPSO demand over the 2025 calendar year was selected for further analysis. Due to Hydro running out in December in this scenario, the December dispatch order was varied, leaving storage until last (same as March-August). This ensured sufficient capacity for handling longer negative runs in December, minimizing the gas power requirements in those instances. Figure 14 summarizes the properties and performance of the optimised system over the 2025 calendar year. We have a 56 GW capacity VRE portfolio with a capital cost of $123 billion. The capital cost of firming capacity required to support this VRE portfolio is $46 billion (hydro excluded). As discussed in the sensitivity analysis, there were systems available with lower upfront cost, but once fuel costs were incorporated over 10+ years, this system was the cheapest. Figure 14 – Summary of Optimized System (Costs, Capacities, Energy Supplied) Figure 15 illustrates the energy supply for a 2025 average day, with firming capacity generally kicking in for the evening peak demand period and then (mostly hydro) continuing to supply overnight while solar is at zero. All pretty stock standard. Figure 16 and Figure 17 illustrate the supply seasonality. Hydro supply is highest March through August, when hydro is first (and storage last) in the firming dispatch order. Storage is highest in the months when it is at the front of the firming dispatch order. Figure 15 – “Optimised” System, Average Day Supply by Source – 2025 Figure 16 – “Optimised” System, Total Monthly Supply by Source – 2025 Figure 17 – “Optimised” System, Average Day Supply for Calendar Year 2025 by Quarter Key Assumptions / Limitations 2022 ISP demand, solar, and wind trace data is used. Future iterations of this work will update all underlying data to reflect changes in the 2024 Draft ISP. Transmission costs and losses need to be incorporated in a future iteration of this work. We understand that this will prove a pivotal piece in portfolio optimisation, particularly given the (potentially unrealistic) geographical distribution of our hypothetical VRE generation network in relation to the demand centers. Recommend further optimisation of firming capacity dispatch order, which is currently relatively static, aside from moving storage up the order during months of increased sunlight. Once a more realistic firming capacity dispatch order algorithm is in place, storage capacity needs to be further optimised. Storage round-trip efficiency needs to be incorporated.

    "title": "Convective downdrafts and high-voltage transmission lines",
    "date": "16-02-2024 11:51:00 AM",
    "content": "Several recent high-voltage transmission-line failures have highlighted a phenomenon that has a history in Australia going back well over thirty years. In the early 1990s two structural engineers: Henry Hawes at Powerlink (Queensland), and Dan Dempsey at Transgrid (NSW), began querying the then-current design approaches for wind loading, after observing and documenting numerous line failures in those states. They approached the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO, and later JDH Consulting and Weather Solutions, for advice – this led to studies in the late 1990s of line risk that covered every mainland state. These studies identified failures going back to the 1950s. The failures were primarily caused by small local windstorms that the industry then called ‘high-intensity winds’. These are now known as ‘convective storms’, or ‘convective downdrafts’ which include ‘downbursts’ and ‘microbursts’. These storms are often described in the media as ‘mini-tornados’ – however, although actual tornadoes can, and do, occur in Australia, the majority of transmission line failures are associated with the small local ‘straight-line’ winds from convective downdrafts. These extreme wind events are nearly always associated with thunderstorms. Every thunderstorm generates an outflow of wind in its life cycle, but very severe and damaging downdrafts of air are sometimes generated. Upwards convection of warm, moist air, is followed by rapid cooling at high altitude releasing latent heat, and heavy rain and hail. The negative buoyancy with respect to the surrounding air generates a strong downwards vertical motion. At ground level this often generates a horizontal vortex and strong winds for a short periods (typically a few minutes). It can be visualized as a single large gust that may envelope two or three transmission-line spans, including the supporting towers. Australia is not unique in experiencing these events. Downdrafts are known as ‘descendentes’ in Spanish. Similar storms with transmission line failures have been identified in Argentina, South Africa, Brazil, Canada and the United States. In the 1990s, several international meetings were held to share experience and develop new design approaches. In recent years, following the multiple failures in South Australia on 28 September 2016, extensive risk studies were undertaken for ElectraNet, led by JDH Consulting, in collaboration with the Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO (Land and Water), and University of Queensland, including analysis of all available recorded wind gust data from that state and separation and extraction of those from convective events. The main factors to be considered when designing for these events are: The orientation of a line with respect to the prevailing wind directions from convective storms The risk, or probability, of the ‘footprint’ of a downburst intersecting with some part of a line. The overall length of a line directly increases the risk of an intersection somewhere along the line. The lower turbulence gusting in the winds, compared with those in larger ‘synoptic-scale’ windstorms, which were the basis of traditional methods of transmission-line design. ‘Span reduction factors’, used to reduce the load on spans 400-500m long, can be 50% higher than those assumed in traditional design methods for wind loading. Thus a 140km/h gust speed in a small downburst may generate wind loads on a typical high-voltage span that are up to 50% higher than those in a larger wind event with the same gust wind speed at a point. As has been noted by others, most of the current high voltage network in south-eastern Australia is old, with some of dating back to the 1950s. The corrosion in some structures in Victoria has been reported on recently; however, this is not the sole reason for the failures in convective wind events – most of the network was designed and built before the phenomena described above were understood and even the towers in relatively good condition are under-designed for the wind loading from local convective storms. It would be horrendously expensive, and unrealistic, to upgrade every line in the network, so that failures from convective storms never occurred. However, new lines currently under construction, and in planning, for the energy transition, should be designed for these critical events, particularly the interconnectors between the legacy state systems. If not ‘gold plating’, some ‘silver-plating’ of the transmission system may be required if frequent power outages are not to become the norm.

    "title": "Early observations from examining the AEMO’s four-second SCADA data from Tuesday afternoon",
    "date": "16-02-2024 11:16:00 AM",
    "content": "As I haven’t seen anything posted elsewhere, here’s a view of some selected fields from AEMO’s four-second SCADA (causer pays) data set that sheds a bit more light on the sequence of events last Tuesday. Dundonnell windfarm tripped off rapidly and this was presumably driven by the initial fault as the 500kV lines near Anakie were flattened. System frequency then rose a little, possibly due to some customer loads around Melbourne tripping off in response to the voltage dip (my own airconditioning for one). Interestingly, the Loy Yang A units don’t seem to go offline immediately and instead appear to progressively run down over about a minute, with unit 2 charting a different course from its cousins (maybe a coincidence, but it’s a different turbine-generator make from the other three LYA units). All the usual caveats about this SCADA data not necessarily being completely accurate, and we certainly have to await AEMO’s reporting based on much fuller data to understand the underlying reasons for these events. This has also been published on Linkedin , where there other comments. ================================================================================================= About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

    "title": "The Generator Statistical Digest 2023 (GSD2023) is released",
    "date": "15-02-2024 02:01:00 PM",
    "content": "It’s Thursday 15th February 2024, and we* are pleased to release the GSD2023 … following a focused effort across both teams over the past ~8 weeks. * As with prior issues, it’s been a collaborative effort : (a) across a combined team (across Greenview Strategic Consulting and also some of us here at Global-Roam Pty Ltd ), (b) and with some highly valued assistance from others as well. (A) How we evolved to the GSD2023 The GSD2023 is an update on the issues that came beforehand (the GSD2022, GSD2021, GSD2020 and GSD2019 … all of which followed as an update to, and extension of, the statistical component that formed ‘Part 3’ of our very widely read Generator Report Card 2018 (GRC2018). The evolution is illustrated here: You can find more information about what came beforehand here on the focused section of the WattClarity site. (B) How you can access the GSD2023? The table below outlines how to order and access the GSD2023 (PDF) and the optional GSD2023 (Data Extract) . Order Access GSD2023 There are two options for you: Option 1) You can order the GSD2023 (PDF and hard copy), or Option 2) You can order the GSD2023 (PDF and hard copy) plus the Data Extract. Please nominate your selected option when you return this Order Form to us: Order Form GSD2023 After we receive your order, we will: Set you up with electronic access; Organise the delivery of your bound-hard copy; and Process your payment and provide a tax invoice. Clients who have already ordered can access the electronic PDF of the document at the link below. Download the GSD2023 (PDF) To use our downloads site, you’ll need to log in or register an account using your organisation’s email address. Please keep in mind that: the document is a large (~85Mb, for ~1200 pages) PDF so keep this in mind if on a low-speed link this process works in Chrome, Edge and Safari, but perhaps not other browsers. One bound hard-copy is also included in your purchase and we will begin to organise delivery soon after we have received your order. GSD2023 Data Extract Clients who have already ordered the optional data extract can access the files at the link below. Download the GSD2023 Data Extract Follow the steps above to log in to our site. You’ll then be able to access a zipped folder of the separate TSV files covering the majority of the data published in the GSD2023, plus an XLSX file we have included for those who want to use Excel. As per the order form, this data extract is for internal use within your organisation. We look forward to hearing back from you! (C) What’s the GSD2023 ( including what’s new )? Unlike the preceding issues (which were 2 x Volume publications of ~800 pages), the GSD2023 is a ~1200 page document that requires moving to a 3-volume format as follows: Volume 1 containing statistics new to the GSD2023 ~400 pages Volume 2 ‘A’ Page and ‘B’ Pages DUIDs until KPP_1 ~400 pages Volume 3 ‘A’ Page and ‘B’ Pages DUIDs from LADBROK1 ~400 pages In Volume 1 we have included familiar content, and also a considerable volume of new content to provide an even richer statistical record of operations in Australia’s National Electricity Market. 1) Familiar content includes: (a) The popular Glossary, which contains much more than published here . (b) The focused ‘FCAS Cost’ calculations, by FCAS Portfolio. … and more 2) New content includes both: (a) A focused review of the operation of Semi-Scheduled units through calendar 2023: (b) A 10-year review of every unit that participated in at least one FCAS market through 2023. Click through on the links above for more information about this new content. Moving from the GSD2022 to the GSD2023, the main set of data you’re used to seeing in the earlier issues is now located across Volume 2 and Volume 3. This data is historical performance statistics for units that were operational in the ENERGY market for some time of calendar 2023 – this includes: an ‘A’ Page containing a 10-year historical overview of key metrics, spanning 2014 to 2023 calendar years; a ‘B’ Page containing a 12-month detailed performance profile for the 2023 calendar year. This content is described further below . A useful reminder is that the GSD2023 (with a focus on calendar 2023) provides the second edition covering a full year of operations under Five Minute Settlement . Volume 2 and Volume 3 – for units operational in the ENERGY market Volumes 2 and Volumes 3 are for units operational in the ENERGY market through some part of 2023 – and hence are largely similar to the structure of the GSD2022, GSD2021, GSD2020 and GSD2019, which came beforehand. For all units that operated through some portion of the 2022 calendar year (i.e. for which AEMO published some non-zero InitialMW data) we have included two pages: A Page 10 Year Profile 2014 to 2023 B Page 12 Month Detailed Profile for the 2023 Calendar Year The A Page for each unit contains performance and financial metrics for the previous ten calendar years (i.e. 2014 to 2023). Metrics included on this page include monthly revenue, monthly availability and capacity factors, volume bid in price bands, unit starts, operating hours, etc. The image below shows the A Page for ER03 . There’s plenty on this page, spanning the most recent 10 years in the ENERGY market! The B Page for each unit contains more detailed performance and financial metrics for the previous calendar year only (i.e. 2023). Metrics included on this page include daily output, daily availability and capacity factors, monthly revenue, hours constrained, etc. The image below shows the B page for BRAEMAR1 . This is a detailed review of 2023. The advantage of this format is that it enables data to be reported on the same basis for all units! (D) What is the GSD2023 Data Extract? After we released the GSD2020, we received a number of requests from clients who wanted us to collate and release a separate extract of the data contained within the final document : 1) We completed the additional work to make the GSD2020 Data Extract available in March 2021 … 2) … so we did the same for the GSD2021 and GSD2022; 3) and now have done the same for the GSD2023 (complete with the much larger data set). The extract is available as an optional extra for those who wish to complete their own analysis of the data that we have calculated and processed. There is an option to order the data extract on the order form linked above. (E) Several Analysts present some initial insights, from the GSD2023 In conjunction with the launch of the GSD2023, we’ve asked several different analysts to independently delve into the detail of data published in the GSD2023 and share some of the things that jumped out to them in the following articles: From the team here at Global-Roam Pty Ltd Analyst (within Global-Roam Pty Ltd) Brief description of what they covered Linton Corbet Even prior to release, Linton was able to publish with respect to the GSD2023: 1) On 7th February 2024, Linton used the draft GSD2023 in writing ‘Engie announces early closure of two dispatchable South Australian power stations’ . 2) On 12th February 2024, Linton wrote about how the ‘GSD 2023 Uncovers Features in FCAS Enablement and Bidding’ … continuing Linton’s focus on the FCAS markets (particularly after the introduction of FFR. Now that the GSD2023 has been released, more articles will surely follow…. 1) On Wed 1st May 2024, Linton Corbet and Dan Lee gave a presentation for the CEC’s Market and Grid Directorate which drew heavily from the GSD2023 and GenInsights Quarterly Updates . 2) Following from this presentation, on 7th May Linton published the article ‘Regulation FCAS Costs in 2023’ , drawing from both. Paul McArdle Nothing prior to release, with respect to the GSD2023: … and we had to wait till 4 weeks after the GSD2023 had been released, to start to see some articles: 1 On Sunday 17th March 2024 , Paul wrote ‘How many Semi-Scheduled units have taken advantage of the market change that went live on 7th Aug 2023?’ ; and then 2) Next day (Mon 18th March), Paul wrote ‘How many Semi-Scheduled units were submitting Self-Forecasts through 2023 (and how many of these were actually used in dispatch)?’ . 3) On Tuesday 23rd April 2024, Paul gave a presentation to an organised by BofA Securities on the topic of Risk, Uncertainty and Volatility in the energy transition. This drew heavily from the GSD2023 and GenInsights Quarterly Updates . 4) One week later, Paul wrote about ‘Updated trend of ‘ENERGY’ bids in red, green and blue’ aggregating together the unit-level bid history provided in the GSD2023 to show a NEM-wide total. Dan Lee Even prior to release, Dan was able to publish with respect to the GSD2023: 1) Whilst the GSD2023 was still under development (on 11th January 2024), Dan referenced the earlier version in writing ‘The early wind farms reaching 20 years: how are they performing?’ (with 2 pages from the GSD2022 for Macarthur Wind Farm). 2) On 14th February 2024, Dan wrote about how the ‘AGL half-year results point to ‘strong financial performance’ for Torrens Island BESS (but not directly through the spot market)’ Now that the GSD2023 has been released, more articles have followed: 1) On 4th March 2024, Dan wrote ‘ A look into the performance of Genex’s four DUIDs in 2023, following takeover bid from J-Power ‘ 2) With respect to batteries : (a) On 6th March 2024, Dan published a longer review of battery performance ‘ State-of-charge: a peek into the economics and performances within the NEM’s battery fleet ‘ drawing heavily on the GSD2023; and then (b) Tangential to the GSD2023, on 15th March 2024, Dan wrote ‘Need for speed: How long has each battery project in the NEM taken to deliver?’ as a follow-on article. … both of these were very well received, and found their way onto other platforms as well. 3) On 7th March 2024, Dan wrote ‘ Keeping up with the curtailment : 3.7TWh of semi-scheduled economic and network curtailment estimated in 2023 ‘ 4) On Wed 1st May 2024, Linton Corbet and Dan Lee gave a presentation for the CEC’s Market and Grid Directorate which drew heavily from the GSD2023 and GenInsights Quarterly Updates . 5) Following from this presentation, on 2nd May Dan published the article ‘Keeping Up with the Curtailment Part 2: The what and the where’ , drawing from both. … there’s more to come above. From the team at Greenview Strategic Consulting Analyst (at Greenview Strategic Consulting) Brief description of what they covered Nick Bartels Nick Bartels is an Analyst at Greenview Strategic Consulting (co-author of this GSD2023). Even prior to release, Nick was able to publish with respect to the GSD2023: 1) On 14th February 2023 he posted his analysis piece ‘A look into minimum generation levels at various coal plants, using the GSD2023’ . Now that the GSD2023 has been released, more articles will surely follow…. When we publish these, we’ll try to remember to link them in here (and will also tag them as GSD2023 ).

    "title": "Weathering the Storm: Victoria’s Record-Breaking Energy Day",
    "date": "15-02-2024 01:40:00 PM",
    "content": "On Tuesday, 13 February 2024, Victoria’s energy sector experienced a day of profound contrasts. The day commenced with the setting of new records in renewable energy, a testament to the region’s ongoing shift towards sustainable power sources. Figure: Victorian Energy Source Contributions to Native Demand – Wed/Thu 13/14 Feb 2024 (GPE NEMLog-Lite) These achievements were, however, swiftly overshadowed by a dramatic turn of events when severe weather led to the collapse of six 500 kV towers on the Moorabool to Sydenham Line(s). This incident triggered the tripping of all four in-service units at the Loy Yang A Brown Coal Fired Power Station, marking a first in Victorian history where the system operated with only four coal units online, down from the previous low of five. Figure: Number of Victorian Coal Units In-Service – Weekly Maximum, Minimum and Mean from 01 Nov 2010 to 14 Feb 2023 (GPE NEMLog-Lite) The Victorian Wind Farms at Yaloak South, Bulgana, Crowlands, Dundonnell 1, Dundonnell 2, Dundonnell 3, Elaine / Lal Lal, Kiata, Moorabool and Murra Warra also reduced their output to zero following the tower failures, some already out of service most likely due to strong winds. Prior to these developments, renewable energy sources achieved significant milestones in Victoria, South Australia, and the NEM: Victorian Variable Renewable Energy (Vic VRE): At 11:35 hrs, a record high of 5,956.0 MW was achieved, which is an increase of 14.61 MW from the previous record of 5,941.3 MW set at 12:45 hrs on January 16, 2024. This represents a 0.25% increase. NEM Variable Renewable Energy (NEM VRE): At 12:00 hrs, NEM VRE reached a peak of 21,255.8 MW, up by 271.57 MW from the earlier record of 20,984.2 MW recorded at 12:50 hrs on December 6, 2023. This is a 1.29% increase. National Electricity Market Renewable Energy (NEM RE): NEM RE hit a maximum of 22,177.3 MW at 12:25 hrs. This was a significant increase of 494.0 MW from its previous high of 21,683.3 MW at 12:05 hrs on December 8, 2023, marking a 2.28% increase. Victorian Renewable Energy (Vic RE): The record for Vic RE was set at 6,310.9 MW at 12:25 hrs on February 13, 2024, up by 368.64 MW from the previous record of 5,942.3 MW at 12:45 hrs on January 16, 2024. This represents an increase of 6.20%. South Australian Rooftop Photovoltaic (SA Rooftop PV): On February 13, 2024, at 14:00 hrs, SA Rooftop PV reached 1,633.1 MW, surpassing the previous record of 1,607.4 MW set at 13:00 hrs on November 17, 2023, by 25.65 MW. This is an increase of 1.60%. As a result of the towers collapsing and the Loy Yang A Unit trip, new Victorian minimum Coal Output and Share records were set: Victorian Brown Coal Output (Vic Brown Coal): A record low output for Victorian Brown Coal was recorded at 1,237.0 MW at 15:40 hrs on February 13, 2024. This was a decrease of 366.99 MW from the previous figure of 1,604.0 MW at 10:55 hrs on December 16, 2023, translating to a 22.87% reduction. Victorian Coal Share (Vic Coal Share): Also at 15:40 hrs, the share of coal in Victoria’s energy mix dropped to an all-time low of 17.6%, down 12.21% from the previous record of 29.8% recorded at 11:45 hrs on December 21, 2023. This represents a 40.97% decrease. The events of the day, including the tower collapse and Loy Yang coal unit and other unit trips, highlight the critical need for a resilient and flexible energy grid. The lead graph depicting the Victorian Energy Supply for the day shows the impact of these incidents, particularly the tower collapse during the 13:10 hrs trading interval. Following the incident, gas played a crucial role in meeting Victoria’s energy demands, accompanied by necessary load shedding during certain periods. While one Loy Yang A unit briefly returned to service, it was later taken offline again, with only a second unit remaining in service. This day serves as a stark reminder of the challenges posed by low probability, high impact events like severe weather, which caused extensive damage to transmission and distribution infrastructure, affecting countless customers. The loss of a number of units and in particular the consequent shutdown of the Loy Yang A power station, a critical element of Victoria’s energy infrastructure, led to soaring energy prices and has already sparked intense debates about grid vulnerability and current energy policies. In witnessing Victoria operate with a record low number of coal units, we are observing a transformative era in energy production. This day underscores the evolving landscape of our energy systems and reinforces the importance of developing resilient and flexible grid solutions to adapt to these changing dynamics.

    "title": "A major blackout left 500,000 Victorian homes without power – but it shows our energy system is resilient",
    "date": "15-02-2024 11:26:00 AM",
    "content": "Half a million homes and businesses in Victoria were left without power late on Tuesday following a major power outage. The disruption occurred when severe winds knocked over several high-voltage electricity transmission towers, causing all four units of the Loy Yang A coal-fired power station to trip and go offline. Victorian Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio described the blackout as “one of the largest outage events in the state’s history”. The event has prompted questions about the reliability of the state’s electricity grid. But it’s important to note these extreme winds would have seriously disrupted any power system. It has little to do with the mix of renewable energy and conventional fossil fuels. As climate change worsens, we have much work ahead to ensure our electricity grids cope with severe weather events. But in this case, the fact that a complete system blackout was avoided is a testament to the resilience of the system. A day of wild weather An extreme storm, including strong winds and lightning, tore through Victoria on Tuesday afternoon. It caused two transmission lines near Geelong to collapse, prompting several generators to disconnect from the grid and cutting power to parts of the network. Other customers lost power after the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) ordered “load shedding”. This involves temporarily cutting off electricity supply to some customers to keep the network stable and prevent damage. According to a statement from AEMO , the storm also damaged hundreds of powerlines and power poles, and restoring electricity to all customers “may take days if not weeks” What happened at Loy Yang A? The disruption to electricity transmission caused AGL’s Loy Yang A generator to go offline. This was an automatic response known as a “fault ride-through” mechanism. It’s much like a fuse blowing if you have a short-circuit at home. When large electricity loads are rapidly and unexpectedly removed from the system, electricity supply and demand are no longer matched. It’s a dangerous situation and means electricity generators can be badly damaged or even destroyed if they don’t disconnect from the network. It appears that Loy Yang A was the first generator to disconnect. The effect was to reduce supply and help bring the system back into balance, preventing a system-wide outage. All generators have protection systems that stop them from being damaged in these kinds of events. Loy Yang A tripped up to protect itself from permanent damage and in doing so actually kept the system stable. It did what the system is designed to do. What part did renewables and coal play? When transmission lines fail, the whole system is affected. This includes all types of generators – wind, solar, gas, hydro, and coal. The power outages on Tuesday were unrelated to the proportion of renewables and fossil fuels in the energy mix. It’s possible that old coal power generators are more sensitive to transmission disruptions than newer technologies. But it’s far too early to say whether this had anything to do with Tuesday’s event. Battery storage may have helped steady the grid. Batteries have ultra-rapid responses to these kinds of disruptions and can add or subtract power from the grid within milliseconds to keep the grid stable. And looking ahead, one benefit of renewable energy systems is that they tend to be much more widely “distributed” geographically than coal generators. So when power lines go out, having a more distributed network actually provides more resilience. Lessons from South Australia In September 2016, wind storms in South Australia also blew over transmission lines. Cascading disconnections by generators meant the entire grid went black in a matter of seconds, causing a statewide outage . It will take months to analyse all the data from the Victorian blackout. But it may well show that the lessons learned from the SA blackout saved the Victorian grid. For example, AEMO was reportedly unaware about the exact settings of “fault ride-through” mechanisms on wind farms before the SA blackouts. This has since changed and may have helped minimise the impacts in Victoria. A warmer future We know more severe weather events are predicted under climate change. It will manifest in many different ways: strong wind events, heatwaves, bushfires, and floods. All infrastructure, but especially energy infrastructure, is vulnerable under these conditions. It means all of us – researchers, market operators, and generator operators – must work hard to make energy systems more resilient as we move into an uncertain future.

    "title": "[SLIGHTLY UPDATED] a sequence of events for what happened in Victoria through the day on Tuesday 13th February 2024 (via Timescale #1)",
    "date": "15-02-2024 10:47:00 AM",
    "content": "On Wednesday afternoon we posted ‘Some *initial* headline questions following the transmission damage, unit trips & loss of load, initiated on Tuesday 13th February 2024’ … including noting a desire to establish and understand a sequence of events in three different timescale : Timescale #1 = within the day, looking no smaller than a dispatch interval. Timescale #2 = focused on the minutes around 13:08 NEM time when we experienced the ‘Significant Power System Event’ . Timescale #3 = spanning days, weeks and months and looking bigger picture. In this article we’ll have a first pass at what happened through the day at a ‘Timescale #1’ level – and essentially just compiling a tabulated chronological list of events, some of which we noted on-the-fly as the day progressed on Tuesday . Big caveat … this is a first pass completed <36 hours after the event, late last night and posted this morning without checking – so beware there are likely to be errors! —– Notes – originally published at 10:47 Thursday 15th November and updated around 17:00 with further information. —– For our more learned readers, if you spot any – please let me know (directly) and/or let readers know in general (via a comment below). Dispatch Interval on Tue 13th Feb 2024 remembering this is ‘ NEM time ‘, and it is 5 minutes ending Development during this dispatch interval (readers should remember … with the images shown below, we try to set them up so clicking on the image will open in a new tab as a larger size image … so if you have 2 windows you can more easily read). up until 11:35 Nothing to add at this point. 11:40 Event #1 For completeness with respect to the day it’s worth noting that there’s this separate event that occurred earlier – with respect to the sudden and unexpected loss of generation out of Stockyard Hill Wind Farm in the 11:35 and 11:40 dispatch interval, as shown in this snapshot here of the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view : Note that this unit was then offline till late Tuesday night – so was not part of the production mix through Event #2 or Event #3 below. 11:45 to 11:55 Nothing to add at this point for these 3 x Dispatch Intervals. 12:05 At 12:03 the AEMO published Market Notice 114561 as follows: __________________________________________________ Notice ID : 114561 Notice Type ID : Subjects not covered in specific notices Notice Type Description : MARKET Issue Date : Tuesday, 13 February 2024 External Reference : Variation to FCAS regulation raise requirements: NEM Mainland – 13/02/2024 __________________________________________________ AEMO ELECTRICITY MARKET NOTICE Variation to FCAS regulation raise requirements: NEM Mainland – 13/02/2024 FCAS Raise regulation requirements have been increased.to manage frequency. The following constraint set has been invoked. F-MAIN_RREG_0450 at 1200 hrs. Manager NEM Real Time Operations We can see more detail about this ‘F-MAIN_RREG_0450’ constraint set in the ‘Constraint Set’ Details widget in ez2view, Time-Travelled at 12:05 on Tuesday 13th February: Importantly, the scheduled invocation of this Constraint Set (which had the effect of increasing the requirement for Raise Regulation FCAS was to last until the 13:55 dispatch interval. — PS … on Friday 16th Feb 2024 we posted ‘Aggregate enablement of RaiseReg FCAS from units in the mainland (excluding Basslink) on Tuesday 13th February 2024’ you could see for more details. 12:10 to 13:00 Nothing to add at this point for these 11 x Dispatch Intervals. 13:05 (Perhaps this could be a dispatch interval of focus in a later article with respect to Timescale #2 ) In this dispatch interval, which is before anything significant happened (at least as we know at this point) we’ll introduce three different screens from ez2view , all Time-Travelled back to 13:05 to show various aspects of the market at this point in time. Let’s start with this view of the ‘VIC Region Schematic’ widget, which has been upgraded for v9.9 in preparation for the IESS changes in June 2024 : In this snapshot we see that (coincidentally) the Jeeralang A1 unit has switched on, and that the P5 predispatch forecasts move up slightly compared to where they currently are. In the next snapshot, we include 3 different views of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget focused on various data points within Victoria: More often than not I’d choose the ‘grid’ option that enables the user to ‘ look up a vertical ’ to see ‘that other dimension of time’ … but in this case it makes more sense to show the ‘chart’ option … in which case the AEMO forecasts are out to the right. Third snapshot is the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget that’s filtered to just the VIC units ( upgraded for v9.9 to show consumption as negative megawatts) and looking backwards 3 hours and forward 3 hours: Note that the title bar colour here should be yellow, but I had many (many!) windows open to record this sequence and so the colours did not always work as intended. 13:10 Event #2 (Perhaps this could be a dispatch interval of focus in a later article with respect to Timescale #2 ) The AEMO noted in Market Notice 114577 that … At 1308 hrs 13/02/2024 a significant power system event occurred . Description of event – Multiple tripping of generation and transmission lines in the Vic region Transmission element(s) tripped – Moorabool Sydenham No1 and No2 500 kV lines tripped Region/s – Vic Load interrupted – in excess of 1000 MW Generation volume tripped – 2300 MW There’s much more that we’ll dig into via a follow-on article focused on Timescale #2 , however for now it is worth highlighting that (as Linton Corbet highlighted in ‘Grid frequency on 13th February 2024’ ) , the mainland frequency yo-yo-ed : 1) Fell below 49.9Hz; 2) Then rapidly rose as high as 50.12Hz; 3) and then rapidly fell as low as 49.689 Hz between 13:09:56 and 13:09:57 (which is outside the Normal Operating Frequency Band – so there will be threads to explore here). — From the perspective of Timeline #1 however, important to remember that the dispatch run for 13:10 was produced at 13:05 – so parameters like Price and Unit/Interconnector Targets were produced then … prior to the transmission collapse. As such there are only a couple notable things that emerge here: Remember that the unit outputs used in the 3 x widgets shown here are all based on ‘Final MW’ measurements when ez2view is in Time Travel … i.e. 1) They are not Targets; but instead 2) They are the SCADA snapshots taken at (or close to*) the end of the dispatch interval in focus I’ve highlighted here that there were two particular stations that showed large drops in output across their units: 1) Of the 4 x Loy Yang A units, it’s important to note that only 3 x Loy Yang A units are shown to have a substantial reduction in output: (a) in each case approximately 200MW lower (b) note that this is the dispatch interval before when all 4 units had tripped offline , which focused on the FinalMW for 13:15 (or the InitialMW for 13:20). (c) For reasons still to be determined specifically! (d) So the fact that (it appears) the drops in output across all four units were not synchronised is interesting, and worth further investigation. 2) Less talked about on WattClarity (though Allan did note here ), or elsewhere, was that all three Dundonnell units dropped to 0MW output … (a) We need to be clear that (at this point) the are still to be determined specifically! (b) Because it might have been because of transmission outage, or due to high wind cut-out, or for other factors. In the second window it’s no surprise to see no real change in the predispatch expectations: … and neither does it surprise that there’s no marked change in bids across Victoria (ENERGY supply shown here, but would not expect to see a change in relation to FCAS either, as the event had not yet happened): So let’s move on… 13:15 (Perhaps this could be a dispatch interval of focus in a later article with respect to Timescale #2 ) As highlighted in ‘Grid frequency on 13th February 2024’ , the mainland frequency was below 49.85Hz (and so outside the Normal Operating Frequency Band ) for this entire dispatch interval.. —- For this dispatch interval, in highlighting the linkages for ‘big change in unit output’ across the VIC region (remembering this is focused on FinalMW) we see a bit of spaghetti: Distilling it down, we see three key things have happened: 1) All 4 units at Loy Yang A have dropped offline : (a) Important to note that this is still actually for unknown reasons at this point… (b) Despite the fact that elsewhere it’s been written up as trips (including in other WattClarity articles) 2) The Murray hydro unit has significantly ramped up ; and 3) (remembering that Dundonnell is already offline) Numerous other renewable units have ramped down significantly : (a) Again with reasons unknown at this point; (b) Because there might be several causes, and we have not actually unfolded them! — As noted in ‘Grid Inertia in the Victorian Region drops with the coincident tripping of 4 x Loy Yang A units’ , the Grid Inertia had dropped significantly in the VIC region at this point. — Here’s the ‘ Forecast Convergence ’ widget window: … which shows a modest change in AEMO’s expectations. Here’s the bids view for the 13:15 dispatch interval: To understand the comment added on the image, let’s consider the 13:15 dispatch interval: 1) Keep in mind that the ‘Gate Closure’ for bids is shortly before the start of the dispatch interval (let’s say 13:09:30 in this instance). 2) With the transmission disruption occurring at 13:08 and not telegraphed by NEMDE until Market Notice publication at 13:22:13 … that means few participants would have realised something was happening. 3) Perhaps either or both AGL (at Loy Yang A) or Tilt Renewables (for Dundonnell) might have had a head start in knowing – but even if they did, it would leave only ~1 minute to react (make sense of the situation, determine how to rebid, gain approval for that, and submit the rebid). 13:20 (Perhaps this could be a dispatch interval of focus in a later article with respect to Timescale #2 ) As highlighted in ‘Grid frequency on 13th February 2024’ , it was not until ~13:19 that the mainland frequency increased up back past 49.85Hz and so into the Normal Operating Frequency Band. —- At a more macro perspective, we see … In this snapshot I’d like to initially highlight three developments: 1) On the NSW side of the Snowy Region, there’s a large ramp up at the TUMUT plant. … perhaps a timely reminder to review what Allan wrote with respect to ‘What’s happening around Wagga?’ as an illustration of how the complexities of the network sometimes are not 100% aligned with regional boundaries. 2) All four interconnectors into Victoria have increased Target Flow into Victoria. 3) The VIC dispatch price has spiked to the Market Price Cap (a) but interestingly the P5 predispatch price forecasts have not spiked (b) nor do they spike in the dispatch intervals below, as one might expect (c) for reasons still to be explored (though there is a hypothesis below). In terms of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget focused window … Here is the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget window … As highlighted here, there’s a sharp difference in the aggregate volume offered for 13:20 compared to the (much higher volume) still offered for 13:25. Why is this. Hypothesising (i.e. it’s a guess – don’t hold me to it): 1) Is this something related to Loy Yang A; or 2) Collectively, is it something related to the crude form of auto-bidder currently used in the market? Something to investigate further… 13:25 (Perhaps this could be a dispatch interval of focus in a later article with respect to Timescale #2 ) Five minutes forward, and this is what we see… Some of the gas-fired peakers are starting to ramp up. The spot price is still at the Market Price Cap … but P5 Predispatch is still low! In terms of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget focused window … Here is the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget window … As noted here, there’s an even larger mismatch between the bids used in dispatch for the VIC region for 13:25 and the (apparently thousands of megawatts larger) volume of bids taken into account in the P5 predispatch run: 1) A quick check in this dispatch interval (by filtering further, not shown here): (a) I’ve confirmed that the Loy Yang A capacity is reduced to 0MW in the 13:25 dispatch interval for the first time … but still remains in the P5 predispatch run; whilst (b) Scanning quickly to Wind and Large Solar assets, appears that there is also a large mismatch between the 13:25 dispatch interval and P5 for the 13:30 dispatch interval. 2) No wonder the P5 predispatch prices look subdued (and keeping in mind other factors, as well). As a (somewhat) useful reference, it was at ~13:24 that i published the first article ‘4 Loy Yang A units simultaneously trip, on Tuesday 13th February 2024’ … but: 1) that was after taking perhaps 10 minutes to react, write and publish 2) and I’m not a trader … and WattClarity is not our revenue earner. Let’s keep this in mind as we flip through. 13:30 With respect to the 13:30 dispatch interval, keep in mind that this is the first dispatch interval prior to which could possibly have read Market Notice 114577 about ‘Significant Power System Event’ that was published at 13:22:13 . Prior to that time, there may have been a large amount of guesswork going on … Here’s the first window at 13:30: There are no doubt other things that could be highlighted here, but I’ve highlighted the 4 x interconnectors and how in this dispatch interval we’re seeing some weird and wacky export and import limits of the type written about here (in response to customer question – GR Case 00006624) . Again – the spot price is still at the Market Price Cap … but P5 Predispatch is still low (but we’re starting to understand why)! In terms of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget focused window … Here is the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget window … There’s still a mismatch shown here in volume offered at 13:30 compared to (P5 predispatch for) 13:35. 13:35 Here’s the ‘actual’ data for the 13:35 dispatch interval: In terms of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget focused window … Here is the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget window … We see the mismatch here is lower than it was shown to be in the dispatch interval above. One reason for this is that the Loy Yang A capacity has been removed (i.e. marked to 0MW) in the P5 and P30 predispatch time horizon. Have not checked the Semi-Scheduled units. However the P5 predispatch forecasts are still subdued … with the spot price is still at the Market Price Cap . Needs further investigation… 13:40 Here’s the first window: More weird and wacky interconnector limits (re GR Case 00006624) . In terms of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget focused window … The spot price is still at the Market Price Cap … but P5 Predispatch is still low! Here is the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget window … Nothing to add at this point. 13:45 Here’s the first window: In terms of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget focused window … The spot price is still at the Market Price Cap … but P5 Predispatch is still low! Here is the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget window … Nothing to add, at this point. 13:50 Here’s the first window: In this case I have highlighted an up-down-up pattern with prices – the spot price is still at the Market Price Cap , the P5 Predispatch is still low, but the P30 predispatch forecast is high! In terms of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget focused window … Here is the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget window … Nothing further to add. 13:55 Here’s the first window: I’ve highlighted in this snapshot the Market Notice relating to forecast LOR2 later in the day. Did not note it at the time, but it was MN114589 published at 13:52 as noted here: ‘________________________________________________ Notice ID : 114589 Notice Type ID : LRC/LOR1/LOR2/LOR3 Notice Type Description : MARKET Issue Date : Tuesday, 13 February 2024 External Reference : PDPASA – Forecast Lack Of Reserve Level 2 (LOR2) in the VIC Region on 13/02/2024 __________________________________________________ AEMO ELECTRICITY MARKET NOTICE AEMO declares a Forecast LOR2 condition under clause 4.8.4(b) of the National Electricity Rules for the VIC region for the following Period: [1.] From 1430 hrs 13/02/2024 to 1600 hrs 13/02/2024 . The forecast capacity reserve requirement is 562 MW. The minimum capacity reserve available is 384 MW. AEMO is seeking a market response. AEMO has not yet estimated the latest time at which it would need to intervene through an AEMO intervention event. Manager NEM Real Time Operations’ In terms of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget focused window … Here is the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget window … Nothing further to add. 14:00 We’ll leave the from ez2view snapshots at this point, and only add in commentary or images when we feel they are useful (based on the limited review performed to date). 14:05 Nothing to add at this point. 14:10 Nothing to add at this point. 14:15 Yesterday with a NEMwatch snapshot for the 14:15 dispatch interval I wrote that ‘Supply to lost load appears restored in Victoria … but Loy Yang A will take longer’ . At this dispatch interval, the ‘Market Demand’ is sitting at 7,778MW … which turns out to be the highest point in the day . Because shortly afterwards … 14:20 … at 14:18 the AEMO announced its intention to commence RERT Negotiations . This was noted (and copied into) in the article ‘AEMO to commence RERT negotiations in VIC’ here. As noted earlier Wednesday in ‘Some *initial* headline questions following the transmission damage, unit trips & loss of load, initiated on Tuesday 13th February 2024’ , I did not see anything further about either RERT being contracted, or RERT being dispatched. — But in MN114607 (which they published later at 14:35:06) the AEMO noted that a Load Shedding Direction in the VIC Region had been given to, to commence at 14:20 … as copied into the article ‘Load Shedding Direction in the Vic Region’ article. 14:25 Nothing to add, at this point. 14:30 At 14:27 the AEMO notified of an ‘Actual LOR3 ’ in the VIC region . This was recorded yesterday in the ‘Chronology of (300MW) load shedding in Victoria on Tuesday 13th February 2024’ article. —————- Keep in mind that (as noted in MN114589 published at 13:52 and noted above), it was the 14:30 dispatch interval in which the forecast LOR2 was forecast to commence! There’s an obvious question here, about ‘what changed?’ . 14:40 At 14:35:06 the AEMO notified (in MN114607) of Load Shedding Direction in the VIC Region . … which we then copied into the article ‘Load Shedding Direction in the Vic Region’ article. 14:45 Nothing to add at this point. 14:50 Nothing to add at this point. 14:55 Nothing to add at this point. 15:00 Nothing to add at this point. 15:05 Nothing to add at this point. 15:10 At 15:06 the AEMO published MN114625 as an update on ‘Significant power system event – Victoria region – 13/02/2024’ as follows: ‘__________________________________________________ Notice ID : 114625 Notice Type ID : Emergency events/conditions Notice Type Description : MARKET Issue Date : Tuesday, 13 February 2024 External Reference : Significant power system event – Victoria region – 13/02/2024 __________________________________________________ AEMO ELECTRICITY MARKET NOTICE.

    "title": "Some *initial* headline questions following the transmission damage, unit trips & loss of load, initiated on Tuesday 13th February 2024",
    "date": "14-02-2024 04:22:00 PM",
    "content": "What happened yesterday (Tuesday 13th February 2024) has a number of parallels with what unfolded over the period 30th and 31st January 2020 , and then for months into the future from that point. Within 48 hours of that event I’d posted ‘13 headline questions and observations following the long-term islanding, starting Friday 31st January 2020’ . So, with less time elapsed to get my thinking straight, I’ve had a stab at an initial list of questions (that we’ll try to find answers for – time permitting) with respect to 13th February 2024 … not enough time for any real observations yet (with apologies to the journalists and so on who are calling to ask): (A) What could have been expected (and prepared for) in advance? It’s logical (and important) for the industry to ask the question ‘what could have been expected (and prepared for) in advance?’ . Given the current stresses* of the current challenges of returning supply to those still without power, and initiating the process for repairing the destroyed transmission towers, we’re probably not going to get the best answers* in asking these questions right this minute . * these stresses, and chances of reaching useful conclusions, are not helped by the growing band of people ( especially at the extremes of the Emotion-o-meter ) looking for someone (or their least favoured technologies) to ‘blame’! As Andrew Richards noted earlier today. But for now just wanted to flag that this is a question for the future… A1) About the possibility of severe weather At 10:56 on Tuesday 13th February 2024, Ashleigh Lange posted ‘Dangerous mix of weather in VIC, NSW, TAS’ … so only a couple hours before the storms toppled the transmission lines. There may well have been earlier warnings in the days beforehand. A2) Weather and the electricity market The AEMO had previously issued ‘NEM Local Temperature Alerts’ for VIC in relation to temperatures in Mildura some days beforehand: 1) Market Notice 114521 at 10:44 on Monday 12th February; and 2) Market Notice 114700 at 11:12 on Tuesday 13th February 2024. These types of notices are about helping generators located in the area (e.g. around Mildura) to ensure they update AEMO with the generally reduced plant capability due to the higher reference temperatures. — However (unless I am missing something – which is quite possible) I could not find any Notice from AEMO about ‘Severe Weather’ prior to (and related to) what happened on Tuesday 13th February – as shown in this snapshot search in ez2view today: Looking back 400 days in the search there are a fair number of notices … just none related to Tuesday 13th February 2024. My recollection (which again, might be wrong) is that (after the SA System Black ) the AEMO ramped up its processes for using forecasts of Severe Weather to reclassify contingencies or otherwise downgrade network transfer capacity to provide more headroom for if calamity should strike. I wonder what pre-emptive steps might have been taken to provide more safety margin in advance of Tuesday 13th February 2024 … and whether it would have been possible to forsee an increased risk of transmission towers on the ground in that particular location ? A3) Market Participant preparations? A different thread for consideration is the extent to which market participants were able to prepare in advance for calamity. For instance, those with very limited energy capability … were they fully charged and ready to go (noting that this is of particular interest in the future as we accelerate towards a more ‘just in time’ approach to managing stored energy on the ground ). (B) What was the sequence of events? There’s a few different timeframes that come to mind, under this heading – which we could sum up in three buckets: Timescale #1) Within the day Focusing just on the day (Tue 13th Feb) , what was the sequence of events (e.g. as storms rolled through to topple the transmission towers and cause widespread) which led to the tripping of demand and also the tripping of supply (including Loy Yang A – but also some renewable generation). In this timescale we’d be interested in: (a) what the weather did … i. In terms of driving Underlying Demand ; ii. Then when the storms rolled in to cool the demand, and (unfortunately) knock over transmission towers and cause major damage at the distribution level. (b) what AEMO and the NSPs did in response to the system stresses through this period … for instance, AEMO notified the market of RERT Negotiations (i.e. separate to the 300MW directed Load Shedding and the earlier automatic Loss of Load), but I did not see any update about either: i. Something (i.e. RERT) being contracted; and/or ii. Something being dispatched. (c) what the behaviour, and responses from Market Participants … i. Such as who bid what in response, and the speed and duration for which various assets were deployed; ii. Not so much from a ‘who saved the day’ perspective (frequent readers will recall I find that mindset irritating!), but from a perspective of who reacted on what timescale, what the motivations might be (remembering it’s impossible to know someone’s motive ), and what the outcomes were. … for instance, Pedro asked us here ‘I would be interested to see your insights into the performance of the large battery generation systems in Victoria for yesterdays event.’ . 1. We’d also be interested … not just in relation to technical capability and performance, but also in terms of what was offered into the market (and how any SIPS-like scheme contributed). 2. But not just about batteries! … and I’m not just meaning at a wholesale level … 1. Amber Electric’s proudly promoting it’s impact of spot price pass-through (and a bit of automation) to retail customers: 2. Over at Tesla, Josef Tadich is also proudly promoting the effect of the Tesla VPP process: … also noting that this update was picked up on RenewEconomy in ‘Grid drama and power cuts as multiple coal units and lines trip in midst of heatwave’ . 3. Closer to home, we wonder about what happened onsite at many of the large industrial energy users who are our clients across Victoria (having some form of spot exposure and/or participation in FCAS markets) Update: On Thursday morning 15th February 2024 we posted a first pass through what we could see that happened on Tuesday 13th February 2024 in the article ‘A sequence of events for what happened in Victoria through the day on Tuesday 13th February 2024 (via Timeline #1)’ , and will look to drive our understanding further in the coming days…. There are plenty of other questions that arose in the course of this investigation! Timescale #2) Seconds and Minutes Zooming in, to just focus on the minutes before and after 13:08 … when the transmission element failure at 13:08 NEM time on Tuesday the 13:15 dispatch interval – to consider such things as: (a) A microscopic sequence of events (e.g. did the loss of load occur before the Loy Yang A trip, as speculated here yesterday ); and (b) The impact on system frequency and so on. plus much more. As another ‘for instance’, Glenne Drover’s tagged me on a particular rabbit hole (oops, question) about whether this was the biggest trip in the history of the NEM: Resisting the temptation to slip further into that rabbit hole, it’s worth highlighting that ‘biggest trip’ might be broadened to mean ‘biggest disruption’ and so encompass various threads, including: i. Largest number of MW offline in a single instant in time ii. Largest drop in system frequency; iii. Most customers (or highest number of MW) offline as a result; iv. Largest $$ cost to consumers … and so on… Timescale #3) Days, Weeks and Months Zooming out to look at the days, weeks and months ahead in: (a) the repair process for returning damaged transmission lines to service … remembering that the DNSP challenges are not really our focus; and (b) the investigations into what happened, the lessons learnt, and the implementation of the recommendations. … which we’ll collate under this Headline Category on WattClarity ) (C) Questions, and implications, about transmission system failure? Yesterday evening Dan Lee posted some thoughts here on LinkedIn that related to the article ‘How common are islandings and transmission tower failures in the NEM?’ he wrote on 16th December 2022. Both the post on LinkedIn and the article from late 2022 generated discussion. Today Dan has posted ‘Another tower collapse poses more questions about transmission’ : Dan’s noted some of the questions we have – below I will try to categorise them: C1) Higher (than expected) Failure Rates? From an ‘outside looking in’ perspective, we’ve wondered if it’s actually the case that we’re seeing more frequent transmission failure in the NEM (in more recent years)? There’s essentially two different questions in one here: (a) Are we experiencing higher failure rates now? (b) Are these higher failure rates unexpected … and, if so, why? If time permits, this is something we’d like to explore in more detail … though it may be that there are others out there better placed (with the right data) to help us answer this? On this question, interesting to note Dr John Holmes’ comment on one of yesterday’s article here , where he says: ‘JDH Consulting are wind loading specialists and have been studying failure of high voltage transmission line towers in Australia, particularly in Victoria for about 25 years. Failures due to small but intense storms such as microbursts are common for a number of reasons, such the wind structure within the storms and the directional orientation of the line. The risk of failure along a line is also dependent upon its length. JDH has been in discussion with AusNet regarding a specific study of line risk for the Victorian network, similar to the extensive studies carried out for ElectraNet in South Australia, following the many failures that occurred there in September 2016.’ … and noting the other comments as well. C2) Weather impacts? Dan’s note above speaks of ‘severe convective winds’, and links through to more information from the ESCI Project . With climate change a key variable in (and driver of) this energy transition , what does this mean for the future? C3) Technical and organisational considerations? It’s worth flagging here that there are also technical and organisational considerations. Dan’s note above speaks of ageing assets, but it’s also worth noting … (a) that it’s worth asking if there are other considerations (e.g. changing design standards, or changing operating and maintenance practices) that (b) Seems at this point (with us on the outside looking in) that these are unlikely to be factors … but it would seem useful to ask. C4) Implications for the energy transition? It’s worth noting that there have been those on social media who have used this as an opportunity to propose undergrounding transmission (a very expensive exercise?) and/or utilising more DC connection. These questions will be asked. There’s also questions related to the energy transition … such as: (a) What does it mean in the light of the ‘ we need to build 10,000km of transmission’ as part of the first stages of the ISP ? i. How does it change the cost-benefit of the whole plan, compared to a more localised approach (before being misread – I am NOT specifically advocating a more localised approach here)? ii. What does it mean in terms of particular transmission paths or network configurations … would some represent higher risk (remembering Risk is a function of Probability and Consequence )? (b) What does it mean in terms of the approach taken for modelling (i.e. by AEMO in the ESOO and the ISP … but also in terms of the rigor in market models run by consultants for various project proponents in their business models)? i. What assumptions are made for MTTR and MTBF for transmission elements … and hence what is assumed in terms of specific Outage-related Constraint Sets in the market models? ii. For instance, we noted last year that the 2023 ESOO only includes ‘System Normal’ (i.e. it does not consider the HILP effect of events such as this). So buyer beware! iii. Reminds me that we flagged this specific challenge when covering ‘What’s next for market modelling’ as Key Observation #6 within GenInsights21 a few years ago now! … specifically we wrote (in 6.5) ‘Modelling System Normal is not enough’ . (D) Plus many more… Other questions keep popping into our collective heads, but no time to record them all here…",

As the glossary for each of the ‘B’ Pages for each DUID shows, we include a chart at the top of each page that has the daily minimum and maximum MW generated for the day, as well as the available capacity and the new information, what was its PASA Availability which is especially helpful for understanding whether it was recallable, hence off for commercial reasons (see the commentary below on Gladstone units). What we can see in GSD 2023 Having read through the AGL half-yearly presentation last week (which Dan also mentioned today ), we were interested to see the comments related to reductions in minimum generation at Bayswater, so we analysed those units first to see what it showed. From the above chart of BW02 from the GSD 2023, we can see that in January the lowest the load got to was 330 MW, but then from February the unit began loading down to 200 MW. From July loading down to 200 MW became more frequent. And whilst there is a clear trend for 2023, it is only when we look back to GSD 2022, for the same unit, that we can see the clear differences, as shown below. In GSD 2022, we can observe the unit rarely going below 330MW. When it does go down to around 200 MW it appears it is for testing purposes, otherwise the minimum load on BW02 in 2022 was ~330 MW. Given the continuing demand reductions in the middle of the day, this additional 130MW of flexibility on BW02 which has been used since February 2023 would be extremely useful. What are other units doing? We can see the same patterns repeated on units BW03 and BW04. In 2022 minimum load on these units was rarely below 330 MW, but from 2023 minimum load down to 200 MW was a near daily occurrence. It seems BW01 had not yet made regular use of lower minimum loads like the other units, but we expect it won’t be far away. Achieving lower minimum loads on Units BW02, BW03, and BW04 last year was timely because prices from July to December in NSW (as shown by the monthly RRP for NSW) were considerably lower than the first six months of the year. For completeness, the VWA is the volume-weighted average RRP for each unit (the below table shows BW04), as well as Connection Point Dispatch (CPD) price or the effective nodal price. You can see the lower generation when all four Bayswater units will reduce the required generation by up to 520MW in the middle of the day, a significant benefit to the AGL portfolio and also the system. So what are other portfolios doing? This time, using the TSV Data Extract of all the GSD2023 (and prior editions), we were able to develop up a few extra charts to see the trends over time for the coal fleet, using the minoutput field in the tables to see a history over time. Given we have data back to 2019, we have included all the years here. We used the minoutput field, divided by the maxcapacity to give a percentage value to allow us to normalise the results across regions and stations. By removing a few of the daily outliers for unit start ups, shutdowns and maintenance issue, each dot in the below charts represents the daily minimum generation (expressed as a percentage to max capacity) for the last 5 years for the VIC brown coal fleet. It shows that since 2021 Alinta’s Loy Yang B began to regularly operate down to around 40% of capacity (approx. 250MW output). In this chart it is also interesting to see the distinctive operating levels of the Yallourn units at approx. 50, 60 and 70% capacity. When we look at the actual charts for Yallourn, we again see a trend for lower operating levels in the second half of the year to make way for higher wind and solar generation (and hence lower average monthly RRP which barely made it above $30 for the months Sep – Dec). What about trends in other regions? The decreasing output trend on Bayswater is clear to see, dropping from around 40% of capacity in 2019 to 25% in 2023. A similar trend occurred at Mount Piper (MP1 and MP2) in 2022. Eraring has been capable of minimum loads down to 30% in recent years but at the end of last year showed signs of even lower minimum loads with 25% loading achieved in December 2023, which is a good result for a station that was already flexible. The preferred and consistent operating levels of the unit are also clear to see in the below NSW chart. When it comes to QLD, despite 5 years of data, there appears to yet be significant changes in minimum operating level. Having said that, and as noted above, these operating range charts also allow us to see the PASA availability (the indicator to AEMO that the unit can be recalled from an outage). Each of the green arrows indicates a period where a unit is offline, but still PASA Available (can potentially be returned in 24 hours), hence its outage could be considered commercial in nature, rather than technical. We do wonder whether lots of people analysing key generator information have failed to make the distinction! A similarly interesting pattern can be observed at the remaining three Torrens B power station units in SA, where at least one unit was PASA Available for all but a few days of the year, despite actual generation being the lowest in the last 10 years for each unit (The ‘A’ page data for Torrens B shows the 2023 annual generation compared to previous years – a great handy reference for all generators). When the output range charts are collated for the Torrens B units, a few clear observations can be made: There are many days where Torrens B units are fully PASA Available, fully Available to the market, but not generating above 40-60MW for many days in a row. Similarly, the min generation level of 40MW is clearly visible (this represents 20% of max capacity which is a very good level for a steam generator – Torrens B is a gas boiler, steam generator) Conclusion The GSD 2023 is a fantastic resource to really understand what is happening in the NEM. Whilst lots of comments and opinions occur, this resource allows fact-from-fiction to be understood and the real metrics of the generation fleet to be analysed in pictorial form, and when combined with the TSV data file for specific analysis by unit, the power of these statistics are clear for all to see.

    "title": "Another tower collapse poses more questions about transmission",
    "date": "14-02-2024 02:58:00 PM",
    "content": "Photographs of the downed towers near Geelong have appeared across the mainstream media this morning – following yesterday’s significant power system event in Victoria that resulted in power losses for hundreds of thousands of customers across the state . It’s now clear that six towers in total collapsed due to strong wind speeds – the images below have been supplied to us by one WattClarity reader. In December 2022 I wrote the piece How common are islandings and transmission tower failures in the NEM? here on WattClarity, where I attempted to compile a reference list of every single event that resulted in a transmission tower failure or collapse in the history of the NEM (up until that point). As I noted on LinkedIn yesterday afternoon , this appears to be the 6th occurrence of a tower failure in the NEM since 2020 – whereas I could only find 9 such instances of this happening in the 20 years prior. The resulting discussion suggests that at least two factors may be involved with this apparent trend: 1) the increasing frequency of severe convective winds, and 2) the aging state of transmission structures. Severe Convective Winds Some online users have suggested to me that severe convective winds (or downdrafts) have been increasing in frequency in Australia in recent years – and are projected to increase over time. The ESCI (a project funded by the Federal Government, CSIRO, AEMO, and AusNet Services) published this very useful fact sheet in July 2021 that explains the threat of severe convective winds to the NEM’s transmission infrastructure – with a specific focus on Victoria’s network. Location of tower failure events between 1959 and 2020 in Victoria compared to environmental conditions conducive for Severe Convective Winds. Note that AusNet Services have attributed the four tower collapses on the Bendigo to Kerang 220 kV line (-36.5 , 144) to tower design inadequacy. Source: Electricity Sector Climate Information Project, July 2021 It is also worth noting a recently published academic paper on long-term observations of severe convective winds across Australia from a team of researchers at the University of Melbourne and the Bureau of Meteorology. An aging transmission network As I noted in my prior article , much of Victoria’s transmission network consists of structures originally designed between the 1960s and 1980s – with the average structure age assumed to be well past 50 years in 2024. Age brackets of the AusNet Services transmission structures (as of July 2020). The expected service life for structures is approximately 70 years. Source: AusNet Services, July 2020 The full July 2020 report showed that Victoria’s 500kV structures are slightly younger than those within the rest of the network. And the vast majority of the 500kV structures exhibited conditions classed as ‘Good’ – which is described as ‘first rust spots appear’ on either bolt & nut, steel member, brace, or poles within the structure. The aforementioned ESCI report from July 2021 concluded “Maintenance and upgrades consider several factors, including exposure, history of failure and physical condition of the tower, but generally towers are not systematically upgraded to today’s engineering standards.” Questions to think through The extent to which both wind conditions and network age (i.e. structural adequacy) were factors in the tower collapse is still up in the air. I will leave that to be debated amongst the atmospheric physicists and the civil engineers. But yesterday’s events and the possible growing trend of tower failures have posed more questions from others in our team, such as: What does this mean in terms of planning with respect to VNI-West? How should these High Impact-Low Probability events be captured in the RIT-T process? How does this impact AEMO’s long-term modeling? Specifically, assumptions regarding network reliability. How many existing transmission towers in the NEM should be reassessed/redeveloped for improved resilience to severe convective winds? And to what extent are consumers ready and willing to pay for this improved resilience? Many others..",

    "title": "AGL half-year results point to ‘strong financial performance’ for Torrens Island BESS (but not directly through the spot market)",
    "date": "14-02-2024 11:40:00 AM",
    "content": "Last Thursday, the 8th of February 2024, AGL published their half-year results for the 2023/24 FY. The announcement includes news of a $399m interim profit for these six months , and a tripling of their interim dividend to 26c/share. The company’s share price jumped 10.3% on open last Thursday. That same day, RenewEconomy interviewed AGL CEO Damian Nicks , and reported on the company’s success in battery project investment, specifically highlighting the strong revenues of their newly constructed 250MW Torrens Island BESS. Digging a bit deeper, I have extracted the image below from AGL’s accompanying results presentation, which states that EBITDA for the project was $7m “for 3 months in 1H24”. The sources of revenue for this battery are broken down into three categories: FCAS, Arbitrage, and Capacity – with the latter making up the vast majority of revenue generated from the project. AGL’s Half-Year Results Presentation highlighted a ‘strong financial performance’ from the Torrens Island BESS – but with only a relatively small proportion of the revenue directly through the NEM’s Energy or FCAS markets. Source: AGL FY24 Half-Year Results Presentation Using our soon-to-be-released GSD2023 to retrieve market revenue data, I can fill in some of the blanks here: Torrens Island BESS FCAS Revenue July to December 2023 = $1.21m Torrens Island BESS Spot Energy Revenue (i.e. ‘Arbitrage Revenue’) July to December 2023 = $2.39m I have calculated those numbers by combining the figures for each of the generation and load DUIDs for the Torrens Island BESS, as published in our GSD. The somewhat-obscure graph within AGL’s presentation suggests that somewhere around 80% of the battery’s revenue was not directly through the transparent spot market, i.e. revenue generated by being dispatched for energy or FCAS. The specific source of this ‘Capacity’ revenue is a mystery … but one we are very curious about, as: 1) From our initial investigations, I can’t find any data that suggests that the battery is part of the System Integrity Protection Scheme (SIPS) in South Australia; 2) The wording ‘AGL derives additional capacity and portfolio benefits’ in the presentation suggests that the added value is more holistic; 3) So perhaps one of our more learned readers can clarify, or point me to any announcements in the public domain, to help me understand the nature of this ‘Capacity’ Revenue, and what specifically is getting accounted for here? In any case, I will note that the battery spent the majority of 2023 in commissioning – which would have an impact on its opportunity to generate FCAS and Energy revenue, and maybe, Capacity revenue, depending on the nature of this revenue source.

Source: GSD2023 Note that this is an extract for the ‘B’ Page of the TIBG1 DUID (p1153 or 1194 in the GSD2023), which is the supply-side unit (at least until two-becomes-one with the IESS implementation in June 2024). There’s a similar or the ‘B’ Page of the TIBL1 DUID (i.e. the consumption-side unit) that’s not shown here.",

    "content": "Tuesday was a dangerous and damaging day of weather in Victoria as powerful winds, severe thunderstorms, catastrophic fire danger and mass power outages impacted the state. The burst of ferocious summer weather was caused by a strong cold front and pre-frontal trough passing over the state, which caused a cold air mass from the Southern Ocean to clash with a much warmer air mass sitting over Australia’s southeast. Image: A squall line around 1,500 km in length causes lightning across parts of four states on Tuesday afternoon. This volatile weather pattern caused powerful winds and severe thunderstorms, which produced: A wind gust of 130 km/h at Mount Gellibrand shortly before midday, which is equivalent to a category two tropical cyclone Wind gusts of 126 km/h at Yarram Airport, 122 km/h at Avalon Airport, 119 km/h at Eildon Fire Tower, 117 km/h at Swan Hill, 115 km/h at Fawkner Beacon and102 km/h at Melbourne Airport 543,762 lightning strikes within a 600 km radius of Melbourne between 9am and 9pm AEDT on Tuesday Dry lightning that ignited new fires amid Extreme to Catastrophic fire danger ratings A massive squall line, which resulted in thunderstorms stretching roughly 1,500 km across parts of Vic, NSW, SA and Tas Large hailstones falling from fast-moving severe storms Tuesday’s powerful winds caused six transmission towers to collapse near Anakie, to the north of Geelong, resulting in power outages to more than 500,000 customers. According to Victorian Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio, this has been one of the largest outage events in the state’s history. Some of the lightning caused by Tuesday’s thunderstorms occurred with little to no rainfall, allowing these cloud-to-ground lightning strikes to ignite new fires. This was likely to be the ignition source for some of the fires that started and got out of control in the state’s west on Tuesday. Image: Images captured by the Himawari-9 satellite showing smoke from two large fires in western Victoria on Tuesday afternoon. As of 10pm AEDT on Tuesday, emergency warnings were still in place for several bushfires in western Vic, while a severe storm warning was also in place for the squall line passing over southern NSW and the ACT.

The last time this happened was on 31 January 2020 when a storm destroyed a section of the 500kV transmission line linking Victoria and South Australia – so I wondered if there’d been some sort of power system event. Indeed. Based on AEMO’s market notice, the triggering event may have been a trip of two parallel lines linking Moorabool near Geelong with Sydenham in the west of Melbourne. These are a major section of the 500kV transmission ring around the greater Melbourne area, so it’s not surprising a trip of those lines would have significant impacts. The Bureau’s radar indicates there may well have been a storm and lightning in the vicinity of these lines at the time: But given their distance from the Latrobe Valley, it seems very surprising that this event appears to have caused the near-simultaneous trip of all four Loy Yang A units: You might expect an event like this to crash system frequency. As confirmation, I’ve stolen a helpfully provided high-res frequency trace from (of all places) Facebook : The apparent nadir at 49.65 Hz isn’t low enough to trigger under-frequency load shedding, but other factors associated with the event may well have “shaken off” some of the lost load “in excess of 1,000 MW” referred to in AEMO’s market notice. My aircon for one. In response to that loss of generation, we see hydro and fast-start gas generators ramping up after the LYA trip. Also note a few windfarms in the area of the tripped lines seem to gone offline as well: Big flows south out of New South Wales on top of the Victorian hydro and Snowy’s Murray stations. In fact it looks like flows at this particular time are exceeding secure limits, based on the number of violating constraints about an hour post-event: The spot price remains at the Market Price Cap of $16,600/MWh, and AEMO has begun Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT) negotiations as I post – more to come on this event undoubtedly … but that’s all for now. ================================================================================================= About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

    "title": "GSD 2023 Uncovers Features in FCAS Enablement and Bidding",
    "date": "12-02-2024 03:30:00 PM",
    "content": "The February 2024 release of the GSD (Generator Statistical Digest) expands to display, for the first time, bids and enablement levels of units participating in the 10 Frequency Control Ancillary Service (FCAS) markets in the NEM. Readers will find the FCAS Registered Units – 10 Year History in Volume 1 of GSD 2023 . There is a page for each registered and participating unit: The header includes high-level details on the unit, including location and registered max capacities. GSD2023 uses 13 price bands to aggregate bids. These 13 bands support a consistent grouping across energy and FCAS bid analysis, although the bands below 0 $/MWh don’t get used by FCAS bids. Bids are represented as the monthly-aggregate volume, in bars. Overlaid on the FCAS Registered Units History charts is the monthly aggregate level of enablement ( a black line ), and a label for each year provides a handy total of enablement for the year. And at the bottom of each unit-specific page is the total spot market revenue for each year. It allows the reader to link the FCAS enablement volumes to an overall dollar value. There is a lot of information to process, as a reader. And each reader, having their own interests and perspectives, may well take a choose-your-own-adventure approach to reading the publication. In this article I’ve started to inspect the 10-year FCAS history section. Three units of differing technology and makeup stood out: Thermal Generator in QLD Here’s a portion of the bottom part of the FCAS History for Darling Downs Power Station in QLD. The annotated image stands out initially for the lack of bids and enablements since mid-2022 in the lower contingency services pictured. A similar feature can be seen in the raise services that the unit is registered for. We also note the colour of the bid bars – mostly green – indicating bids > 0 $/MWh and < 300 $/MWh. The lighter the green the lower the price range. Battery in VIC Batteries continue to make a significant contribution to FCAS markets. Gannawarra, in VIC, started out in 2019 providing regulating services and then expanded into contingency services in 2021. In 2023 (and 2022 since June) it appears to have adjusted its bidding to offer volumes at more diverse prices ranges. Ancillary Service Provider Unit in QLD Enel X’s ancillary services unit in QLD ‘ASQENC1’ represents an aggregation of sites capable of providing FCAS. This represents one of the many new types of units that participate in FCAS markets without participating in central dispatch of the the Energy market. This example shows the Queensland unit began in 2018. After some early months offering capacity at 0 $/MWh the unit’s capacity was consistently offered in the 0-35 $/MWh range. And until 2022 almost all availability appears to have been enabled. 2021 doesn’t look particularly atypical, based on the charted bids and enabled volumes, yet the spot revenue was very strong relative to the adjacent years. A changing of the guard is emerging Analysts who order the optional extra – the csv data extract – will have the table and chart data from the 3 Volumes of GSD2023 in a convenient digital form. I’ve used the csv data extract to present the following summary of FCAS volumes enabled, using the GSD’s 10 year history. This means adding up the black lines on from the charts above, grouping by market and a custom resource category label. I’ve used two custom resource categories to distinguish: Traditional: Traditional FCAS resources such as thermal generators, hydro generators and pumps, aluminum loads, and New: New types of FCAS resources such as batteries, Virtual Power Plants (VPPs), aggregations, demand response units. This category starts in late 2018, when the Hornsdale Power Reserve (a big battery in SA) commenced operation. A chart of the result, below, uncovers how New FCAS resources are becoming the predominant source of enabled FCAS in almost all markets. Data Source: GSD2023 Data Extract Total levels of FCAs enabled haven’t changed much since 2020. A clear decline in enabled volumes from Traditional resources is evident. The gap is being filled by enabled volumes from New resources. The greatest gains have been seen in Raise Contingency services, and also in the Lower 5min service. Are enabled volumes, relative to availability, increasing? Inspired by a tweet on X, remarking how the enablement of the new 1-second Raise service has risen relative to available levels, I’ve used the GSD2023 data extract again to look at this statistic, but go back further, and span across all FCAS markets. The tweet captured a chart from AEMO’s Quarterly Energy Dynamics report (for Q4 2023) and touched on how the relative percentage enabled of 1Sec Raise had risen over the quarter to remarkable level (almost 50%): “Is the % enabled of 6Sec Raise FCAS much lower than the December level for 1Sec Raise?” To answer, we can inspect the chart below and draw out the following: The 1 Sec Raise percentage in December 2023 was 45%. The 6Sec Raise percentage in December 2023 was 34% of available. A month earlier, it was 42%, in November 2023. We might conclude this is a bit lower, but not substantially? – Subjective, of course! 6Sec Raise has typically been enabled at the highest % relative to availability, out of all all FCAS markets. Typically, from 2022 and 2023 months, the Raise 6Sec enablement has generally been between 35% and 45% of available. Prior years have seen enabled levels (monthly-aggregate) nudge 70%, relative to availability. These extreme levels occurred in 2018 and 2020. Now, we know enablement requirements are currently capped for both 1Sec markets. Coincidentally the cap level for 1Sec Lower was due to move from 100 to 120 MW on Monday 12 February, 2023 (market notice 114358). The 1Sec Raise cap was not due to change from it’s present level of 225 MW on that same Monday. The capped requirement levels are in place to ensure there is adequate availability to meet the required levels in dispatch. And in Very fast FCAS markets continue to grow, December 2023, we saw how the 1Sec Raise continues to be regularly enabled at the capped level. So, for 1Sec Raise, we may anticipate that the percentage enabled will stay steady until either: Increased availability comes into the market driving the percentage lower, or The requirement cap is increased allowing more to be enabled, driving the percentage higher, or Perhaps most likely, some combination of both cap and availability increase.",

    "title": "Batteries, coal revenues and demand response units: Insights from the GSD2023",
    "date": "12-02-2024 01:26:00 PM",
    "content": "Editor’s note: Each year we invite energy analyst, David Leitch, to review our annual Generator Statistical Digest, and share his top insights on WattClarity. It was no different again this year as here David shares his key takeaways from reading his pre-print copy of the publication. The GSD2023 is scheduled to be released later this week – you can order your copy using this form . A definitive reference Global-Roam and Greenview Strategic Consulting have released the 2023 edition of the Generator Statistical Digest . Each year the digest grows running close to 1200 pages for the 2023 edition and undoubtedly the premier reference in the industry. In this analyst’s opinion, the GSD is worthy of a website in itself, notwithstanding that the vast quantity of data that has been summarized, analysed, and coherently presented is by nature static and wont change until the next edition. Each edition produces new sections and this edition provides more organization and emphasis on FCAS. Nevertheless, there is performance data on every AEMO DUID. As an analyst my own focus generally is on having reliable data that can be massaged, even tortured, into the form required to provide insight into some analytical question. The skill, if there is any, lies partly in knowing what questions need to be asked always bearing in mind the epigram adorning the front page of Copeland and Weston’s “Corporate Finance” namely that the questions remain the same but the answers change. Its no secret that the NEM is changing rapidly, and many questions are asked about that change. Looking at the GSD it’s already very obvious that the number of DUIDs is expanding very rapidly. At a guess, there are about 427 DUIDs covered in the GSD. In my estimation in about another 5-6 years, there will be little focus on the remaining coal generators and much more on the performance of the more diversified generator set that is being built to replace the coal generation. As I mentioned last year, you cannot hope to understand the NEM in all its beauty without a good appreciation of behind-the-meter solar and increasingly behind-the-meter storage. Behind the meter is the classic case of the power of numbers and is of course, considered as a whole, likely by far the most predictable and reliable source of generation in the NEM. How much more comforting it is to know that we depend on millions of small units rather than a few large units. If only solar ran for more than say 8 hours a day. Equally although its important to understand FCAS revenue, its just as important or more so in the next few years to understand LRET revenue as this can be an important driver of generator behaviour. Batteries are becoming significant. Over the past couple of years one technology, initially the butt of jokes, has come to be taken very seriously and captured a big share of the incremental investment dollars. And that’s batteries, or for engineers, never satisfied unless there is an acronym, its BESS. Its become clear that the role of batteries, evident to me for close to a decade, is moving from the fringes to the mainstream. In the case of the NEM, we can think of the fringe as FCAS or ancillary services, to firming wind and solar, [VRE]. Even on the fringes its now I think, accepted by the industry that batteries are the ideal technology for frequency control, capable of virtual inertia as well as very fast frequency control. Cost reductions driven by learning rates seen in the use of batteries in EVs are now seeing developers start to choose batteries over pumped hydro projects even in the 8-10 hour duration task. Development times are so much faster, and environmental and more broadly social license issues are so much easier even if the useful life is much shorter. Battery revenue by source The GSD is indexed by alphabetic DUID. Unfortunately there is no “fuel type” index. I was interested to find out where batteries get their revenue from and how this is changing. The GSD does a great job of presenting this information. For instance if I look up the battery that got the ball rolling in Australia, that is the Hornsdale Power Reserve [HPR]: On pages 682 and 683 I can see details of HPRL1 (the load component), with the revenue chart from p682 shown below; Not shown here is (on p680 and 681) the details for HPRG1 (the generation component) … so noting there is also a revenue chart for that, which contains more red, orange and yellow (for FCAS Raise services ). Figure 1: Hornsdale Power Reserve, monthly revenue by segment. Source: GSD2023 From this, I can see that HPR’s (load side) revenue: is lumpy; and on the load side, much of that revenue is derived from lowering frequency. Being a load, it’s also understandable that it had negative ‘Energy’ Revenue … i.e. because it is purchasing at spot to fill. Using the excellent Global-Roam NEMreview v6 product which does allow selection by fuel I was able to identify the 16 utility batteries that were in operation at one time or another in the NEM in the past year. I used these with the GSD to produce an analysis of batteries by revenue source for all of 2023. Figure 2 NEM batteries revenue 2023. Source: GSD2023 Readers should note that battery analysts are really interested in the “spread” revenue rather than just “sales” as the battery energy has to be bought as well as sold. Still based solely on the chart it seems that the sale of “energy” is a big share of category revenue. Looking at only the FCAS revenue it’s interesting to see that although “raise contingency” is the main sector driver a couple of batteries had lower contingency as the main source. Figure 3 NEM battery FCAS revenue 2023. Source: GSD2023 In terms of forecasts I expect both energy and FCAS revenues to grow over time. As the coal generators close batteries will provide all the frequency control in an inverter based grid. To the best of my knowledge based on discussions with the technical people this is not something to be feared but rather embraced. Batteries can be widely distributed in the grid providing resilience at many points to frequency shocks. Coal units dominate the top revenue DUIDs Figure 4 Top revenue earning units in the NEM 2023. Source: GSD2023 Demand response achieves the highest volume-weighted prices but… Demand Response volumes are tiny as yet and I don’t focus on them. For both producers and consumers what really matters is average day peak prices. For instance, the following figure shows the average time of day price over the past year for selected states. Figure 5 Major state average time of day prices, last 12 months. Source: NEM Review It’s clear that the average time-weighted price is impacted by peak prices. For instance, for NSW last year keeping the average maximum half-hourly price to $130/MWh (above the fuel cost of gas) drops NSW prices by over $10/MWh. Figure 6 NSW actual prices and impact of lowering only evening peak prices. Source: NEM Review, ITK Batteries are already choosing to price above gas in some instances, but as more batteries are built there will essentially be more competition to be dispatched and peak prices will come under pressure. Or at least that is my expectation. Figure 7 Highest average price earners in NEM. Source: GSD2023 Finally at this glance through the GSD what about the lowest price receivers? Certainly there were, as you would expect, some solar farms near the bottom of the list. Kiama Solar Farm 1 average price was $12/MWh, GLENSF1 (Glen Rowan) did worse averaging -9.71/MWh. Essentially it was generating to earn RECs, not really a happy place should its PPA expire and conditions not have changed. However it was interesting to see, given that AGL received just $22/MWh for Macarthur wind farm, one of the largest in the NEM. About our Guest Author David Leitch is Principal at ITK Services .

    "title": "The matter of Callide C back in Federal Court (this time via AER)",
    "date": "09-02-2024 04:48:00 PM",
    "content": "Less than 2 weeks has passed since ‘Federal Court rules about Callide C – independent investigation authorised’ , and the underlying troubles that manifest in the explosion at Callide C4 on 25th May 2021 , and has continued since that time is back in Federal Court … but this time at the behest of the Australian Energy Regulator. One of our team members found this afternoon’s article from the ABC : In addition to the article above, following a quick scan I see the following pieces of additional information: (A) Key points of background Repeated from preceding article for ease of readability … There’s probably five points that sum up the situation, at a very high level: Headline 1) The Callide C4 unit has been offline since 25th May 2021 following a major explosion in the turbine hall : … In other articles I have wondered if this would be the ‘longest outage in the history of the NEM’, but have not had time to definitively check Headline 2) The root cause of the explosion is still not publicly known . (a) Many months ago Dr Sean Brady was commissioned by CS Energy (50% owner of the Callide C station) to conduct an investigation and report back (b) But this report has not been publicly released – and, as far as I have seen, there’s been nothing formally announced as to the status of the report Headline 3) The sister unit, Callide C3, has been offline since 31st October 2022 when the cooling tower structure (which also supports Callide C4) collapsed . This has since been rebuilt. Headline 4) The coincident calamity affecting both units forced the other 50% owner (IG Power Callide (IGPC)) into voluntary administration on 24th March 2023 . Headline 5) The partial shareholder in IGPC, Sev.en Global Investments (7GI) initiated the Federal Court action in December 2023, as noted by Nick Evans at the time (and hence via WattClarity 30th Dec 2023 ). (B) Information from the Federal Court At the Federal Court, the relevant reference Number appears to be QUD61/2024 … but (understandably) there’s not much information there, as it’s only just started: (C) Anything from key stakeholders? As I hit ‘publish’ on this article (17:00 on Fri 9th Feb 2024) the following is what I have seen from various stakeholders. (C1) At the AER On the AER website under the news section, there is the ‘AER takes court action against Callide Power Trading for alleged breaches of National Electricity Rules’ news release: … which links through to ‘Callide Power Trading Pty Ltd: alleged breaches of the National Electricity Rules’ : (C2) At Callide Power Trading The Callide C station is owned in a 50:50 joint venture between two parties: (C2a) CS Energy I did not see anything under ‘News’ on the CS Energy website (though it is early days, obviously). (C2b) IG Power Callide (IGPC) As noted above, this entity has been under voluntary administration since 24th March 2023 (i.e. approaching 2 years after the explosion). This entity has various stakeholders involved, including: 1. Sev.en Global Investments 7GI is a partial owner of IGPC (and was the one who initiated the other case in the Federal Court ). I also did not see anything under ‘Press Releases’ or ‘News Highlights’ on the 7GI website. 2. Chinese investors Other partial owners of IGPC are power sector investors from China (including CHNG). (D) Information elsewhere In terms of other media outlets… (D1) At AFR Nothing yet at the AFR? (D2) At the Australian A quick scan finds the article ‘Australian Energy Regulator hauls Callide Power Trading to court over May 2021 incident’ by Valerina Changarathil: (D3) At RenewEconomy I also found the article ‘Coal generator to face court over blackouts caused by “catastrophic” explosion’ by Michael Mazengarb: (D4) Elsewhere? I have not yet seen anything else… (E) Latest information on return-to-service expectations On 15th January 2024 we wrote about how ‘Hot & Wet Weather pushes back expected return to service dates for Callide C3 and Callide C4’ . Checking again in the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view (at 16:40 on Friday 9th Feb 2024), we see that there’s been no further change , since then, of expected return to service: With respect to the image: As follows: (E1) Callide C3 This unit has been offline since 31st October 2022 (cooling tower), and the expectations for Unit 3 are as follows: (a) On 29 Feb 2024 (back to 200 MW) (b) On 31 March 2024 (back to 466 MW) (E2) Callide C4 This unit has been offline since 25th May 2021 (explosion), and the expectations for Unit 3 are as follows: (a) On 30 June 2024 (up to 210 MW) (b) On 31 July 2024 (back to 420 MW)",

    "title": "Engie announces early closure of two dispatchable South Australian power stations",
    "date": "07-02-2024 12:11:00 PM",
    "content": "It was this article in the AFR, on the 6 th , which drew our attention back to generator closures. Australian Financial Review article The AFR article helps us understand Engie’s reasoning for the closures. The plants, which are designed to run only on peak demand days, are unprofitable. The imminent release of GSD 2023 captures revenues at Port Lincoln and Snuggery, and more… In the third of three volumes in this year’s expanded edition, GSD 2023 , we find Port Lincoln Power Station’s two generating units POR01 and POR03. The Snuggery Power Station is also within, registered with unit identifier SNUG1. We can see, in the spot market revenue chart of GSD2023 for Snuggery: Revenue has always been from the energy market, it’s not registered in any FCAS markets. Monthly revenue is typically greatest in summer months (January and February). And low or near-zero in most other months. Winter 2016 and 2022 being the main exceptions. The greatest revenue month was January 2019 where revenue reached above $2M. The most consistent revenue year was 2022 (from May, the ‘energy crisis’) where May to September saw reasonable revenues, relative to prior years. There was some, shall we say, ‘out-of-season’ revenue in 2023 also. Snuggery Revenue, GSD 2023 In the spot revenue chart of imminent GSD 2023 for Port Lincoln’s two units, we see a similar pattern to that of Snuggery: Higher revenue in summer months, with January 2019 being the stand-out. Generally consistent revenue over the energy crisis months in 2022. Not captured here, but the next chart on the GSD page shows bid volumes. Readers will be able to see how the unit has almost always been offered at the high end of the price range (> 10,000 $/MWh), though we can spot rare occasions where some volumes have been offered near the market price floor (-1000 $/MWh). Unit POR01’s revenue saw some gains in January and February in 2023. As such 2014 and 2015 appear to be years with slightly lower revenues than 2023 on the chart. Port Lincoln Unit 1 Revenue, GSD 2023 Energy market spot revenue across 2023 for Unit POR03 was the lowest it has been since 2014. Port Lincoln Unit 3 Revenue, GSD 2023 Reductions in Scheduled Supply-Side Units The closures bring forward a reduction in dispatchable generation capacity that is relevant for peak demand periods. In GenInsights we’ve been monitoring the changes in dispatchable generation capacity using market data and AEMO’s list of future closures on the Generation Information page. Back in May 2023 we posted this article about how we might not be keeping up with replacing dispatchable capacity, at the rate and magnitude of recent and upcoming closures. The announcement for Snuggery and Port Lincoln missed the cutoff for AEMO’s January 2024 release of its Generation Information spreadsheet, which holds the old date as 31 Dec 2030. Yet we have been able to accommodate it in the next chart, a pre-release (draft) version for the upcoming GenInsights Quarterly Insights for Q4 2023 . Pre-release view of changes in scheduled supply-side capacity from GenInsights Quarterly Insights for Q4 2023 Looking past 2025 The next withdrawal of dispatchable generation appears to be AGL’s Torrens Island B. With 3/4 units totaling 600 MW (note that unit 1 was mothballed in 2022, but not appearing on the above chart as has not ‘technically’ closed) this will make a dent in total dispatchable capacity when it closes. The current closure date is 30 June 2026. Increased interconnection in the form of Project Energy Connect Supporting the flow of energy between states, Project Energy Connect is underway as a two-phased project. This is the new electricity transmission project connecting the southwest of NSW to SA. It will provide approximately 800 MW of transmission capacity between New South Wales and South Australia power networks*. Phase 1 will deliver 150 MW of bi-directional capacity, estimated to be operating from mid-2024 with transmission between Robertstown in SA and Buronga in NSW. Phase 2 will increase the transfer capacity from and to SA (which is measured in conjunction with the existing Heywood interconnector in the south-east of SA) once the transmission line works are complete (including extending from Buronga to Wagga Wagga)*. *PS1 After Phase 2 of PEC is completed, the combined transfer limit across Heywood and PEC interconnectors is expected to be 1,300 MW import into South Australia and 1350 MW export. This represents the existing capacity of Heywood (650MW) operating in conjunction with the new 800 MW capacity of PEC.",

    "title": "Brief details of low % VRE on Thu 19th Oct 2023 (Case Study Part 1)",
    "date": "06-02-2024 12:53:00 PM",
    "content": "Last Saturday (4th February 2024) I was able to belatedly make a start on some analysis for the GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q4 release. There are several analysts across both organisations* who are involved with different aspects of the compilation of each Quarterly Update … … remember (*) that these ‘WattClarity Deeper Insights’ publications (including GenInsights Quarterly Updates , but also the soon-to-be-released GSD2023 ) are compiled by a combined team across two organisations : (a) There’s a team of us here at Global-Roam Pty Ltd , (b) But there’s also the team of people at Greenview Strategic Consulting (led by Jonathon Dyson ). For me personally, I have a list of different pieces of analysis that I complete each quarter – and we’re actively seeking to expand the our analysis each quarter. Two focal points for me have been as follows: 1) I’ve already posted two snippets about IRPM results through 2023 Q4: (a) There was ‘Sky-high IRPM in the middle of the day, Sunday 1st October 2023’ and (b) There was also ‘Brief details of IRPM through the day on Monday 20th November 2023’ ; … both of which we might delve into later in subsequent Case Studies … 2) In this article I’m posting about one snippet about % VRE. … might have time to talk about other focal points later. (A) Background to % VRE The specific focus on percentage VRE was added into the Quarterly Updates series with the release for 2023 Q3 (i.e. the one just before that). From that release I’d previously published ‘Case Study (part 1) of low % VRE NEM-wide on 3rd and 4th July 2023’ . That prior article is useful to highlight here, because it explains : 1) Why we believe it’s more important for us to focus on ‘percentage VRE’ and not ‘percentage Renewables’ ; and 2) Why we believe it’s more important for us to understand the low points , rather than (for us to join many others to) celebrate the high points. (B) The week 15th Oct 2023 to Sat 21st Oct 2023 In the following chart we’ve extracted a subset of the data compiled for the GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q4 report: In this article I particularly wanted to flag the low point (at 2.9% percent VRE ) seen for three consecutive dispatch intervals on Thursday evening 19th October 2023 . 1) But I thought it would be useful to show the whole week for context 2) There’s a very noticeable spike in VRE through daylight hours: (a) supercharged by the ‘gangbusters rooftop PV’ that we’ve talked about recently; (b) but also supported by production from Large Solar i. to the extent that > it’s not commercially curtailed due to negative prices; or > it’s not technically curtailed due to network limitations ii. a useful time to highlight that clients will be able to quickly ascertain both ( and understand the difference), for individual solar farm DUIDs, through the new add-in focused on Semi-Scheduled units to the GSD2023 . 4) But in particular through this period the total VRE production drops to only ~700MW for a period around 19:00 in the evening of Thursday 19th October 2023. At this time total supply was ~24,500MW: (a) so ~23,800MW required to come from various forms of firming supply. (b) which harks back to concerns raised before that ‘ We’re not building enough replacement firming capacity ’ . I’m not going to explore the events of Thursday 19th October 2023 in more detail at this point – but more posting this here today in order that one of us might follow on later (if time permits) to explore in more detail.",

Price Volatility Firstly, a quick record of some volatility that evening captured in SMS alerts (triggered via ez2view – though NEMwatch and deSide can also facilitate this) … though not as extreme as earlier forecasts that even made the mainstream media: NSW demand results In terms of ‘ Market Demand ’ in NSW, the high point reached yesterday ( 12,245MW at the 16:40 dispatch interval – NEM time ) was considerably lower than the earlier forecasts – such as those mentioned above. Not the highest so far this summer At this level, it was certainly not the highest point for NSW demand this summer. 1) Contrary to earlier predictions, it was lower than the level of ‘ Market Demand ’ seen in NSW on Sunday 4th February, when NEM-wide demand was the highest it’s been thus far in summer 2023-24 (i.e. 12,295MW at 17:40). 2) Scanning back through time, I see Sunday 21st January 2024 also saw higher demand in NSW (the NEMwatch image here was from 18:10 with NSW at 12,495MW , which was the highest point on the day) . 3) Indeed, back on Thursday 14th December 2023 at 17:55 the same measure of demand reached 13,053MW : (a) a day captured in a few articles collated here . (b) this was the highest point this far for summer 2023-24 in NSW. Lower than earlier P30 predispatch forecasts Adding in this collage of 3 x ‘Forecast Convergence’ widgets in an ez2view window time-travelled to 20:00 ( NEM time ) shows ow the earlier P30 predispatch forecasts turned out to be higher than what actually unfolded.

In this case the most recent forecast runs have grown a little cooler, with demand turning out a little below prior expectations 3) In contrast underneath is Available Generation, which we see is growing a little more red during the evening period (i.e. successive forecasts being for lower Available Generation). 4) The intersection of these two (somewhat opposing) trends would mean considerable uncertainty about price expectations for the same period this evening – but the AEMO’s most recent P30 predispatch forecasts are for prices to be lower than earlier thought.

    "title": "What is the point of the RRO?",
    "date": "05-02-2024 02:12:00 PM",
    "content": "The Retailer Reliability Obligation (RRO) is a complex administrative accounting framework overseen by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) which places major compliance burdens primarily on retailers, but also generators, large customers and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). Its objective is to force all load to be contracted, supposedly providing the consistent cashflow to enough supply to provide reliability. When proposed, it was felt it would finally provide confidence to those stakeholders who don’t believe energy-only markets are reliable. Mandatory contracts between supply and demand might conceptually parallel a conventional, centrally-contracted capacity market. But to enforce universal contracting in a real power system is hard, requiring a whole ecosystem of technocrats, compliance officers, and auditors. And it’s getting ever harder as we transition from traditional power stations supplying traditional customers. This ecosystem comes at great cost to the industry, funded by the wholesale and retail component of customers’ bills. In achieving the objective of sating energy-only market doubters the RRO clearly failed. Before the it even came into force, NEM institutions were working on a more conventional physical capacity market, which itself was overtaken by direct government underwriting through the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) and various state schemes. And AEMO’s reliability intervention powers were retained and expanded. The RRO emerged unexpectedly, in a political attempt to appease opponents to the National Energy Guarantee (NEG). Whilst the NEG imploded somehow the RRO survived. Yet it has never, as a standalone concept, been properly assessed for costs and benefits, and would seem unlikely to pass. In the search for ways to reduce the customer price of electricity, an RRO repeal could be a quick win with few regrets outside those in the customer-funded ecosystem it created. How did it come to be? The seeds of the RRO began in the South Australian winter of 2016, several months before the system black. Northern Power station had closed in May , ahead of its previous schedule. At the same time, a large South Australian customer had declined to contract ahead its load, taking a gamble to buy from spot. Whilst we can never be certain, many link Northern’s early closure to this decision. In June, a dunkleflaute event combined with an extended Victorian interconnector outage (ironically to expand its capacity) sent South Australian spot prices sky high. The customer lost its gamble and found itself paying much more than expected, a harsh business lesson. In the dismal science of economics, this outcome was a beneficial self-correction as the customer would not take the same risk again. But when a business loses money playing a market, in the eyes of the business, it is always the market, and not themselves, at fault. It put its state government under considerable pressure. In turn, the state demanded the NEM’s institutions come up with a fix, and mandatory contracting was suggested. The RRO might have then disappeared into the deep bin of electricity market ideas that go nowhere, but in 2017 it received a unexpected boost. The federal government wanted to introduce the NEG, an emissions-intensity trading scheme widely supported in industry and mainstream politics. Minister Frydenberg needed something to deflect the predictable “lights will go out” cries from opponents to any form of carbon constraint, and the RRO emerged at just the right time. Despite there being no relationship between hedging practices and reducing the power system’s emissions intensity, they were stapled , allowing the NEG’s proponents to demonstrate their reliability focus. Industry understood this political deal and kept its RRO scepticism quiet in the hope that a NEG plus RRO package might yet end the carbon wars. In 2018 the NEG collapsed spectacularly in Malcolm Turnbull’s second Julius Caesar moment. But by this time the RRO had been so strongly promoted that this part of the ship did not go down with its captain . The RRO sailed on as a stand-alone without ever being properly scrutinised . After all, who can say they oppose reliability? The industry then embarked on the great effort of designing the detail of the RRO. The RRO had been conceived from an image of firm, conventional generators selling standard contracts to meet retailers’ deterministic peak loads. If the world were thus, you could just add up a retailer’s contracted megawatts and compare to its peak load in a spreadsheet. However, it was soon discovered that the real world is probabilistic, with a whole range of generation technologies, and that risks are managed in myriads of bespoke ways . This is a wonderful thing, the types of innovation that two decades of the market had fostered. The triggers, the standard, and the ministers’ over-rides The original RRO was designed only as a mechanism that would trigger only after consistent forecasts outside the reliability standard. If an AEMO forecast 3 years and 3 months ahead (T-3) is outside the standard, then several obligations on the industry arise. If the excursion remains in a forecast 15 months ahead (T-1), then the more substantial RRO compliance obligations on retailers are triggered. This is a “double-gate”, a high hurdle that would rarely be met. However, under jurisdictional and AEMO pressure, the hurdle was soon lowered. Firstly, the NEM’s Reliability Standard of 0.002% unserved energy, equivalent to a customer average of 10.5 minutes per year off supply, which had always been promoted by the Reliability Panel as the efficient optimum, was replaced with the highly conservative “Interim” standard of 0.0006%, or 3.1 minutes . Thus, triggers became more likely. Secondly, the South Australian government disagreed with the double-gate and having failed to lobby it out of the design, demanded a derogation that allowed their minister to simply invoke the first T-3 gate in their region at will . Other jurisdictions soon wanted the same, so the RRO was changed to allow any minister to declare their region at risk, regardless of what the actual forecasts say, which leaves one now wondering the point of the first gate. Thus, the RRO is now likely to be active in much more benign conditions than was initially envisaged, creating repeated costs that consumers are funding. Converting probabilities into deterministic megawatts When T-1 is triggered, retailers must begin reporting their net contract positions to the AER which will ultimately be compared for adequacy against their customer “peak load”. This is much, much more intricate than it sounds at first glance, and the below touches on just some of the challenges. Firstly, most retailers have some of their own generation that they use to support customers. The RRO sees this as a “long” contract position, but of course some generator technologies are firmer than others and discounting is used. Capacity from demand-side response, settlement residue instruments, and energy-limited capacity such as storage can be claimed , each with different levels of “firmness”. As the RRO must be fed with a one-dimensional deterministic megawatt quantity, there is not much choice but to make crass simplifications when doing all this, which, given the industry’s growing reliance on these sources, provides little confidence that the final numbers mean very much at all to the true reliability of the power system. Secondly, there are many varied contract instruments used by the industry , from standard exchange-traded instruments to highly bespoke long-term structured deals. The AER have come up with complex guidelines to try to turn these into simple net megawatts, but they realise that this can’t possibly correctly represent everything, so they allow retailers to determine their own methodology, subject to an audit. Thirdly, there is no one number for a retailer’s “peak load”. The best each retailer can do ahead of time is develop a probabilistic distribution based on their best understanding and judgement. If the actual measured load turns out to be at an extreme of the distribution, we will never know if the distribution was wrong, or that we just saw an extreme event. The way the RRO deals with this is that if the actual peak demand for a triggered season falls below AEMO’s 50 percent Probability of Exceedance (PoE) region forecast, which should be half of the years, then compliance is not assessed and all the hard work collecting RRO data is discarded. If, however, the actual peak load is measured at, say, 105 percent of AEMO’s 50 percent POE forecast, then each retailer’s load exposure becomes their actual load measured at that time divided by 1.05. This is intended to indicate a fair 50 percent PoE to which the retailer should at least be contracted. Whilst this expost adjustment is probably the only fair thing that could be done, if the power system were only being invested to meet a 50 percent PoE demand, it would get nowhere near the interim reliability standard. That does not suggest that 50 percent PoE contract coverage necessarily implies an unreliable system, but rather demonstrates how a mathematical link cannot be made between market contracts and a probabilistic reliability standard. This leaves one wondering why we pretend a link can be made by undertaking the burdensome exercise of the RRO. When all the above numbers are crunched it is unlikely, but still conceivable, that a retailer’s net contract position falls below their expost determined 50 percent PoE. If so, the non-compliant retailer picks up some of AEMO’s intervention costs. This is an unrelated number, because AEMO is driving to a very different objective when it intervenes. Its unpredictability may be intentional, as retailers can’t forecast the penalty for being non-compliant, so presumably they’ll err on the side of caution. Market Liquidity Obligation (MLO) When T-3 is triggered, the larger generation portfolios of that region are required to “make” a market by posting continuous bids and offers for standard contracts. In this feature the RRO’s objective has morphed from reliability into competition policy. It was justified as assisting smaller retailers to achieve compliance in the lead up to a T-1 but appears behind the South Australian government’s enthusiasm for ministerial triggers regardless of the reliability outlook. Introducing a MLO through the RRO was poor regulatory practice. If there is a real competition concern in some regions, then it should be explicitly assessed on its merits and targeted action taken. Instead, a competition rule has been “tacked on” to a complex reliability mechanism without any evidentiary justification nor certainty that it is the right solution for the perceived problem. What is the point of the RRO? The supposed objective of the RRO is that a prudently hedged market is likely to be a reliable market. However, with a high NEM price cap and financiers demanding prudence in their investments, one would expect the market to be already prudently hedged without the AER having to go through everyone’s books. Importantly, as the prudence is self-assessed by those taking the actual financial risk, you can be sure it will uncover a clearer picture than an AER procedure ever could. In contrast, when all the assumptions and simplifications that go into calculating a deterministic RRO net contract position are contemplated, it is difficult to gain much confidence that the outcome means much at all. And a minded retailer should have not too much difficulty in biasing the many judgemental matters towards a more favourable representation. And even if it were possible to produce reasonable numbers, one wonders why prudently hedged retailers necessarily implies a reliable power system ? In the end, retailers only need to show evidence of financial contracts to meet the RRO. The RRO doesn’t require evidence that the contract seller has firm physical capacity. The seller may simply being taking a short financial risk themselves. A naked seller of contracts is taking the same financial risk as an unhedged retailer and identically contributing to an unreliable power system. So, if there really is an incentive for imprudent financial risk taking that must be stamped out, has the RRO not simply moved the incentive upstream? The doubters of energy-only markets saw this paradox immediately and started work on physical capacity mechanisms before the RRO was even in place. Then this was superseded by the even more centrally directed CIS and state processes. Meanwhile AEMO’s intervention activities have continued to expand. Hence the RRO failed in its objective of providing reliability confidence in the existing energy-only market, which leaves one wondering why the industry continues to bother with it? How can we get rid of it? Conceptually, the entire RRO architecture could simply be deleted at the stroke of a pen without any physical or legal repercussions, except of course to the small army of functionaries in institutions and the industry needed to keep it ticking over. Unfortunately, because of the unusual way it was introduced, the RRO exists in the National Electricity Law. This complicates its repeal because more than a Rule Change is needed. It will need advocacy of multiple institutions and jurisdictions to get it undone. This is not something that the industry will do, as after all, the industry doesn’t ultimately pay for it. Like all industry inefficiencies, it is funded up by customers in their bills. Abolishing the RRO seems like an obvious reform that could reduce consumer prices without any downsides to them, but it will need customer representatives to champion it.

Note that this peak was not ‘out of the blue’, as: 1) I’d noted yesterday afternoon (Sat 3rd Feb) that AEMO’s ‘Forecast NEM-wide ‘Market Demand’ at ~32,250MW on Sunday 4th February 2024’ ; 2) Indeed, on Friday morning 2nd Feb I’d also noted ‘Current AEMO forecasts point to higher NEM-wide demand on Sunday 4th February 2024’ .

    "title": "Summer 2023-24 demand – high or low?",
    "date": "03-02-2024 09:17:00 AM",
    "content": "This post constitutes penance for a somewhat contrary LinkedIn comment I made on Paul’s earlier post “ NEM-wide demand has been quite low through summer 2023-24 (at least to date) ” . For ease of reading, I have copied my comment in here: “The summer has been unusual with some very high maximum demands in Qld and a few solid days in NSW but nothing to speak of in the southern regions. So, few days of high peak NEM-wide demand. But if you focus on average underlying consumption, or energy used, across the NEM for Nov-Jan – including supply from rooftop PV – then this summer has seen the highest level for at least six years, up by more than 4% on 2022-23. The duck’s belly might be growing fatter but its tail and beak aren’t dropping.” If nothing else, our different takes emphasise the many varying ways used to measure and characterise “demand” in the NEM (this article contrasts just two – but there are more). Paul highlighted the fact that this summer has so far yielded few days with high NEM-wide “Market Demand” , specifically focussing on maximum levels for this measure in any five-minute dispatch interval. I countered by claiming that NEM-wide consumption (or average demand) of electricity – including energy produced by rooftop solar installations – has reached its highest level for at least the last six November-January periods, in effect saying that “NEM-wide demand has been quite high through summer 2023-24 (at least to date)” . This being the NEM, both these apparently opposing views can be simultaneously correct. A bit like Schrödinger’s Cat being both dead and alive. Definitions – boring but necessary I’ll focus on two specific demand measures: Operational Demand This is the “official” version of grid-level demand published by AEMO. It’s a half-hourly average of output from (almost) all large-scale grid-connected generators (which AEMO can measure directly), but it doesn’t include production from the millions of small-scale rooftop solar installations (“distributed PV”) which also supply the energy consumed by households and businesses. It also subtracts any energy consumed by “market scheduled loads” (pumped hydro and large-scale batteries), effectively making it net grid-level supply. Underlying Demand This is obtained by adding onto Operational Demand AEMO’s estimates of half-hourly rooftop solar production, yielding an estimate of total supply “from both ends of the grid”. It’s necessarily an estimate, since there is no way to physically measure actual production from those millions of solar systems. AEMO’s small-scale solar estimates use extrapolation of measured real-time output from suitable samples of systems to produce an aggregate value for each region of the NEM. Others on WattClarity have written about the opacity of rooftop PV data before – such as Paul here in December 2019 (noting that the APVI estimates changed after that point to be more closely aligned to the AEMO estimates, though still not the same). Paul’s post focussed on “Market Demand” which differs only slightly from operational demand in that: it excludes production from a few large(-ish) grid-connected generators whose output is not controlled via central market dispatch (“non-scheduled” generators), and it’s determined every five minutes as part of the market dispatch process, and it’s calculated at the start of the dispatch interval (as the target for what market generators need to collectively meet), whereas operational demand is a ‘backward-looking’ half hourly measurement. For most practical purposes operational and market demand track very closely although the actual values of maximums and minimums always differ because of their slightly different bases. On the other hand, “Underlying Demand” can exhibit quite different trends and levels from its grid-level cousins because it tries to account for the increasing amount of electricity consumption that is supplied by rooftop solar (about 11% for the NEM as a whole over calendar 2023). As a more holistic measure, underlying demand tells us about how much energy consumers of electricity (excluding market scheduled loads) are actually using. Grid-level demand (operational or market) is equally important, but for different reasons, as it dictates requirements on the large scale supply side of the market. So has demand this summer been low, or high? Paul was right Definitions out of the way, here’s a view of half-hourly operational demand on the top three “summer” days over each of the last nine years – I’ve defined “summer” very broadly as running from November through March, since high demand days can occur in the outlying months. The days selected are the three with the highest daily maximum demands for each year. This tends to support Paul’s claim about this summer (to date) having “quite low” NEM-wide grid-level demands, with half-hourly operational demand sneaking over 30 GW on only a couple of days, compared to pre-pandemic summers where NEM-wide operational demand peaks exceeded 32 GW, reaching a maximum of 35.4 GW back on 31 January 2020 (just before storms came through and tumbled the Heywood interconnector ). There may well have been higher operational demand peaks in prior years – I haven’t checked. I was right too But if we look through the “total consumption” lens of underlying demand, and average that across summer months (which correlates with total electricity used rather than short-term peaks in demand), we get a different result. Remember that a megawatt (MW) is a rate whereas a megawatt-hour (MWh) is a measure of volume (such as consumption). I have shortcut the process of calculating consumption by showing average demand (whereas Paul focused on peak demand in his article) … You’d need to multiply by 2,208 (the number of hours from 1st November to 31st January inclusive) to translate the average megawatt readings in the chart below to the total consumption (in MWh) over the period, but this would not change the relativities. I can only readily go back to 2016/17 for this measure as AEMO’s half-hourly rooftop solar estimates begin in May 2016. I’ve also restricted the months averaged to November-January so that we’re comparing 2023/24 on a consistent basis with prior summers. This shows us that while average operational demand (the blue component) hasn’t been high this summer – in fact the second lowest level for the last eight years – the continued growth of rooftop solar output means that this summer (so far) is comfortably in the lead for consumption (or average electricity demand). A shandy chaser I’ll finish by looking at a blended measure – using Paul’s “daily NEM-wide maximum” metric but applied to consumption – underlying demand – rather than grid-level demand. This reveals what peak levels of total electricity use have been doing, including that part of the peak met by rooftop solar. The absolute peaks here are quite a bit higher than those for grid-level demand shown a couple of charts back – so rooftop solar is knocking off a significant slice of summertime peak consumption that would otherwise have to be supplied from the grid. The quick take out from this shandied measure is that the maximum levels of underlying demand seen so far this summer are pretty much in the middle rank of recent years. Kind of an average – or quantum superposition – of Paul’s and my own conclusions. ================================================================================================= About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

    "date": "01-02-2024 06:39:00 PM",
    "content": "As noted in some conversations with clients recently, it seems there’s been some distractions in the market thus far in summer 2023-24 (hence a number of articles on WattClarity ) … but on reflection these distractions have been mostly centred on QLD: 1) Frequent readers here will remember that QLD experienced a massively larger all-time maximum demand on Monday 22nd January 2024 . … there’s a number of questions we have been puzzling over about this (will endeavour to post about this soon) 2) It’s removed from the NEM and so not our core focus, but we did notice that the South-West Interconnected System (SWIS) in WA also experienced an all-time maximum demand on Wednesday 31st Jan 2024 (i.e. yesterday) (a) as noted here by AEMO on Twitter for Wed 31st Jan 2024. (b) but then … as an in-line PS … superseded on Thu 1st Feb 2024 as subsequently noted here by AEMO on Twitter . The rest of the NEM, however, has been pretty lacklustre – in terms of levels of demand being reached. So much so that it was not a surprise to see Anthony Sharwood asking ‘When will Melbourne have a ‘real’ summer?’ on Weatherzone on Monday 29th January 2024! A couple times in writing about what’s been going on I’ve wondered how the NEM-wide demand has been tracking, but have not (till now) had time to trend. However curiosity got the better of me this evening and I opened up NEMreview v7 to produce this trend: Those with a licence to the software can open their own copy of this query here. With respect to this chart all stats quoted are ‘ Market Demand ’, and at ‘NEM time’ (i.e. UTC+10, or Brisbane time): 1) On the trend I have highlighted three high points and three low points: (a) The high points are as follows: i. Fri 8th December 2023 saw a highest point at 30,034MW at 17:05 … on a day where we wrote that ‘NEM-wide ‘Market Demand’ peaks above 30,000MW on Friday 8th December 2023 … first time since July’ . ii. Thursday 14th December 2023 saw a highest point of 29,715MW at 18:05 … a day that saw forecast LOR2 and RERT contracted in NSW. iii. Notably, Monday 22nd January 2024 . was not highlighted here: … the highest point for NEM-wide ‘ Market Demand ’ was 27,184MW at 17:45 , despite what happened in QLD! iv. Highest point (to date) was on Monday 29th January 2024 with ‘ Market Demand ’ reaching 30,680MW at 18:00 . … one of the days seeing evening volatility in QLD and NSW . (b) The lowest points are as follows i. Sunday 3rd December down to 12,542MW at 10:00 … no articles written on the day ii. Saturday 23rd December 2023 down to 12,122MW at 11:10 … lowest point thus far this summer … but still no articles written on the day. ii. Sunday 31st December 2023 was a remarkable da y of new lowest-ever points in VIC and SA: … the NEM-wide ‘ Market Demand ’ reaching down to 13,290MW at 12:55 … but note that this was not the lowest point NEM-wide this summer. 2) So only two days where the NEM-wide ‘ Market Demand ’ reached past 30,000MW … which still jumps out at me (despite writing how many articles about ‘ declining demand ’ and the rise of the rooftop PV juggernaut), considering this would have been commonplace in years gone by. Let’s see what unfolds for the remainder of summer 2023-24 !",

    "date": "29-01-2024 08:14:00 PM",
    "content": "Thanks to Nick Evans at the Australian who’s alerted me to that the Federal Court has ruled in relation to docket number QUD541/2023 relating to Callide C4 and Callide C3 failures. Nick and Angelica Snowden have already posted an article ‘Federal Court authorises special investigation into catastrophic explosion at Callide C station’ … but given the recency of the news I would not be surprised if the article in the Australian continues to evolve: Well worth a read, for those who can access. (A) Key points of background There’s probably five points that sum up the situation, at a very high level: Headline 1) The Callide C4 unit has been offline since 25th May 2021 following a major explosion in the turbine hall : … In other articles I have wondered if this would be the ‘longest outage in the history of the NEM’, but have not had time to definitively check Headline 2) The root cause of the explosion is still not publicly known . (a) Many months ago Dr Sean Brady was commissioned by CS Energy (50% owner of the Callide C station) to conduct an investigation and report back (b) But this report has not been publicly released – and, as far as I have seen, there’s been nothing formally announced as to the status of the report Headline 3) The sister unit, Callide C3, has been offline since 31st October 2022 when the cooling tower structure (which also supports Callide C4) collapsed . This has since been rebuilt. Headline 4) The coincident calamity affecting both units forced the other 50% owner (IG Power Callide (IGPC)) into voluntary administration on 24th March 2023 . Headline 5) The partial shareholder in IGPC, Sev.en Global Investments (7GI) initiated the Federal Court action in December 2023, as noted by Nick Evans at the time (and hence via WattClarity 30th Dec 2023 ). (B) Information from the Federal Court Returning to the Federal Court website (docket number QUD541/2023) this evening we see the ‘Orders’ page has been updated: … and in particular the Order (as highlighted above) opens here : … with the key part (on quick scan, and with the big caveat that I am not a lawyer) seems to be as follows: ‘2. Pursuant to s 447A of the Act, John Richard Park and Benjamin Peter Campbell of FTI Consulting be appointed as additional administrators of the first defendant (the Special Purpose Administrators). 3. Pursuant to s 447A of the Act, the Special Purpose Administrators appointed under Order 2 be empowered to carry out the functions specified in Annexure A to these Orders. ’ … which leads to Annexure A: ‘1. Conduct investigations into the cause or causes of the two catastrophic incidents at the Callide C power station, specifically, the explosion of the unit C4 turbine on 25 May 2021 and the partial collapse of the unit C3 cooling tower on or around 31 October 2022 (the Incidents), and any claims available to the first defendant against any party arising out of, relating to or in any way connected with the Incidents’ … with my emphasis added. (C) Anything from key stakeholders? As I hit ‘publish’ on this article (20:15 on Mon 29th Jan 2024) I have not seen any recent relevant updates from various stakeholders. (C1) At CS Energy I could not see anything on the news section of the CS Energy website … nor did I see any updates here on the company profile LinkedIn . (C2) At Sev.en Global Investments I also did not see anything under ‘Press Releases’ or ‘News Highlights’ on the 7GI website. (D) Information elsewhere In terms of other media outlets… (D1) At AFR On Monday evening, Primrose Riordam wrote ‘Czech coal baron wins special investigation into Callide C failures’ : (D2) On the ABC On Monday evening, Jasmine Hines wrote ‘Federal Court orders fresh investigation into explosion at central Queensland’s Callide C power station’ : (D3) Elsewhere? I have not yet seen anything else… (E) Latest information on return-to-service expectations On 15th January 2024 we wrote about how ‘Hot & Wet Weather pushes back expected return to service dates for Callide C3 and Callide C4’ : Checking again in the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view , we see that there’s been no further change , since then, of expected return to service: With respect to the image: (E1) Callide C3 This unit has been offline since 31st October 2022 (cooling tower), and the expectations for Unit 3 are as follows: (a) On 29 Feb 2024 (back to 200 MW) (b) On 31 March 2024 (back to 466 MW) (E2) Callide C4 This unit has been offline since 25th May 2021 (explosion), and the expectations for Unit 3 are as follows: (a) On 30 June 2024 (up to 210 MW) (b) On 31 July 2024 (back to 420 MW) (E3) Unit State For those not familiar with the software, the change from grey cells to red cells recently is related to a change made in the ‘Unit Status’ by CS Energy in submission to AEMO about the outages. PS1 on Tue 30th Jan – the Judgment of the Federal Court available One of our keen readers has helped me out by: 1) Firstly, understanding better the difference between an Order (noting what is to happen next) and a Judgment (noting the reasons for the Order); plus also 2) Highlighting that the Judgment is available online here : A bit more reading there, for interested parties…",

When there’s a considerable numbers of customers in the dark following TC Kirrily that crossed the coast near Townsville on Thursday 24th January (as Jennifer Brownie reminds us here earlier today). 2) This is also the first dispatch interval with the spot price exceeding $1,000/MWh … so the SMS alerts (triggered by ez2view ) have started up. 3) The IRPM of the QLD-only ‘ Economic Island ’ is down in the red zone level: (a) With net ‘Market Demand’ of 9,961MW (i.e. a little lower because of some net supply from NSW); (b) Being supplied from Available Generation of 10,908 MW (c) Meaning a local surplus of only 947 MW (d) Or an Instantaneous Reserve Plant Margin of only 9.5% (rounded up to 10% on the display) 4) This caused by constrained flow… (a) QNI flow constrained north at a relatively low level; and (b) Directlink actually constrained so it must flow south. 5) In conjunction with higher demand (as noted above) and the setting of solar generation. Worth providing an updated view of the 3 x ‘ Forecast Convergence ’ window in ez2view, focused on QLD … but now zoomed into the near-term P5 predispatch forecasts for price and demand: With this image, there are 4 notes: 1) ‘Looking up a vertical’ we see that the ‘ Market Demand ’ achieved at 17:45 was higher than earlier P5 predispatch forecasts; 2) Which means, looking out to the left (into the current P5 forecast) some uncertanty about whether these forecasts are too low; 3) ‘Looking up a vertical’ we see that the price was not seen in earlier P5 forecasts (though some price action had been expected in this morning’s P30 forecasts) 4) Looking out to the left, prices were forecast to subside … … but what actually happened?",

Some thermal units have the ability to ‘trip to house load’ (TTHL) as an additional safety measure for the grid as a whole: 1) It enables them, if there is some grid disturbance (e.g. major frequency disturbance), to trip down very quickly to minimal load, in order that they can ramp quickly to help restore system load in the event of a blackout. 2) One high profile case where this worked well was on 25th May 2021 following the initial explosion at Callide C4 catastrophe (which resulted in all units at Callide tripping, contributing to under-frequency load shedding and islanding and so on…) (a) in this case, as Allan noted here , it was the Stanwell Power Station units that successfully tripped to house load and hence helped with faster-than-otherwise restoration of load. (b) there are a number of units who are (like this) contracted for SRAS (System Restart Ancillary Services) to provide services like this. 3) I am assuming that what happened at TARONG#4 was a test of the capability – required to justify ongoing payments.",

    "title": "Policy implications now and for the transition",
    "date": "24-01-2024 09:30:00 AM",
    "content": "This is the third and final post in this three-part series on opportunity cost and how it affects offers and bids in electricity markets, as evidenced in the NEM. In my first post , I showed that prices mostly stayed within the variable costs of genreation, most offers were not and this was consistent with the economic concept of opportunity cost. In my second post , I provided a range of reasons why offer prices diverge from variable cost and according to opportunity cost. In this last post of the series, I explore policy implications now and anticipate how things will change in the continuing transition to a low-emissions generation mix. Competition and the rebidding process is crucial for keeping prices in check First, let’s explore the implications that arise out of what we’ve learned from the first two articles. The data presented in the first post indicates that, if prevailing prices are not in zone 3 (that is, not above the variable cost of the most expensive peaker), there is likely to be a sizeable portion of generation priced higher in case market conditions worsen. If market conditions do become tight, but not so tight that generation is short of meeting demand, then prices are more likely to settle somewhere between variable costs and the market price cap via the rebidding process. In the second post, we see generation offers are complicated by recovery of the fixed costs of peakers and inflexibility constraints (i.e. time to run up to minimum operating level, minimum runtime and start-up costs) and the iterative nature of the rebidding process. Together, these complications help explain some of the offers on the vulture’s perch, and their relative positions on it. Note that competition between all the peaking resources on the vulture’s perch (and potential for demand-side response) limits the price peaking resources might achieve. The outcome of that competition is a function of how tight market conditions are expected to be (it dictates how much spare generation remains after demand is met) and how long they are likely to persist (another angle on the size of the prize). Offers in zone 3 (i.e. above the highest variable cost) should provide at least a rough indication of the supply of generation in rough order of the ability to generate if market conditions unexpectedly tighten and cause them to be dispatched for a single dispatch interval. It would be operationally problematic and disrupt dispatch if generators submitted offers at the low end of the vulture’s perch to capture unexpected price spikes if they are too slow to respond to them (although this issue is mitigated if they submit accurate ramp rate limits). If the pre-dispatch schedule indicates the sudden price spike is likely to persist, then the size of the prize increases and the generators higher in the offer stack, missing out on generating at such a high price, would be expected to rebid downward to compete. The more persistent the spike, the greater the opportunity for less flexible generation to compete and the greater the competition, the more downward pressure there is on prices. We should review the rebidding process The rebidding process consists of traders shifting generating quantities between the ten offer prices they are required by the rules to submit at the beginning of the trading day (4am) and stick to for the rest of that trading day. They increase the share of their available generating capacity in prices below or above the marginal prices signalled in pre-dispatch schedules to alter their output and reflect changes in their willingness to generate. This practice causes the prevailing market price to increase or decrease, but only around the offer prices submitted by market participants at the start of the trading day. The second chart in my first post shows, perhaps surprisingly for market sceptics, this rebidding process is competitive enough that prices in the NEM very much tend to lie between the upper and lower bounds of variable costs. The challenge I offer you is to interrogate the offer data and present it in a way that reveals the role rebidding behaviour plays in achieving that outcome – how often does the rebidding process return errant sheep back into the fold? In other words, how often does iterative rebidding bring about this outcome? How the transition will affect existing bidding arrangements So how is the transition likely to affect this behaviour and set of arrangements? Here are my thoughts: Opportunity cost will have a greater impact on generation offers and prices Weather is an inherently less predictable source of fuel so market conditions and prices become more uncertain Monitoring market power becomes trickier How the existing arrangements adapt as thermal generators retire There are some rules that should be reviewed:- The cumulative price threshold regime- The requirement to specify ten offer prices at the beginning of the day- Collection and reporting of fuel constraints of all generation types- Incorporation of fuel constraints in pre-dispatch. Opportunity cost will affect more offers (and bids) As the transition deepens, we can expect generation offers in the NEM to diverge from variable cost more often as the generation mix changes away from thermal and toward renewable generation. In the lead-up to their retirement and as their numbers dwindle, greater variation in wholesale prices is forcing owners to make more opportunity cost-based decisions – is it profitable to operate or not, given low wholesale prices are expected in the next week or month or season (for example, see this news article ). Having no fuel storage, solar PV and wind generation generate whenever they can, which should lead them to conform with variable cost offer pricing to a greater extent than baseload thermal power stations. However, in some cases, they are also dragging prices down below variable cost as some of them are operating under contracts that include feed-in tariffs, which becomes a lost opportunity cost if they are not generating electricity. These renewable, intermittent resources are increasingly being mixed with more fuel-storage limited resources (eg hydro, pumped hydro and batteries). The bids and offers from these fuel-limited resources will tend to help reduce more extreme abundance and scarcity associated with very high and low wholesale prices (see the Andrés-Cerezo and Fabra paper in the sources below for how it works in theory). However, this means prices will more often diverge from variable costs and according to expectations about scarcity now and in the future. As prices diverge from variable costs more often, the magnitude and duration of wholesale price variations expected in the future are not a sign the market is in jeopardy or broken. They indicate the resource(s) that will provide the most profitable new investment. Market participants anticipate and react to the opportunities and threats caused by changing patterns of wholesale prices, which indicate the relative value and profitability of different assets and manifest in the investment in more of some resources and the potential retirement of others. For example: greater variation in wholesale prices encourages more investment in pumped hydro and batteries as this variation increases arbitrage opportunities (the market for which is regularly examined in section 1.3.6 of AEMO’s quarterly energy dynamics reports ) higher prices on average encourages more investment in wind generation (assuming there is little correlation between wind and time of day) lower prices during the day due to the duck curve invites higher consumption of electricity. Weather and weather forecasts become increasing important Given an expectation that these investment market dynamics continue and the share of renewable resources increases, generation capability becomes increasingly dependent on the weather and on weather forecasts. Being increasingly reliant on the weather, generation forecasts become both more important and more uncertain, compared with the status quo, as fuel forecasts for traditional thermal fuels are less uncertain than they are for wind, solar PV, hydro and, by extension, batteries. Unlike bids and offers based on variable costs, offers and bids based on opportunity cost include consideration of both present and future trading intervals – participants must take account of future conditions and prices. When offers and bids depend on expectations of future market conditions and prices, they inherently rely on the intentions of every other participant in the market. Consequently, an increase in the uncertainty of that future and every other participant’s intentions makes their own account of future conditions and prices more prone to error. It follows that, because our power systems are increasingly reliant on the weather, which is inherently difficult to forecast, fuel-limited generators can and will get it ‘wrong’. Without the benefit of hindsight, they can underestimate or be surprised by the magnitude of scarcity risks. They have to make a call about future conditions and they will sometimes price their fuel too low and deplete their fuel stocks faster when they might have reduced total wholesale market costs (and increased their profits) by raising their offer prices earlier. At other times, generators will overprice their fuel if they expect conditions to be worse than they turn out, which can unfortunately provide ‘evidence’ of inappropriate price gouging (unfair or not). The fundamental problem is, given the unpredictability of the weather, no one knows how bad an event might be until it is over and the stakes can be high. While this all might seem scary, it is something some markets, those dominated by hydro generation, for instance, have managed for decades. As an example of how important managing adverse weather events is in New Zealand, there was an unusually dry period at the end of 2020 and into 2021 that was the subject of a review by the Electricity Authority. Prices rose to high levels during the period as lake levels were well below what is considered prudent to get through winter months, when much of the rainfall sticks to the surrounding mountains in the lake catchments as snow. In the end, while lake storage got uncomfortably low, rainfall arrived that filled up the lakes and things went back to normal. The review found that the system worked pretty much as it should and made a few recommendations to improve the communication of the changing situation. In the future, dunkelflaute events (periods of low solar and wind output) could be of similar importance and concern in Australia, given its increasing reliance on these renewable generation technologies and storage. Monitoring market power Policy makers and regulators want confidence that offer behaviour will result in goldilocks prices that adequately (accurate seems too high a hurdle) reflect relative scarcity. Allowing generators to submit offers and set prices up to the market price cap in the NEM demonstrates a degree of faith in competition that many other policy makers have not. The data in my first post suggests this faith is justified. Nevertheless, policy makers will continue to be concerned about the degree to which the natural market failure of imperfect information might hide the systemic misuse of pricing power. One undesirable potential scenario is for fuel-limited generators to submit offer prices that suggest a higher likelihood of running out of fuel than is credible, which is inconsistent with efficient and competitive outcomes. This happens in any market where suppliers can ‘fake’ scarcity to keep prices high (for examples, see this article on the art of creating artificial scarcity ). This behaviour was found to have occurred in New Zealand during what the Electricity Authority determined to be an undesirable trading situation in November 2019. Meridian Energy was generating electricity priced at over $100/MWh despite data and video evidence showing torrents of water being spilled over the dam at one of their power stations. Note how crucial it is to monitor storage and spill so the regulator can take appropriate action to correct past and influence future actions to assure people they can trust that prices adequately reflect relative scarcity. Another relevant example, referred to in the last section, is a more reasonable one where the reviewer found that prices were acceptably high, given the circumstances. The other, even more undesirable situation, is one where fuel-limited generators are overly optimistic of the future and run dry before a weather event is over. There can even be a temptation for policy makers and regulators to be so concerned about the first scenario that generators can credibly claim this has contributed to their overly optimistic pricing. Policymakers might mitigate against these worse-case scenarios by tasking the regulator with developing a model(s) for establishing a credible value or range of values for the remaining storage, given existing and forecast data. The Electricity Authority reviewed competition in New Zealand’s wholesale market and calculated water values from 2016-2021 , publishing a review paper on the topic in October 2021. How the arrangements have to adapt to 100% renewables Fuel-limited generators and storage assets currently offer their quantities below and above thermal generator offers set at variable costs to manage their fuel stocks, which helps explain why wholesale prices in the NEM tend to be in within zone 2 (the plausible bounds of variable costs) most of the time. It makes sense that fuel-limited generators shift their output around generators that are not so fuel-constrained. If market conditions are such that supply is high, relative to demand, then fuel-limited generators output will vary around low variable cost generation like brown coal. As conditions tighten, they shadow black coal and CCGTs and when conditions are very tight, they shadow price around OCGT offer prices. The Snowy Hydro submission in the sources below provides greater insight into how it considers opportunity cost in its bidding decisions. While there is still a long way to go to achieve a renewables-dominated power system in Australia, people are already considering how things work or need to change once all thermal generators are gone. When contemplated this problem, there are two pieces of good news that help me sleep at night: The thermal generating stations or units are not retiring all at once, but in an orderly fashion over the next decades. Other markets (across the Tasman in New Zealand, for instance) that are much closer to the goal of 100% renewable generation can provide valuable insight. In theory, the NEM can function as it does now while new investment in renewable generation and storage covers the loss of thermal generation retiring. Prices should rise above variable cost more often as the prospect of being short of generation increases – how quickly and by how much is the question. While thermal generation offers have long been the price setters in electricity markets, it is the cost of non-supply that has always been the ultimate benchmark. The competition between generation resources keeps supply and prices below the level at which generation runs short and demand management is required. Again, if scarcity events increase then this creates an opportunity for more competition (or demand flex), which lowers the risk of scarcity and the associated prices. As we approach a 100% renewable power system, it would appear increasingly beneficial to become more sophisticated with respect to the consideration and treatment of the demand for electricity and how we match it with generation. It is no longer a simple matter of investing in and operating generation to meet instantaneous demand. How much demand for electricity is more flexible in time – that is, what is the opportunity cost of delaying electricity consumption? Old examples are domestic hot water, commercial chilling. New examples are all the various devices that operate on rechargeable batteries. The new trick is to find mutually agreeable schedules for market generation and demand. An abundance of sunshine and solar PV should reduce prices and encourage more consumption during daylight hours, including large and very time-flexible loads like hydrogen, ammonia, or methanol production. Large time-flexible loads are invaluable to flex when storage is decreasing and the risk of scarcity rises. New Zealand is closer to 100% renewable generation mix and it operates a wholesale market very similar to the NEM and continues to do so. However, the Electricity Authority asked the stakeholder Market Development Advisory Group (MDAG) to tackle the problem of market design in a 100% renewable generation future and it published its final report and recommendations in December 2023. As part of its work, the MDAG commissioned a report by E Grant Read that I also recommend reading (it is in the list of sources below) as he explains in detail the challenges and options for the New Zealand wholesale electricity market in a 100% renewables power system. Review of the cumulative price threshold regime The cumulative price threshold (CPT) is a financial safety valve in the NEM, designed over 20 years ago to reduce the cost of summer heatwaves, that is also expected to be of benefit to consumers. Once the sum of wholesale prices over a rolling week reaches a specified threshold, AEMO reduces the market price cap from its usual, eye-wateringly high level ($16,600/MWh) to $600/MWh (administered price). The Reliability Panel recommends a market price cap high enough to drive new investment in generating resources to satisfy consumers’ reliability expectations, with respect to generation adequacy. However, the CPT regime was designed to limit the size of the windfall gains generators make when conditions are tight over the morning/evening demand peaks for a few days (specifically for summer heat waves). The CPT is essentially a ‘stop-loss’ mechanism that reduces the liability (and associated costs) of retailers and consumers facing wholesale spot prices. This necessarily reduces the revenues for generation to be available in situations where the CPT kicks in and the incentive for retailers and consumers facing wholesale prices to buy contract cover for these events. The logic for the CPT is that, by the time it kicks in, the generators have already made large windfall gains, which means the reduction in the market price cap will have little or no effect on investment and the resources deployed so there is little to no reduction in the reliability enjoyed by consumers. However, this logic only works when the resources deployed during short scarcity events are thermal peakers. While the CPT and administered price have been raised to cope with high fuels prices since the NEM suspension in June 2022, the regime remains unsuitable for dunkelflaute events (several days or more of low wind and sunshine), which become a significant risk once storage and intermittent generation become a much larger share of generating resources. Review of the rebidding rules The problem is that fixing ten price bands at the beginning of the trading day (4am) is no longer suited for a trading environment with more varied diurnal market conditions and more opportunity cost-driven participants. Also, because the market conditions in which prices end up being set above and below variable cost are relatively rare, the circumstances are different each time. They also generally develop after the start of the trading day. Consequently, it is unlikely generators have submitted a set of prices in price below and above the range of variable costs that turn out to be efficient and this means consumers are more likely to come out worse off from these restrictions. The chart (below) displays offer prices submitted by generators in the NEM for 30 September 2022. Chart 3: Distribution of offer prices in the NEM on 30 September 2022 NEM data The chart shows a decent majority of offer prices submitted for that day (2,059 out of 3,529 or 58%) lay somewhere between -$100/MWh and $700/MWh. The chart also reveals price ranges that are sparsely populated with offers. In particular, there are relatively few (258 out of 3,529) offer prices in the large range between $1,500/MWh to $12,000/MWh, which makes it far less likely the rebidding process will end up with a price in this range. Instead, tight conditions are more likely to result in much higher prices. It is natural that generators submit more offer prices in the zone where prices are likely to settle than outside this range, where they might settle only occasionally. However, on the other hand, the vulture’s perch could be a product of the restrictions on rebidding offer prices. If so, the restrictions might have had a perverse effect, leading to higher wholesale prices rather than lower ones, as participants might be arbitrarily picking prices near the market price cap to reflect their preference not to generate. This, less than ideal, offer distribution is creates a much larger degree of tolerance around the efficiency of prices when market conditions stray out of the range where variable costs are marginal. Allowing generators to change both their price bands and their quantities has the potential for both beneficial and harmful effects on efficient price discovery. It could help traders with opportunity cost considerations (fuel-limited resources, most importantly) to offer prices that better reflect the value of limited fuel and reserve scarcity, which would be more efficient. Generators could re-bid both their prices and quantities as conditions changed, until a marginal price was reached where generators were ambivalent about altering their output any further. On the other hand (I am an economist, after all) the price discovery process might become less stable as the extra degree of freedom could induce or even necessitate more rebidding iterations for the market to settle at a more efficient price. Such an effect has the potential to reduce the potential efficiency gains from the relaxation of the requirement. However, in mitigation of this negative potential, wholesale trading is a repeat game so we should expect traders to adapt and optimise according to the marginal costs and benefits. Finally, given the increasing number of parties bidding and the huge increase in the amount of rebidding there has been since the NEM became a five-minute market, there is an opportunity to greatly reduce the amount of data traffic involved. The rebidding process is crucial to the outcomes in the NEM and so we should make it easy for people to capture and analyse the data to monitor how well it is working. The existing offer/bid form is inefficient, given that bids are deemed to be good until changed. Presently, the format of bids is a two-dimensional file containing repeated information where values don’t change. This could be changed so that only data the trader wants to change is sent, but I imagine this option comes at considerable cost. There is an alternative, much lower hanging prize. AEMO could publish a view of the bidding data that eliminates all the repeat, redundant data. This is not a difficult task for a data administrator and would greatly reduce the size of the datafiles, which I understand are presently are over 400 million rows a day. I would be surprised if removing the redundant data didn’t at least halve the number of rows and size of the file. Review of what we collect and publish on fuel-constraints and available storage Given the increasing share and importance of storage in the control of many participants, wholesale prices are increasingly dependent on the collective view of the effect of future market conditions to value the remaining stores of energy. Therefore, it would be beneficial to make changes to the scheduling process so everyone is aware of the collective state of charge/fuel supply limits in the pre-dispatch timeframe. This extra piece of information should improve price discovery and efficiency. It will also provide an important piece of information that help builds confidence that wholesale prices adequately reflect scarcity. At present, the rules require generators to rebid to ensure they can fulfil schedules produced under the pre-dispatch and other PASA (projected assessment of system adequacy) processes. However, we simply do not know the degree to which outcomes in each schedule are feasible with respect to the limitations in the capacity of each battery and pumped hydro station to generate/discharge and charge. As the amount of battery and other storage resources increase, the integrity of pre-dispatch schedules decreases as infeasible outcomes are more likely to occur (I.e., NEMDE charging or discharging batteries that are already full or empty) and more rebidding effort is required to adjust them. Adding a requirement on traders to submit and keep state of charge and fuel supply (in MWh) accurate and include in their bids their upper and lower limits could help NEMDE maintain the integrity of the schedules derived from the pre-dispatch and short-term PASA process. Publishing total MWh storage in each NEM region over the scheduling period could also help all participants better understand important limitations that affect the supply situation. This should help them rebid according to the risk of scarcity and overabundance (I.e., running out of energy or having so much it must be spilled). Finally, it is important, from a social acceptance perspective, for the market operator to publish all the information pertinent to the bidding process and for market monitoring agents (public and private) to assess and present how well or poorly storage is being managed to keep prices low and reliability that meets societal expectations.

    "title": "Putting Monday’s record-breaking demand in QLD into context (22nd Jan 2024)",
    "date": "23-01-2024 03:26:00 PM",
    "content": "Yesterday’s hot and muggy weather saw QLD’s peak market demand land at 11,036MW in the late afternoon. That mark overshot the previous daily maximum by 875 MW – that’s an 8.61% increase on a record that was set just three days earlier . To put that into context, yesterday was the largest amount that this figure has been broken by in the past 24 years of the NEM. Below I’ve charted the top 20 occurrences of a new daily maximum regional market demand record, ranked by the absolute increase from the previous record. By looking at the chart you should immediately notice that there is a large gap comparing yesterday’s events in QLD, in absolute terms (i.e. megawatts), to the next closest day. There is also a significant gap in recency – with yesterday being the only entry in this ‘top 20’ list for almost six years. We should also keep in mind that the 875 MW increase yesterday is only compared to the prior record set three days earlier (which itself broke the then-prior record by 42MW). For further context, the below chart is a timeline of the progression of maximum market demand for each of the NEM’s five regions. We see that peak demand (by this measure) in QLD has now surpassed peak demand in VIC. In both of these charts, I’ve purposely ignored the period-of-time before Jan 1st, 2000 (the NEM began in late 1998, so hence very early records may not have been indicative of material changes in demand), as well as figures for the now-abolished SNOWY region. What demand? As always, I must note that there are several different measures of demand – each of which is useful depending on what you are trying to analyse. Here at WattClarity we generally track and provide commentary on ‘Market Demand’, or what is known as TOTALDEMAND in the AEMO’s MMS database. For our purposes as market watchers, this is the most relevant measure of demand because it is the most accurate capture of how much demand needs to be catered for by ‘things’ that the AEMO can dispatch/control through the market. Market demand is therefore the sum of : Local Scheduled + Semi-Scheduled Generation minus Local Scheduled Loads Interconnector Flow at the Regional Reference Node Wholesale Demand Response As well as: Forecast Demand Change & Aggregate Dispatch Error Questions that remain We’re still trying to make sense of what did and did not happen in QLD last night. In the AEMO’s August 2023 ESOO , the 1-in-2 year peak demand level for QLD was 9,932 MW for Summer 2024, and the 1-in-10-year peak was projected to be 10,373 MW. Last night the operational demand level reached 11,005 MW during the 17:00 interval. This potential forecasting miss has prompted questions from others in our team about the long-term implications. In relation to actual consumption yesterday evening, some underlying factors may have also influenced where demand figures landed: News.com.au is reporting that 41,000 properties in Southeast Queensland experienced thunderstorm-related outages during the early evening yesterday. I noted some posts on social media about residential users’ consumption being curtailed due to their participation in the Energex PeakSmart Air-Conditioning Program Over the coming days and weeks, our team will surely dig through the many questions that continue to puzzle us. Editor’s note: (2024-01-23 8:56PM) Correction – the quoted ESOO forecast values are on a ‘sent-out’ basis, where as the actual demand value is on an ‘as generated’ basis. For reference, the POE10 forecast on an ‘as generated’ basis was 10,822 MW in the August 2023 ESOO data set – which is closer to the actual outcome but would still signify that yesterday’s demand levels exceeded the implied 1-in-10 year probability. My apologies for any misinterpretation caused.",

    "title": "Powering Up: Queensland’s Historic Leap in Energy Use",
    "date": "23-01-2024 12:45:00 PM",
    "content": "Yesterday’s (Mon 22-01-2024) record demands from Queensland’s (Qld’s) energy sector has indicated unsurprising significant shifts in energy demand patterns, with the Operational Demand receiving considerable attention in reports [1,2,3]. Alongside this, the increase in Native Demand, or Underlying Demand, (Total Demand + Non-Scheduled Generation + Rooftop PV) to 13,014 MW, which is a clear indicator of the growing nature and significant influence of behind-the-meter (BHM) Rooftop PV installations. This summary aims to present various types of demands and their record-breaking figures, considering possible underlying factors. The record high for Qld Native Demand was 13,013.9 MW at 16:00 hrs on Mon 22-01-2024, a 10.82% increase from the previous peak of 11,743.2 MW at 14:45 hrs on Fri 19-01-2024 – see the graph below for Native Demand Records since AEMO started publishing BHM Rooftop PV in March 2018. This record, which includes Qld Total Demand, Non-Scheduled Generation, and Rooftop PV, coincided with a period of extremely high temperatures and high apparent temperatures for a period of week, particularly in and around South East Qld and Brisbane. Additionally, this period marked a return to school and work for many, along with holiday seekers from the rest of Australia on their last week of school vacation, all factors that likely contributed to the surge in energy use. Additionally, the Maximum Rolling 1-Day Mean Qld Native Demand saw a significant rise, reaching 9,728.9 MW at 23:00 hrs on Mon 22-01-2024. This was up 629.14 MW (6.91%) from the previous 9,099.7 MW at 05:55 hrs on Sat 20-01-2024, reflecting a week of persistently high temperatures without much relief. Furthermore, the Maximum Rolling 7-Day Mean Qld Native Demand also set a new record at 8,692.0 MW at 23:00 hrs on Mon 22-01-2024, up 242.34 MW (2.87%) from the previous 8,449.7 MW at 23:00 hrs on Sun 21-01-2024. These increases are most likely again exacerbated by the extended period of high temperatures. GPE NEMLog-Lite: Moving Annual Qld Native Demand Records – Max Instant, Rolling 1 and 7 Day Means Notably, the article’s lead graph showing Qld’s energy shares and demands does not account for interconnector losses, going some way to explaining the discrepancy between Native Demand and sum of the energy source contributions plus the binding maximum imports from NSW. Other significant Qld Demand records include: Qld Total Demand + Non-Scheduled Generation reached 11,154.5 MW at 16:50 hrs on Mon 22-01-2024, an 8.82% increase from 10,250.7 MW at 17:30 hrs on Fri 19-01-2024. Qld Total Demand was 11,036.2 MW at 16:50 hrs on Mon 22-01-2024, up 8.61% from 10,161.0 MW at 17:30 hrs on Fri 19-01-2024. Qld Operational Demand achieved 11,005.0 MW at 17:00 hrs on Mon 22-01-2024, 9.28% higher than 10,070.0 MW at 17:30 hrs on Fri 17-03-2023. Further details are available in the Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) comprehensive 29-page document [4], which offers in-depth insights into these demand types. These developments in Qld’s energy sector underscore the impact of both climatic conditions and social patterns on energy consumption.

    "title": "Unpicking the generation mix in QLD over the past four days",
    "date": "22-01-2024 01:29:00 PM",
    "content": "Over the past four days, extreme humidity and high temperatures have been driving record electricity demand in the sunshine state. As we’ve reported on WattClarity, the recently set record is forecast to be broken once again later today (with an LOR2 condition currently forecast ). In this article, I’m going to do a short examination of each component of the region’s generation mix over the past four days – the period spanning between Thursday January 18th to this morning January 22nd – to understand the supply-side dynamics of these extreme market conditions. To begin, the image below is a high-level summary of the QLD dispatch price, market demand, and generation mix over the past four days. A high-level summary of price, demand, and generation in QLD over the past four days Source: NEMreview This chart has been trended on a half-hourly cadence (as opposed to the 5-minute cadence of the NEM) to account for the availability of rooftop PV estimate data. In relation to this image above, I point out some key features of the chart: Very high demand (by any historical measure) in QLD in the early evenings. Before this, the record for market demand in QLD was 10,119MW. Very high late afternoon/early evening prices on Thursday, Friday, and Sunday, hugging the market cap on both Friday and Sunday. These high prices coincided with relatively tight margins between available generation and market demand. A consistently low contribution of wind generation over these days. Also small (but perhaps important) contributions from hydro, liquid fuel, and battery. That’s just a high-level summary to preface the bid/offer data displayed below. Paul and the team have already delved into some of the more specific outcomes and constraints in the market. We have published further, more in-depth, coverage of market outcomes for Thursday , Friday , Sunday , and the evolving conditions for later today . Bids/Offers per Fuel Type This analysis has been compiled together very quickly, but to dig a bit deeper, I’ve used our bids & offers widget within ez2view to have a look into how each component of the generation mix performed. The charts below show stacked generator bid volumes in QLD, broken down by fuel type. In each of these charts, the look-back period is 5 days from 11 am this morning. The faint dotted blue line shows the resulting QLD dispatch price (RRP) which relates to the right y-axis. It is important to note that rebids would have played a significant role in price outcomes yesterday (and not just in QLD..) – as time permits, we hope to come back and examine how bids evolved and converged on actual outcomes. Black Coal Let’s begin with the biggest contributor to the fuel mix over the past four days – black coal. QLD’s black coal fleet has a combined 8,583MW of maximum capacity, but I note the long-term outages at Callide C3 (466MW) and Callide C4 (420MW) and shorter-term deratings of several units, particularly at Millmerran and Tarong . The screenshot below from ez2view shows the trended bid volumes amongst these coal units stacked by offered price, where from first glance we can see: Only a small fraction of volumes were offered in the higher price bands (>$10,000/Mwh) during those early evening demand peaks over the past four days. A small margin of remaining available generation during those periods. Gas ‘Gas’ has been broken up into ‘Natural Gas’ and ‘Coal Seam Methane’ here. QLD’s 11 ‘Natural Gas’ units combine for a total of 2,097 MW of maximum capacity. With respect to the trend of bids/offers for these units, I note the following: From a quick look at our Generator outages widget in ez2view, I note that Yubulu2 (84MW) and CPSA (144MW) have been available significantly below maximum capacity in recent days for reasons I have not had time to investigate yet. Very very little available volume offered above $300 during the demand peaks on Thu 18th, Fri 19th, or Sun 21st. In addition to these units with the ‘Natural Gas’ fuel type, there are also the additional seven Coal Seam Methane units at Braemar with a combined maximum capacity of 1083MW. For these units, we see a larger volume of available generation undispatched in the higher price bands. Hydro QLD’s Hydro contingent is made up of three stations, consisting of eight scheduled units – Wivenhoe (570 MW), Kareeya (88MW), and Barron Gorge (66MW) – for a total of 724MW of maximum capacity. It is important to note that the latter is currently offline due to flooding associated with Cyclone Jasper . From a glance at the bid stack within this fuel type, I note: A wide spread of offered volumes across substantially different prices. A very consistent 88MW (Kareeya) being offered at negative prices (and then hence being dispatched); Higher volumes at negative prices are being dispatched during peak times (early evening), whilst partial volumes are being dispatched near the market cap signifying that some of these volumes are near the top of the bid stack. Wind There are currently five Semi-Scheduled wind farms active in the market in Coopers Gap (440MW), Dulacca Wind Farm (173MW), Kaban Wind Farm (152MW), Kennedy Energy Park (43MW) and Mount Emerald (178MW) – which all combine for a maximum capacity of 986 MW. From the image below I note the following: Virtually all of the volume from these five units has been offered between -$1,000 to $0 over the past four days; however Wind availability has been relatively poor, with peak generation over this period running at roughly 50% capacity factor, but particularly poor during daylight and twilight hours. Large Solar QLD’s Semi-Scheduled large solar fleet has a combined maximum capacity of 3,061 MW. Bid volumes here are fairly straightforward and atypical: These volumes almost entirely being offered at negative prices Typical diurnal pattern of solar availability Liquid The three kerosene units at Mount Stuart near Townsville combine for a maximum capacity of 443MW, and they have been running exclusively during early evening demand peaks. Battery (Discharge) The Wandoan BESS (100MW), Bouldercombe BESS (50MW), with Chinchilla Battery (100MW) make up QLD’s Scheduled battery contingent – although Chinilla is yet to enter full operations. The chart below shows the wild swings in final bid volumes that eventuated, where I note: Large swings in bid volumes offered (via the auto-bidders that these two units employ). A low state of charge (i.e. low available generation) was only seen in the early evening of Sat 20th and Sun 21st. This analysis has been put together quickly, but hopefully, these charts provide some insight into the underlying supply-side dynamics over the past four days (and perhaps provide insight into what may eventuate this evening).

    "content": "An oppressively hot and humid air mass will increase energy demand in southeast Qld on Monday. A very hot air mass will sit over the southern half of Qld on Monday, with temperatures likely to reach the mid-40s in the state’s southwest and the mid-to-high 30s in the southeast, including Brisbane. Image: Maximum temperature forecast for Monday, January 22, according to the ECMWF model. Unfortunately for anyone living in southeast Qld, Monday’s heat will be exacerbated by high humidity, which will make the air temperature feel around 4 to 8ºC warmer than it is. At 10:20am AEST on Monday, the temperature in Brisbane felt like 40.5°C, despite the temperature reaching only 34°C. This sweltering ‘feels like’ temperature was due to excessive levels of water vapour in the atmosphere, with a dew point of nearly 26ºC at the time. The dew point is the temperature to which air must be cooled to achieve a relative humidity of 100%, or saturation of moisture in the atmosphere, at which point condensation will occur. The higher the dew point, the greater the amount of moisture in the atmosphere, which makes it more difficult for human bodies to cool down through the evaporation of sweat. Below is a guide for how different dew point temperatures would make you feel if you were accustomed to Australia’s sub-tropical climate: >24ºC – Oppressive, uncomfortable for most, possible heat stress issues 20-24ºC – Muggy and quite uncomfortable 15-20ºC – Starting to feel muggy, though still comfortable for most 10-15ºC – Comfortable 5-10ºC – Dry < 5ºC – Very dry The map below shows the high dew points forecast over the region on Monday afternoon. Image: Dewpoint and wind forecast at 3pm AEST, according to ACCESS-C The ‘feels like’ temperature in parts of Brisbane should reach the high 40’s and in some areas could possibly hit 50°C on Monday afternoon. According to Watt Clarity , the Brisbane area could see an all-time maximum energy demand record set in response to this heat and humidity in the late afternoon. Afternoon thunderstorm activity is also possible in western Brisbane, which could increase cloud cover and reduce the performance of rooftop solar in the region. This could add even more pressure on the energy grid. Fortunately, a southerly change that is moving up the northern NSW coast on Monday morning will make its way up to Brisbane by the early evening. This southerly is expected to arrive in Brisbane around 5:30-6:30pm AEST, bringing relief from the heat and humidity as it sweeps through the city. The temperature in Brisbane will drop significantly behind this change and should reduce the stress on the energy grid dramatically.

Here’s an updated view of the ‘Generator Outages’ widget as at 07:45 dispatch interval ( NEM time ) on Monday morning 22nd January 2024: It’s a similar, though not identical, picture to that seen on Friday. 1) Thankfully, there’s no other outages marked for QLD units, or units in NSW … thought I did see YWPS4 (in VIC) switch off at 02:25 this morning – I’ve not checked the reason. 2) We see that the outage (Status = ‘Unplanned Forced Outage’ ) at Millmerran unit 1 has been brought forward to tomorrow . 3) There’s been no change to the outage (Status = ‘Unplanned Forced Outage’ ) at Tarong unit 2. Let’s look quickly at a bit more: Millmerran unit 1 Let’s start with a ‘zoomed in’ view of ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget , focused on the MT PASA DUID Availability data and filtered down just to the MPP_1 unit: From this we see that it was Saturday morning that saw the unit’s outage brought forwards , to start this evening or tomorrow (i.e. a partial reversal of the ‘delay’ move made last week). Looking to see if there’s anything in recent rebid reasons to show what the underlying issues might be, here’s the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view , looking back 14 days and filtered down just to MPP_1: Many of the rebid reasons suggest a limitation with the mill(s) and/or feeder(s) and/or limitations in the CV (calorific value of the coal). Perhaps there is something in there that’s going to be the focus of the imminent repair outage? Tarong Unit 2 In this case the outage has not shifted – so let’s go straight to the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view , looking back 14 days and filtered down just to TARONG#2: In this case it’s clear the unit is suffering a tube leak : 1) Which resulted in moving to ‘Fixed Load’ bids on 15th January; 2) And which has deteriorated … to the point where availability was dropped further on Sunday afternoon (i.e. yesterday).

    "title": "14-year trend in growth of maximum demand in Queensland",
    "date": "20-01-2024 02:08:00 PM",
    "content": "Following the heated demand activity in QLD on 30th Dec & 31st Dec 2023 , and then on 18th January & 19th January 2024 (and looking forward to Monday 22nd January 2024 ) I thought it would be worth this short article to show a trend of daily maximum* demand in Queensland, using NEMreview v7 . * It’s been more common to write about the trend towards declining minimum demand . Remembering the gory details of the different measures of demand, I’ll highlight the main two ones we speak about: (A) Daily Maximum Market Demand Firstly let’s look at ‘ Market Demand ’, because that’s what many market participants refer mostly to – as it relates most closely with NEMDE processes and dispatch outcomes (dispatch targets, prices, and so on …) Those with a licence to the software can open their own copy of this NEMreview trend here . Peak demand is clearly summer focused in Queensland. Over the longer term we can clearly see three phases in the trend: 1) From 2010 to ~2014 we see a trend of declining peak demand … due initially to these types of reasons , before the growing juggernaut of rooftop PV took over as the main reason in later years. 2) From 2015 to 2019 there was steady growth in peak demand … with a large deriver being the introduction of electric compression of upstream CSG to supply the Curtis Island export projects 3) From 2020 onwards there’s been a range of competing factors that means some years demand has increased, some years it has not. These factors include: (a) COVID-19 (b) La Nina years (c) Population growth, coupled with ongoing roll-out of airconditioning load. (B) Daily Maximum Operational Demand Next let’s look at ‘ Operational Demand ’, because that’s AEMO increasingly refers to as representing what they manage the grid to meet, from a ‘keeping the lights on’ perspective: Those with a licence to the software can open their own copy of this NEMreview trend here . Interestingly, in the chart above I have answered my own question from yesterday – Operational Demand seen on Friday 19th January 2024 was not a new all-time maximum . One might scratch their head to understand why the difference, but we’ll leave that for another day… (C) Tabulated (selected) high points I only highlighted some of the high points in the trends above – these are listed in the table below, linked to earlier articles for those who have an interest: Day Peak demand event Tue 22nd Jan 2024 We’re not there yet … what will the peak demand be on this day (and will it be a new record)? Fri 19th Jan 2024 On Fri 19th Jan 2024: (a) A new record for ‘Market Demand’ peaked at 10,161MW at 17:30 … which was 42MW higher than the prior all-time maximum set on 17th March 2023. (b) But this was not the case for ‘Operational Demand’ 17th March 2023 On 17th March 2023 : (a) A high point for ‘Market Demand’ was 10,100MW … but this was not quite a new record.

    "title": "‘Market Demand’ briefly peaks at a new all-time maximum in QLD (at 17:30 on Friday 19th January 2024)",
    "date": "19-01-2024 07:09:00 PM",
    "content": "Well, that was a very hot and sweaty walk home from the office today. Over the ~hour long walk, my phone was buzzing with plenty of SMS alerts (triggered in our ez2view software, but also accessible in some of our other tools) … and these are ongoing. So let’s briefly unpack a few things: (A) New all-time maximum for demand in QLD Perhaps most* notably is that the QLD demand briefly peaked above the previous all-time maximum. * depends on a reader’s individual perspective (A1) Measured as ‘Market Demand’? As captured in this SMS alert, the ‘ Market Demand ’ peaked up at 10,161MW in the 17:30 dispatch interval ( NEM time ). As noted there, the demand peaked at 10,161MW at 17:30 … which was 42MW higher than the prior all-time maximum (which was ). (A2) Landed ‘hotter’ than forecast Using the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view and time-travelling back to 17:30, we see that (by ‘looking up a vertical’ ) the actual level of ‘Market Demand’ was well above what was forecast beforehand in the AEMO’s P5 Predispatch forecasts: (A3) So what about ‘Operational Demand’? Now frequent readers will remember there’s much gory details in relation to the various measures of demand – and that the AEMO increasingly uses an ‘Operational Demand’ measure because that relates to some of their ‘keeping the lights on’ challenges. Time permitting in a subsequent article we might look more into what happened in terms of ‘ Operational Demand ’. (B) Tight supply-demand balance Here’s a snapshot of NEMwatch taken at 18:45, after I arrived home and after the new all-time max: Notably: 1) ‘ Market Demand ’ is still well up in the ‘red zone’ … up at 9,957MW at this time 2) The supply mix has ramped up, in terms of supply from ‘Keeping the Lights on Services’ because: (a) Solar’s close to bedtime by this time; and also (b) Supply from the few wind farms in the QLD region was quite modest (aggregating to 140MW at the start of the 17:30 dispatch interval). … remembering that we posted this snapshot of individual station outputs at 16:25 , in a future article we might delve into more of the fuel supply mix. 3) Prices are elevated in QLD (at $14,928.01/MWh … well on the way to the Market Price Cap ) … and also slightly up in NSW 4) In terms of the interconnectors: (a) At least QNI is flowing north, but running at a limit of only 388MW north. (b) Whereas Directlink is being constrained such that it must flow south. 5) Because of the constraints on both interconnectors, there’s a QLD-only ‘ Economic Island ’ formed, meaning it’s on its own for additional demand: (a) The net demand being supplied in that ‘Economic Island’ is 9,703MW … i.e. lower than the ‘Market Demand’ because some of it was being supplied in net terms from NSW (i.e. imports via QNI are larger than exports south via Directlink) (b) This is being supplied from 10,493MW Available Generation; (c) Leaving a local surplus of only 790MW; (d) Or a very tight 8% IRPM ( Instantaneous Reserve Plant Margin ) for the ‘Economic Island’ … so well down into the red zone. 6) Not shown here, but there were Actual LOR1 conditions during some of this period. There’s much more that could be noted … but we’ll leave that till later… (C) Volatility The NEMwatch snapshot shows some volatility for a single dispatch interval – here’s the initial run of SMS alerts today (before they continued to scroll off the screen: (D) More to come, about today… When time permits next week, we’ll dig into this in more detail. (E) Stay tuned for Monday?! A reminder at this point that it may well be that the new record is short lived, and is ratcheted higher still on Monday 22nd January 2024 .",

(A) Forecast LOR conditions cancelled … for now? Here’s an update (i.e. from 15:35 NEM time ) on the ez2view snapshot I included in this morning’s article: Note in particular that: 1) The forecast LOR conditions have been cancelled for Monday at this point; and 2) The forecast ‘ Market Demand ’ for Monday evening has cooled somewhat, compared to the earlier forecasts. … though still up in the red zone. (B) Two coal units to watch No doubt the trading rooms that are QLD focused will be keeping an eye on what’s unfolding over the weekend. Out of interest, here’s the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view (at 15:00) filtered to just the coal units and sorted with QLD units at the top: Of particular interest are two units highlighted – and discussed below… B1) The Millmerran 1 unit has pushed back an ‘Unplanned Forced Outage’ First one highlighted is the MPP_1 which … 3) has an ‘Unplanned Forced Outage’ scheduled to start on Monday 29th January 4) But also noted is that the unit has been running at reduced capacity over the past couple weeks; 5) And looks like it is set to continue running at reduced capacity through until when it comes offline for an outage. Opening another copy of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget to view the MT PASA DUID Availability data, but focused on the MPP_1 unit, we see the following: With respect to this window: 6) As noted on this image, the unit’s short-notice outage has been pushed back a few days till after the high demand (and tight supply-demand balance) days. (a) I’ve not looked further, to see if anything visible about the cause (e.g. might be a tube leak?) (b) In any case, will be another unit to watch closely … (c) Whilst that should (hopefully) be all good, if the unit is operationally challenged for the period it might be that the unfortunate happens and it trips off prior to our during the stressful Monday evening period. B2) Tarong unit 2 has recently planned an ‘Unplanned Forced Outage’ Second unit highlighted is the TARONG#2 unit, which … 7) has an ‘Unplanned Forced Outage’ scheduled to start on Saturday 27th January In this case, we flip the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget to view the MT PASA DUID Availability data, but focused on the TARONG#2 unit, we see the following: As noted on this image: 8) It was only on the MT PASA DUID Availability run for 18:00 on Wednesday 17th January 2024 that this outage was introduced: (a) Again, I’ve not looked further, to see if anything visible about the cause (e.g. might be a tube leak?)

AEMO has not yet estimated the latest time it would need to intervene through an AEMO intervention event. AEMO Operations ——————————————————————- END OF REPORT ——————————————————————- So useful to add in this snapshot from ez2view (a mashup of 3 copies of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget focused on three different QLD-focused metrics as at 09:50 today, but extended out to the ST PASA time horizon): With reference to the numbered annotations: 1) Looking back at yesterday’s ‘ Market Demand ’ and ‘looking up a vertical’ , we see that the demand forecast was initially high (when in the ST PASA look-ahead), then cooled somewhat before warming again to the point of what actually unfolded … again reinforcing the vagaries of the weather, and hence the challenges with forecasting these types of metrics. 2) Looking at ‘ Market Demand ’ forecast for this evening , we see that the forecast (now accessing P30 predispatch) has cooled somewhat compared to earlier … but what will actually unfold? 3) Looking forward to the ‘ Market Demand ’ forecast for Monday 22nd January 2024 , it’s clearly the ‘hottest’ forecast in the grid , and (looking at the red-ness) currently the forecasts are getting hotter : (a) Last night when I wrote this on Tuesday , the forecast for Monday evening was that it might reach ~9,500MW (only included a chart, did not write the number down); (b) Last night when I wrote this the forecast was that this might reach 10,372 MW ; (c) As it stands, (i.e. in the ST PASA run for 09:00 today) the forecast is that it might reach 10,752MW . … which would easily be a new all-time maximum … no wonder the colours are getting redder! 4) Coincident with this ‘hotting up of demand forecast’ we see that the progressive forecasts of Available Generation are getting more blu e … … which, with this metric, means the numbers are getting bigger (which is a good thing ) 5) A combination of both (plus AEMO’s forecasts of interconnector capability, not shown here), leads to the emergence of the forecast LOR2 condition for QLD on Monday evening.

    "title": "‘Market Demand’ in Queensland peaks at 9,790MW on Thursday 18th January 2024 … Monday 22nd Jan *might* see a record?",

    "content": "At ~15:40 today we posted ‘ Demand (and price) spiking in QLD on Thursday afternoon 18th Jan 2024 ’ … at the time expecting QLD’s Demand to climb higher and hence (combined with declining Available Generation and constrained imports from NSW) drive some evening volatility. (A) Where did demand peak? As it stands (at the 18:00 dispatch interval) it looks like the ‘ Market Demand ’ might have peaked at 9,790MW in the 16:30 dispatch interval . Here’s two sequential views of the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget * in ez2view , Time-Travelled back to two different points in time, looking at ‘ Market Demand ’ in Queensland: * Remember that this widget allows one to ‘ look up a vertical ’ to see ‘ that other dimension of time ’. (A1) Time-Travelled to 16:30 Here’s the first snapshot: We see: 1) At the top of the ‘now’ column, the ‘Market Demand’ landed at 9,790MW. 2) Looking down that column (i.e. backwards in time, to earlier P5 predispatch forecasts) we see earlier forecasts had been that demand would have been higher. 3) Looking out to the right (i.e. into the future, with the ‘current’ P5 predispatch forecast) we see that the forecast was that the demand might get as high as 10,014MW by 17:25 (i.e. in 55 minutes from ‘now’). (A2) Time-Travelled to 17:25 So out of curiosity we open another copy of the widget, and wind that new window forward to 17:25: With this window we see: 4) Looking up the vertical (i.e. from the earlier forecast for 17:25 through until reality) we see the expectations for ‘ Market Demand ’ progressively cooled … so landing at 9,672MW at 17:25 (342MW below the earliest P5 forecast, and remembering howthe P30 forecasts are not directly comparable – not least of which because of tripwire #1 and tripwire #2 ). 5) Looking out to the right (i.e. into the future from 17:25) we see the forecasts for periods after that also progressively cooled. (B) Looking ahead, over the coming days Two days ago (on Tue 16th Jan 2024) we’d noted (in the article ‘Forecast temperature rising in Queensland for Thu 18th Jan 2024 (and Fri 19th and Mon 22nd)’ ) that demand levels were expected to be higher still on Friday 19th January (i.e. now tomorrow) and Monday 22nd January.

As noted on this chart… 6) Highlighted on the chart is quite a sharp drop in Air Temperature at Archerfield (a better proxy for airconditioning load than temperature at Brisbane airport). 7) The current forecast for ‘ Market Demand ’ for tomorrow evening (Fri 19th Jan) is that it will be slightly lower than what was achieved today (a) Note that this is coming from the P30 predispatch run (b) Current forecast peak is WHAT at WHEN 8) But the current forecast shows that ‘ Market Demand ’ for Monday 22nd Jan could be a doozy: (a) Remembering this is coming from ST PASA (i.e. further out); (b) The mouse-over shows 10,372MW forecast for WHEN ; (c) Which would (if it eventuated … remembering the uncertainty involved!) would be a new all-time record. (d) Keeping in mind that the all-time record (by that measure) currently sits at 10,119MW … set for the dispatch interval ending 17:30 on Tuesday 8th March 2022 . Stay tuned … PS1 – volatility Thursday evening For completeness I’ve attached record of the SMS alerts received on Thursday evening (triggered by ez2view when any region’s spot price elevated above $1,000/MWh): Nothing further to add…",

    "title": "Why generation offers diverge from variable cost",
    "date": "17-01-2024 11:22:00 AM",
    "content": "This post follows my last one on opportunity cost and how it shows up in the generation offer stack in the NEM. In this post, I consider a range of reasons why generation offers might diverge from variable cost and how pricing at opportunity cost is not a misuse of market power. Please check out the published articles in the Sources section at the end of the post for published articles on the economic concepts discussed in this three-part series of posts and how they apply to electricity markets. Wholesale market bids in the NEM diverge from variable cost because, like any other imperfect market, participants have market power sufficient to be able to profitably alter market prices. What follows is an explanation of how the following resources participating in the NEM are motivated to offer or bid according to opportunity cost: fuel-limited generation resources resources with relevant operational inflexibilities high variable cost generation price-sensitive consumption batteries and pumped hydro resources. Bidding opportunity cost is not necessarily a misuse of market power Before we start, it is important to consider the concept of market power. In general, many people are (rightly) distrustful of the competitiveness and outcomes from markets where there is relatively low demand elasticity and a large chunk of consumption is considered an essential good or service. It also doesn’t help when suppliers can set their own prices! However, most people would agree that prices, as a general rule, should reflect relative scarcity. That is, prices should rise above variable cost in scarcity and fall below variable cost in certain circumstances during overabundance. It follows that generation offers that diverge from variable costs are social welfare enhancing and efficient if they signal genuine scarcity or overabundance and should not be considered a misuse of market power. Having said that, it is beholden on participants and regulators to monitor the market and call out pricing behaviour that doesn’t appear to be in keeping with market conditions – i.e., pricing power that does not reflect genuine scarcity or abundance causes the good or service in question to be priced artificially low (which could erroneously drive out or discourage competition) or at prices higher than supply conditions warrant (creating artificial scarcity). Fuel-limited generators price according to opportunity cost In this examination of situations where opportunity costs affect offers, we will start with fuel-limited generating resources, a constraint naturally associated with hydro generating units. A fuel-limited generator is one that is constrained from generating electricity at full output over a relevant time horizon (could be minutes, hours, days, weeks, months) by a limited supply and stock of fuel. Hydro generators do not offer all their water fuel at variable cost, which is very close, if not equal, to zero if it is gravity-fed from a lake. As the water stored in the lake is limited (i.e., you can run out if you operate at full output for long enough) and filled only by sporadic rainfall events, pricing your entire stock of water at variable cost is not an efficient use of scarce fuel. With limited fuel storage and uncertain supply (i.e. lake storage and rainfall), the price a hydro generator is willing to accept to use its water to generate electricity is a function of its existing stock of fuel and expected prices and rainfall in the future. This means the value of its fuel right now depends on how much it might make instead by storing that fuel and using it to produce electricity later (the value of the next best option or opportunity cost). For more information on the economic theory behind the value of water to hydro generators, check out Diana Tam’s article in the sources below. When water stored behind a dam is being depleted by using it to generate electricity, it is rational and profit-maximising for such a generator to allocate its scarce fuel to generate more electricity when it has the most value, over a given time horizon. As lake storage is depleted the value of a hydro generator’s remaining water tends to increase and vice versa. At one extreme, the value of a hydro generator’s water fuel is at or below variable cost when the lake is full and the generator must spill water. At the other extreme, the value of its remaining water can climb very high as lake storage is depleted toward minimum thresholds of lake storage. Pricing offers to reflect potential fuel scarcity is not only profit-maximising but societally efficient due to the high value consumers place on electricity supply and an upward sloping supply curve. Conserving fuel for future use increases the price of electricity now, encouraging other, higher-cost, resources and demand response to take its place. In return, this conservation displaces at least some of the output required of resources and demand response/management at those high prices in a later period. That is, conserving limited stocks of fuel now should mean there are more supply available later when the value of electricity is higher. Put another way, conserving fuel lowers supply now and increases prices now, but this conservation increases supply later and lowers (even higher) prices in this future period. Ideally, this means less higher value demand is shed in the later period. In the sources below, I’ve included a link to a submission by Snowy Hydro Limited to the AEMC that reveals details about its hydro bidding practices and its thoughts around opportunity cost. You should note three implications from fuel-limited generators pricing according to opportunity cost: Prices right now become a function of how market conditions and prices are expected to turn out in the future. Reallocating scarce fuel from intervals of lower prices to intervals with higher prices tends to make prices converge in the time horizon over which limited fuel is being allocated, which could be hours, days, weeks or even months. When offers and prices are equal to variable cost, the price in every trading interval is equal to the short-run marginal cost. This is not the case when opportunity costs affect prices over multiple trading intervals. Because generation offers and prices depend on expected future market conditions and rely on competition to increase or decrease generation, a fuel-limited generator’s offer is implicitly a function of the offers of every other generator. This insight has policy implications I’ll talk about in my next post. Thermal power stations can also experience fuel scarcity Fuel scarcity is a natural consideration for the owners of hydropower stations. However, from time to time, fuel supply problems at coal and gas power stations can also force traders to switch to the same fuel-limited trading behaviour as hydro generators. There were reports of coal supply problems in June 2022 (see slide 24 in Origin Energy’s FY2022 results presentation , for example) just as there were several years ago in the months that followed the surprise announcement of the imminent closure of the Hazelwood power station. It is also possible that large jumps and falls in the price of thermal fuel in the future (another sign of changing fuel scarcity) can affect offer prices now – if they are known, these may be signalled over weeks or days rather than changing from one trading interval to the next on the day they occur. Advance signalling of the increasing likelihood of higher cost fuel is similar to hydro generators’ efficient trading behaviour so it should not be automatically considered to be a misuse of market power. Operational inflexibilities force opportunity cost considerations Opportunity cost is also a relevant consideration for any generating unit not flexible enough to turn on and ramp up to full output within a single trading interval or ramp down from full output to zero within a single trading interval. This inflexibility forces generators to consider and price their offers according to the potential revenue and associated shutdown/startup operating costs over multiple trading intervals according to the limits of their flexibility, causing prices to diverge from variable cost in each trading interval. Wind and solar PV generation may also have start up and shut down inflexibilities. However, on its own, being output-constrained by the availability of wind or sun just makes the quantity of electricity they can produce and sell more variable than gas- or coal-fired turbines. A profit-maximising generator considering whether to ramp up (or down) or turn on (or off) estimates the cost/value of the alternative over the number of intervals affected by its inflexibility. The decision is further affected if the generating unit incurs extra costs when it starts up or shuts down or if it must maintain a minimum level of output to operate safely or stably. Generating units might also need to remain off for a minimum period of time after they are turned off or they may prefer to remain running for a minimum period before they are turned off. These operational inflexibilities and costs are different from the recovery of other fixed costs because they are related to output. However, they have a binary (i.e., operating/not operating) over a specific period (shutdown/startup time), rather than a linear, relationship with output and often have a significant effect on a generator’s decision to turn on/off or remain on/off. For example, the threshold offer price for turning off is signalled in offer prices below the generator’s variable cost while the threshold price to turn on is above it to reflect a desire to cover any significant startup/shutdown costs. For instance, some thermal generators incur costs or a heightened risk of tripping the unit if it is dispatched below a minimum safe operating threshold so they usually offer this minimum quantity at prices in zone 1 (i.e. at or below zero). This ensures that prices must usually be very low for long enough to warrant switching of the generating unit(s). In this way, consideration of opportunity cost can cause wholesale market prices to be lower than variable cost, not just above it. Understandably, if prices are expected to be below variable cost for some time, then eventually switching off becomes the lower cost alternative (ie cost of absorbing prices below variable cost is higher than costs associated with switching off) and the generator amends its offer, either bidding unavailable or raising its offer prices well above the prevailing price. Note that operational inflexibilities affect renewable resources, too, and not only due to engineering considerations such as ramping and minimum operating limits. For instance, hydro generators may operate according to complicated instantaneous and time-based restrictions on the use of water. For example, water use must be below a specified flow rate per hour or higher/lower than a specified throughput per day under specific conditions. Generators with high variable costs may also price at opportunity cost Generators with high variable costs have a problem recovering their fixed costs. Often referred to as peaking generators, they operate only occasionally so they have to recover their fixed costs (including economic profit) in short periods to remain profitable. Because competition is imperfect, market conditions can become tight and generators have market power when they do. At those times, merchant (uncontracted) peakers are unlikely to offer all their generation at variable cost or they would not cover their fixed costs even if they were flexible enough to turn on and reach full output in a single dispatch interval and switch off in the next. However, having the NEM the widest range of wholesale electricity prices in the world helps mitigate against free-for-all merchant pricing by peaking generators. The potential high and low prices create large financial risks that encourage retailers and generators in the NEM to agree forward contracts that help cover their fixed costs and incentivise them to offer the contracted quantities at variable cost. Price-sensitive consumers consider opportunity cost Electrification throws up more activities that consume electricity that may be price sensitive and constrained by inflexibilities. Much like a peaking generator, the traditional demand response is to switch off devices using electricity when prices reach very high levels, which occur only occasionally. Similar to peaking generation, the total cost associated with an upcoming period of high prices (or benefit of an incentive payment) is compared with the utility or profit from the use of electricity by some device (i.e. opportunity cost). There are also some discretionary processes, such as the production of ammonia, methanol or hydrogen, that could be bid so as to consume more electricity when it is of low value and less (or none) in times when it is high cost, over a given time horizon, referred to as “normally-off” scheduled load. Some of these discretionary processes might also be limited by production orders, meaning they could behave much like the opposite of hydro generator – i.e. producing only what they need to fulfil orders and choosing to do so at the lowest prices over a given time horizon. A similar situation might occur in the future for hydrogen production. Batteries and pumped hydro are special Batteries and pumped hydro resources are special because both their discharging/generation and charging/consumption are limited by their storage capacity. When they aren’t operating to provide network support or FCAS, their wholesale market trading is sometimes referred to as temporal arbitrage. Arbitrage is the practice of buying something in a market at a lower price and simultaneously selling it in another market at a higher price. Temporal arbitrage is similar but it involves taking advantage of price differences in a single market at different times – buying low now and selling high later (the same market becomes two when split between time periods). When they are engaged in temporal arbitrage, both the costs and revenues of pumped hydro and batteries are closely linked to wholesale prices and they seek to maximise their revenues and minimise their costs by taking advantage of the price spread in the future, not the absolute prices themselves. A swing in the price from $10,000/MWh to $10,450/MWh is the same opportunity to them as a price swing from $100/MWh to $550/MWh. Check out the paper by David Andrés-Cerezo and Natalia Fabra in the sources section for more information how temporal arbitrage works to reduce price volatility. Prices diverge from variable costs over different time horizons Note that the effect on wholesale prices from decisions based on opportunity cost varies depending on the time horizon relevant to the traders making those decisions. The effect of inflexible start-up and shut-down times on wholesale prices could extend from one or two five-minute trading intervals up to many hours ahead, in keeping with the fuel resource and their limitations in a particular market. For example, the storage capacity of batteries and many pumped-hydro schemes are typically measured in hours. However, hydro lake storage can range from fractions of days to years, for example: The Scandanavian and some South American electricity markets includes hydro lakes storing multiple years of demand for electricity. This makes them slow to fill and drain and causes prices to move equally slowly. Hydro lakes in Tasmania can store over a year’s consumption of electricity in the State. Hydro lakes in New Zealand hold several weeks’ worth of nationwide consumption. Storage available in states of the NEM, other than Tasmania, likely sums to only several hours of regional consumption, at most. Note that, in general, if there are no constraints on generating capacity to meet demand, then materially increasing the level of fuel/charging storage will slow the rate of change in wholesale prices in response to changing market conditions and vice versa. What changes are implied by this and the transition? So now we understand some of the ways in which resource limitations affect offers, my third and final post will explore how things change as the NEM transitions to a low-emission generation mix and what policy changes we might usefully make.

    "date": "17-01-2024 10:57:00 AM",
    "content": "Editor’s note: Mitch recently posed his thoughts about the AEMO’s draft 2024 ISP on LinkedIn. Mitch was happy to share them here on WattClarity, as we believe his comments and quesions would be of interest to our readers as well. I’ve had a chance to read through the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) draft 2024 ISP over the last couple of weeks. Well done to AEMO, they’ve done a good job at what is a very difficult task. Some highlights: We are increasingly relying on consumer resources to do the heavy lifting, which in turn eats the lunch of utility-scale renewable energy profits that benefit all The need for gas is increasing, and hydrogen is now assumed to be part of the gas mix- I’m skeptical for several reasons The need for people is a major constraint – no surprises there The supply chain constraint sensitivity in Appendix 2 is interesting, and to me should not be modelled as a sensitivity but an actual, although the recovery in the chart seems incredible! There are also some big questions marks mostly around the deliverability of the plan. In particular, I’m struggling to understand how the Delphi Panel voted Step Change as the most likely scenario for the following reasons: Offshore wind enters the market as early as 2030 – this seems highly unlikely, given global supply constraints of offshore wind installation vessels and other constraints like transmission connection infrastructure and suitable locations Capacity build of onshore wind in the Step Change scenario is heroic out to 2030, in the year 2026-27 alone nearly 7,858 MW of wind is assumed to be built, and a further 17,041 MW in the following 3 years. The record year for added utility scale capacity in the NEM was 2019-20 at 3,505 MW. Do we actually think we can build nearly 8GW of wind in 2026? A significant portion of the total additional utility-scale generation is built in the next 6 years, 38% of utility-scale build-out across the 26yr window occurs in the first 6 years. The plan assumes 47,888 MW of utility-scale capacity will be built by 2030, this is an average of 7,981 MW a year, well over double the annual record to date. The additional rooftop solar added by 2050 is astronomical, and perhaps actually achievable too given the incentive for consumers to reduce their bills, however, the plan also assumes very ambitious hydrogen demand which peaks during the day. There’s very little evidence that this will play out, it’s my view that commercials will push hydrogen plants to run 24/7 which will do nothing to solve the duck curve issue and only exacerbate the capacity issue. Removing hydrogen would result in far more battery storage required than is forecast in the plan, or massive curtailment of rooftop solar. (election risk anyone?) Major transmission project timelines, particularly in NSW are optimistic at best Workforce needs are massive, we are heavily under-resourced and the addition of workforce to the NEM seems ambitious without a shift policy ASAP.

    "title": "Forecast temperature rising in Queensland for Thu 18th Jan 2024 (and Fri 19th and Mon 22nd)",
    "date": "16-01-2024 12:01:00 PM",
    "content": "Apart from a burst of hot weather on two hot-and-high-demand days in Queensland on Thu 28th Dec 2023 and Fri 29th Dec 2023 , it’s been a pretty mild summer 2023-24 to date (at least temperature wise). Is that going to change? On Tuesday morning 16th January 2024 the AEMO published Market Notice 113308 relating to a Local Temperature Alert at Dalby in southern Queensland: ——————————————————————- MARKET NOTICE ——————————————————————- From : AEMO To : NEMITWEB1 Creation Date : 16/01/2024 10:18:38 ——————————————————————- Notice ID : 113308 Notice Type ID : GENERAL NOTICE Notice Type Description : Subjects not covered in specific notices Issue Date : 16/01/2024 External Reference : NEM Local Temperature Alerts for QLD from 16 Jan 2024 to 20 Jan 2024 ——————————————————————- Reason : AEMO ELECTRICITY MARKET NOTICE AEMO’s weather service provider has issued forecast temperatures equal to or greater than the NEM Local Temperature Alert Levels for listed weather stations below. QLD Dalby Ap (37+ Deg C): 18th Jan The NEM Local Temperature Alert Levels are: Launceston Ti Tree Bend: 33 Deg C, Dalby Airport: 37 Deg C, for all other selected weather stations: 39 Deg C. AEMO requests Market Participants to: 1. review the weather forecast in the local area where their generating units / MNSP converter stations are located and, 2. if required, update the available capacity in their dispatch offers or availability submissions consistent with the forecast temperatures. Further information is available at: https://aemo.com.au/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/nem-forecasting-and-planning/forecasting-and-reliability/projected-assessment-of-system-adequacy/nem-local-temperature-alerts AEMO Operations Planning ——————————————————————- END OF REPORT ——————————————————————- As noted at the page linked above, the AEMO issues these alerts because: 1) pretty much all types of generation plant can be adversely affected by high temperatures … (a) as illustrated (with real data) in the article ‘Extreme temperature effects on generation supply technology’ from 11th February 2020. (b) that article used data from the GRC2018 (c) but remember that, since then, we’ve included stats for each individual unit on the ‘B’ Page of each year’s edition of the Generator Statistical Digest : i. Such as illustrated here for the GSD2022 (released just under a year ago today); and ii. To come soon in the GSD2023 . 2) The AEMO requires the operators of these plant to ‘bid in’ realistic capabilities of these units under high temperature conditions, when they are forecast to occur … such as is the case above for the Dalby area of southern Queensland for this Thursday. 3) Given the temperature alert is for the Dalby area, this alert could potentially be relevant to plant such as: (a) peaking units, like the Braemar A and Braemar B stations. (b) combined cycle units, like Darling Downs CCGT (c) coal units like Tarong. (d) solar plant, like Oakey 1 and Oakey 2 solar farm; and also (e) wind farms, like Coopers Gap wind farms (f) batteries, like Wandoan. In parallel with these high temperature alerts, we have noticed that AEMO was forecasting LOR2 (and LOR1) tight supply-demand balance warnings for the Queensland region … as shown here in this snapshot for the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view from 11:25 today (Tue 16th Jan 2024) looking forwards: Remember that this widget allows one to ‘ look up a vertical ’ to see ‘ that other dimension of time ’. Note that these warnings were cancelled in the ST PASA forecast run published at 09:00 this morning. Out of curiosity I opened up this pre-configured 14-day view for the Queensland region (7 days back, 7 days forwards) from ez2view online to see what’s forecast in terms of Market Demand , and also Available Generation: Readers with their own licence to the ez2view software can open their own copy of this query in a browser here. We see that ‘ Market Demand ’ levels above 9,500MW* are currently being forecast for the evenings of Thursday 18th, Friday 19th and Monday 22nd January 2024. * Readers should keep in mind that the all-time record (by that measure) currently sits at 10,119MW … set for the dispatch interval ending 17:30 on Tuesday 8th March 2022 . That’s more like what we’d expect to see for summer 2023-24 .",

    "date": "15-01-2024 03:38:00 PM",
    "content": "On the 20th of December, I noted an announcement from CleanCo that their 66MW Barron Gorge Hydro Power Station suffered major damage due to flooding associated with Cyclone Jasper. Late last week, CleanCo CEO Tom Metcalfe provided a radio interview with ABC Far North in which he explained that water levels during this flood were the highest recorded in the 60 years of the plant’s operations – with weir levels reaching above 12 metres. The concrete spillway of the weir, which stands roughly 6 metres tall, remained intact after the flooding. It was the earthen embankment on the right side of the river that was damaged due to erosion from the flood waters – and will now need to be rebuilt in order for the water behind the weir to be controllable again. He suggested that the station could be brought back at a reduced capacity initially, stating “we are looking at a way to potentially bring the station back on sooner in maybe a partial operation mode, maybe not at full capacity, maybe not for the full duration each day that we would normally run the station – that’s sort of a temporary solution”. In regards to a full return-to-service he stated, “at the moment we are looking at the end of June for full operation”. A full inspection and assessment of the damage is still ongoing and he was unable to provide an estimate of the repair costs at this stage. As of this afternoon, the Barron Gorge units are still marked as offline until July 1st 2024 according to the latest MTPASA data published by the AEMO. Source: ez2view’s Generator Outages widget",

    "title": "The effect of opportunity cost on wholesale prices in the NEM",
    "date": "15-01-2024 02:59:00 PM",
    "content": "Opportunity cost is a crucial yet sometimes overlooked and even misunderstood concept, which has a significant impact on wholesale electricity prices. This is the first in a series of three posts that explain how the economic concept of opportunity cost affects wholesale electricity prices – that is, how fuel and operating limits cause wholesale electricity prices to be higher or lower than variable cost and why this causes the bids or offer prices of some resources to be a function of every other bid and offer in the market. In this first post, I will show how generators in the NEM operate in line with this concept in their spot trading activities, whether they are familiar with it or not. In the next post, I’ll list the ways in which opportunity cost plays an increasingly important role in forming wholesale prices as the transition deepens. Finally, the insights in the first two posts have policy implications, which I’ll talk about in my third and final post. Please note that I’ve included a list of published articles and a webpage in my sources section at the end of the post that provide more detail on the topics covered. Simple models of electricity markets omit opportunity cost A simplified explanation of how competitive wholesale markets for electricity work in a 20th century context (ie at the time electricity markets began) posits that generators price their generating capacity according to variable cost – the cost of their fuel. At the bottom of the offer stack (equivalent to a supply curve) is variable renewable energy, then comes brown coal, then black, then gas and lastly distillate-fuelled generating units. The implication of this model is that the price of electricity in any trading interval should be equal to the cost of fuel of the marginal generator dispatched to produce it (this being how wholesale prices are determined). Like many explanatory models, this one presents an ideal set of circumstances that oversimplifies reality. It suggests that, under ideal conditions (ie perfect competition), the generators require compensation equal to holding fuel at cost. However, no market experiences ideal conditions and the operation of suppliers are inevitably subject to operational constraints and uncertainty about current and future prospects, which conspire to require them to submit offer prices that diverge from variable cost at times. However, despite competition being weak enough to profitably do so, there are conditions when it is efficient (ie it is also in consumers’ interest) for generation to be priced above (or below) variable cost. In fact, looking at it the other way, it is efficient for generators to offer their generating capacity at variable cost only if they: have low variable costs (ie low enough in the stack that infra-marginal rents recover all their fixed costs) are never short (or expect to be short) of fuel are never switched off or are capable of ramping up to full output in one dispatch interval and ramping down from full output and switching off in a single dispatch interval. Note that actions to reduce demand are also based on consideration of opportunity cost. To be efficient, the opportunity cost of demand flex is equal to the value of the activity aided by electricity and this value often increases the longer demand is being held back (stores of domestic hot water in an electrically heated cylinder, for example). The value of the next best alternative So, what exactly is opportunity cost? In essence, opportunity cost is the value (expressed in monetary cost) of the next best alternative you forgo when you make a choice between different options. For instance, if I am at home and decide to go to the shops, then I have implicitly chosen to give up the experience I would have if I stayed at home. Knowing myself well(!), I might make the choice to go to the shops because I figured I would be happier doing this than my alternatives. The opportunity cost of using my time to go shopping is the happiness I would have derived from doing the next best alternative activity at home. You can check out the youtube video in my sources (below) as it provides three examples that help explain the concept. The short-run marginal cost of any good or service is based on opportunity cost. In the last section, I described the conditions under which the opportunity cost of a generator is efficiently and profitably equal to its variable cost. That is, the generator has already deployed the capital and other means of production to generate electricity and has plenty of fuel and operating capability such that its only rational choice is whether or not to expend the cost of its fuel to produce electricity. However, this leaves plenty of scope for opportunity costs to diverge from variable cost. Evidence of opportunity cost in the NEM I have prepared two charts that demonstrate how opportunity cost affects offers and prices in the NEM. The first chart (see below) provides a snapshot of the offer stack in Victoria. It doesn’t much matter when it was taken as the offer stack has a similar profile at other times and in other regions. The number of MW offered and the share of MW in each of the three price zones varies from day to day and region to region but the features of the profile remain the same. Chart 1: Shape of the generation offer stack in Victoria on 16 March 2022 Source: NEM data I’ve defined pricing zone 2 as the range of offer prices between zero and an amount ($300/MWh, which would have seemed conservative until the middle of 2022!) intended to cover most variable costs considered by a simplified economic model of an electricity market. Note that the offered quantity of generation in this zone is the lowest (less than 20% of total MW offered in this interval). I appreciate the data is two years’ old but will provide an update in a later post. By identifying the zone where offers may be directly related to variable cost, offers in the other two price zones (by definition) are not based on variable costs. Prices of offers in Zone 1 are below zero and in this interval they make up a little less than half the total MW offered. Prices of offers in Zone 3 are above $300/MWh and they make up a little over one-third of the total quantity offered in this interval. This means that just over 80% of offers in this interval are not priced in a range that would reasonably reflect variable costs of generating electricity! Now take a look at the second chart, which shows the share of wholesale prices in each of the three zones in Victoria every year since 2008 up to 2021. Chart 2: Share of wholesale prices in Victoria in each pricing zone Source: NEM data The first thing of note from this chart is that offers priced in Zone 2 (variable cost zone) set prices most of the time – over 95% of the time before 2021. The second thing of note is that, since 2018, following a large influx of new renewable (solar and wind) generation, the incidence of prices below (not above) variable cost has been rising. The conclusion from an examination of these two charts is that wholesale prices in the NEM tend to be within a zone consistent with the variable costs of thermal generating units, despite offered quantities in this zone being less than 20% of the total quantity of generation offered. At face value, it appears remarkable that prices conform with the simplified model despite the poor odds! Note that offer prices well above and below the expected price have little impact on the outcome – the further away they are, the more market conditions have to change to force a reconsideration of the offer. In essence, prices at the bottom of the stack are set primarily to ensure a generating unit is dispatched, given expected market prices . It follows then that prices at the top of the stack are set primarily to ensure a generating unit remains in reserve, given expected market prices . However, if demand or supply changes enough to shift market prices into zones 1 or 3, then we should expect offers to change, accordingly. For more information about the dynamics of bidding in the NEM, I recommend reading Professor George Yarrow’s paper provided in the sources below. Also, consistent with the narrative around the increasing share of zero-variable cost renewable generation in the NEM, we can see that the spread of prices in the NEM suggests opportunity costs have more often caused the short-run marginal cost of electricity to be below variable cost. Finally, note that Chart 1 can be generalised to define the three offer and pricing zones for any electricity market: Zone 2, comprising quantities offered in the zone of prices that encompass variable cost, that is, between a low price threshold (eg zero) and a high price threshold at the cost of the highest priced fuel used to generate electricity Zone 1, comprising quantities offered below the low price threshold defined for Zone 2 (ie zero) Zone 3, comprising quantities offered above the high price threshold defined for Zone 2. In my next post, I will provide a variety of reasons why generators are offering generation at prices that diverge from variable cost and explain why this it is efficient for them to do so.

    "date": "15-01-2024 11:39:00 AM",
    "content": "In Australia we’re in the midst of summer 2023-24 . 1) apart from two hot-and-high-demand days in Queensland on Thu 28th Dec 2023 and Fri 29th Dec 2023 , this summer’s been turning out significantly differently than I had expected when the BOM declared that El Niño and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) were underway in September 2023. 2) Shows the complexities involved in (understanding of) complex weather patterns! On (one part of) the other side of the world, in North America they are experiencing winter 2023-24 . From afar we’ve been watching a steady stream of updates about various challenges, including: 1) Rolling load shedding in Hawaii about a week ago; 2) Very tight supply-demand balance in Alberta in the past couple days; and 3) Another round of concerns about supply-demand balance in Texas; …. plus more Each of these locations seems to possess their own series of commentators who are positing a variety of views about the extent to which the various local efforts to manage the energy transition is exacerbating (or not) these supply-demand challenges. Which reminds me that some of our readers pointed out back in November 2023 that FERC released its Final Report on lessons from ‘Winter Storm Elliott’ … the Christmas 2022 storm that contributed to power outages for millions of electricity customers in the Eastern half of the country: Final Report Lessons from Winter Storm Elliott (168 pages) Media Release You can download the main document as PDF from here : A few key pieces of information in the report: ‘From December 21 to 26, 2022, in the Event Area, a total of 1,702 individual generating units—47 percent natural gas-fired, 21 percent wind, 12 percent coal, 3 percent solar, 0.4 percent nuclear, 17 percent other (oil, hydroelectric and biomass)—experienced 3,565 outages, derates, or failures to start Ninety-six percent of all outages, derates, and failuresto start were attributed to three causes: Freezing Issues (31 percent), Fuel Issues (24 percent) and Mechanical/ Electrical Issues (41 percent). Of those outages, derates, and failures to start, 55 percent were caused by either Freezing Issues or Fuel Issues, as shown in Figure 7 below. Natural Gas Fuel Issues (a subset, but the majority, of Fuel Issues) were 20 percent of all causes, and issues with other fuels were four percent. In addition to the outages, derates, and failures to start caused by Freezing Issues, those caused by Mechanical/ Electrical Issues also indicated a clear pattern related to cold temperatures—as temperatures decreased, the number of generating units experiencing an outage, derate or failure to start due to Mechanical/Electrical Issues increased. (p19-20/168 in the PDF) … and in terms of recommendations … ‘the Team urges prompt development and implementation of the remaining revisions to the Reliability Standards recommended by Key Recommendation 1 from the 2021 Report to strengthen generators’ ability to maintain extreme cold weather performance. Additionally, the Team suggests robust monitoring of the implementation of currently effective and approved cold weather Reliability Standards to determine if reliability gaps exist. The Team includes several recommendations to prevent generating unit freeze issues, one targeted at those units that failed above their designated operating limits, and three applicable to all units. Another recommendation suggests that Generation Owners communicate changes in their operating limits to the BA in real time. The Team also recommends a technical review of the individual causes of cold-related mechanical/electrical generation outages to reduce the frequency of these outages and inform whether additional Standards are needed. Finally, the Team recommends another blackstart study, like the one currently being conducted for the ERCOT Interconnection in response to Recommendation 26 from the 2021 Report, but ocusing on the Eastern and Western Interconnections. … and more … ’ (p21/168 in the PDF) There’s more information in this News Release from FERC: This includes the quote: “The FERC and NERC teams analyzed what happened, what went wrong, and the steps utilities, grid operators and stakeholders must take to avoid this in the future,” FERC Chairman Willie Phillips said. “I want everyone to take time during this Reliability Week to read this report and begin implementing these recommendations, particularly those addressing the interdependence of gas and electricity. The report highlights what I’ve called for before: Someone must have authority to establish and enforce gas reliability standards.” “Winter is upon us, and the energy sector needs to implement these recommendations as quickly as possible. As the report lays out, we narrowly dodged a crisis last year. Had the weather not warmed up on Christmas Day, it is highly likely that natural gas service would have been disrupted to New York City,” said Jim Robb, NERC President and Chief Executive Officer. “I echo the Chairman’s call for an authority to set and enforce winterization standards for the natural gas system upstream of power generation and local distribution. The unplanned loss of generation due to freezing and fuel issues was unprecedented, reflecting the extraordinary interconnectedness of the gas and electric systems and their combined vulnerability to extreme weather.” Our readers (both in Australia and elsewhere) might like to read through this report in parallel with what’s currently happening …",

Nothing further to add, at this point. PS1 back online, Tue 16th Jan 2024 A quick note, for completeness – the unit began the process of coming back online (ramped to 137MW) in the 20:15 dispatch interval on Tuesday 16th January 2024 … which was slightly earlier than initially envisaged.",

    "title": "Hiccups over, at Loy Yang A4?  (Part 3)",
    "date": "14-01-2024 01:16:00 PM",
    "content": "On Tuesday 9th January 2024 I wrote about ‘Hiccups at Loy Yang A4’ , and then on Thursday 11th January 2024 I wrote ‘Hiccups continue, at Loy Yang A4’ following another trip/outage of the units … the 4th in a short space of time. This is the third article in a series , and follows some questions I’ve received … and discussion I’ve noticed on social media. (A) Loy Yang A4 is back online First and foremost, let’s start by noting that Loy Yang A4 units is back online (at least at the time of this article). I wrote Part 2 following a trip of the unit around 12:25 NEM time on Thursday 11th January – but I was then otherwise occupied, and did not see the unit start back up later on Thursday. Here’s a broader summary of activity at LYA4 unit via ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view as at 12:10 on Sunday 14th January 2024: From the return to service later on Thursday 11th January 2024 we can see the unit’s been operating similarly to how it was a month ago (prior to the forced outage that kicked this whole thing off). (B) Loy Yang A, in the Victorian region Some of the questions I’ve received (and otherwise seen in social media commentary) have revolved around the significance of Loy Yang A (and particularly the A4 unit) in the broader Victorian region. So I thought it would be useful to summarise a few points… (B1) Aggregate levels (in MWh), and averages (in MW) Remembering that a megawatt (i.e. MW) is a measure of a rate of production and a MWh is a measure of a volume … let’s start with a look at the aggregate level of significance of the station. I’ve prepared this query using NEMreview v7 to help provide some context to the overall level of energy supplied by the 4-unit Loy Yang A station into the Victorian region of the NEM (and the Loy Yang A4 unit in particular): Those with their own licence to the NEMreview software can open their own copy of this query here . With respect to this chart: 1) this chart looks back 9 years from the end of 2023 and … 2) looks at how the supply mix supplying consumption in Victoria has changed on a monthly basis over that period – including both: (a) monthly average* levels of production in Victoria from all the various fuel types. (b) and also average* level of support from (or to) other regions, where: i. average levels of aggregate import (from TAS, SA and/or NSW) are shown above the line as positive numbers, ii. whilst average levels of aggregate export (to TAS, SA and/or NSW) are shown below the line * so readers might multiply these averages by the ~720 hours in a month (different for each month, obviously) to calculate a volume of energy (in MWh) supplied in each month. 3) There’s many things that are apparent in this trend, but here’s a couple big ones: (a) The fuel mix has changed significantly in VIC over that period (especially with the increased share supplied by VRE) … though brown coal still supplies the largest share (b) There was a step change reduction in brown coal in April 2017 following the closure of Hazelwood . 4) Over the 9 years shown, there are three broad periods in terms of inter-regional flows : (a) Up until Hazelwood closed, VIC was a strong exporter; (b) The closure of Hazelwood changed that, leading to months where VIC imported more than it exported. (c) But from the start of 2021 the VIC region has been growing more export dominant again. … I’ve not looked in detail at the reasons for this (readers should remember that this might be due to factors inside VIC, or outside VIC, or both). Focusing specifically on the Loy Yang A station (and the LYA4 unit) I’ve extracted the data to excel and compiled the following view: The key point here is that, in terms of aggregate volume of energy supplied, the LYA4 unit typically supplies between 5% and 7% of the total volume of energy consumed in VIC each month. 1) This dropped to 0% in a couple months historically where the unit was out for the whole month 2) … so that’s the reason why I’ve also shown one quarter of the aggregate percentage supplied by all 4 x Loy Yang A units (i.e. an ‘average per unit’). 3) … and we see the numbers line up quite well. (B2) Supply sensitivity at time of tight supply-demand balance Remembering that LYA4 is back online at the time of this article (so hopefully the hiccups are behind it) there’s an academic question some might ask about the significance of the unit at times of tight supply-demand balance . Because summer 2022-23 and summer 2021-22 and summer 2020-21 saw lower levels of demand (e.g. due to La Nina and COVID lockdowns etc), we have to case our mind back to summer 2019-20 to when Victoria supply-demand balance was particularly stretched. The two-day period 30th and 31st January 2020 particularly comes to mind, as explored in the article ‘Case Study of high AggSchedTarget on Thu 30th Jan 2020 and Fri 31st Jan 2020 (part 1!)’ published in August 2023: That analysis was focused on NEM-wide data ( not Victoria in particular) and also looked at Aggregate Scheduled Target (not supply from any particular scheduled station or unit (like LYA4)) … but at some point we might add another part to that Case Study . For now we’ll leave that on the back-burner: 1) Because (as noted above) LYA4 unit is back online; but also 2) But also because the weather experienced so far this summer 2023-24 in Victoria, and demand patterns that have ensued (particularly on 31st December 2023 ), seem to suggest a low probability an extreme event like this might eventuate this summer. (a) As we see here in this trend from NEMreview: (b) but reader’s beware that I am certainly not a meteorologist (and there may still be surprises in store)! That’s all for now…",

    "title": "The early wind farms reaching 20 years: how are they performing?",
    "date": "11-01-2024 09:38:00 AM",
    "content": "Over my Christmas break, I came across a nostalgic LinkedIn post from former Pacific Hydro CEO, Rob Grant, who reminisced over the 20th anniversary of the commissioning of Challicum Hills Wind Farm in Victoria. As Rob notes, the wind farm achieved many firsts for utility-scale wind generation in Australia. Similarly, I’ve also seen Fleur Yaxley, who was the project manager, retroactively dub it as ‘ the project that launched an industry ‘ . Although Challicum Hills was given a 25-year life expectancy , the current CEO of Pacific Blue (formerly known as Pacific Hydro) Domenic Capomolla states that he is optimistic that the generator can extend its lifespan beyond 2030 . This statement, along with further social media comments wondering about the potential LCOE for the project has peaked my interest to loop back to some analysis I published in early November. In that short piece , I pondered the curtailment and site scarcity effects across wind farms by the year they were first connected to the NEM. Here I’m going to focus in on the long-term technical and commercial performance of the NEM’s first batch of utility-scale wind farms . In this case study I’ve selected the seven units in the table below as 1) there was sufficient data on each project; and 2) they are all likely to be in, or approaching, the final 5 years of their expected design life. Table 1: Seven of the oldest utility-scale wind farms in the NEM Wind Farm (DUID) Region Max Capacity Approx. Construction Completed Original Expected Lifespan Reported Construction Cost (AUD$ at the time *) Challicum Hills Wind Farm (CHALLHWF) VIC 52 MW August 2003 Source 25 years Source $76m Source Starfish Hill Wind Farm (STARHLWF) SA 35 MW July 2003 Source 25 years Source $65m Source Woolnorth Wind Farm (WOOLNTH1)** TAS 140 MW Bluff Point – August 2004 Studland Bay – June 2007 Source N/A $172.5m $80m Bluff Point & $92.5m Studland Bay Source Lake Bonney Stage 1 Wind Farm (LKBONNY1)*** SA 81 MW June 2005 Source 25 years Source $236m $700m for Stage 1, 2, and 3 combined Source 1 and Source 2 Wattle Point Wind Farm (WPWF) SA 91 MW May 2005 Source 25 years Source $180m Source Mt Millar Wind Farm (MTMILLAR) SA 70 MW December 2005 Source N/A $130m Source Cathedral Rocks Wind Farm (CATHROCK) SA 66 MW February 2007 Source 20 years + Source $160m Source 1 and Source 2 Notes with respect to the above: * Reported construction costs are assumed to be reported in AUD$, and are not adjusted for inflation at this point. ** WOOLNTH1 unit consists of two sites (Bluff Point and Studland Bay) completed in stages between 2004 and 2007. The TAS region was not connected to the NEM until 2005 upon the completion of Basslink. *** LKBONNY1 is one unit, and is not to be confused with Stage 2 and 3 of the project which were developed later between 2006 and 2010. Construction costs for Stage 1 are an estimation based on a capacity split of combined project costs. Technical Performance In my November article titled ‘Bigger or better: Are newer wind farms outperforming older ones?’ I looked at capacity factor for all wind farms, new and old, across the NEM. Capacity Factor as a metric relates most closely to revenue and market value. That article was well received – but a number of readers suggested that (because of increasing curtailment for network and economic reasons) that availability factor would be a more robust measure of technical performance for wind farms as it better encapsulates available wind conditions on site. For this analysis, however, we can’t use Availability Factor, as these seven wind farms have spent the vast majority of their lifetimes thus far as Non-Scheduled units, which: Do not participate in the central dispatch process; So do not publish any availability data. As Paul noted here recently , because of the increasing challenges of declining demand in the NEM, particularly the SA Region, several Non-Scheduled wind farms have begun operating as Semi-Scheduled units more recently. At this point, this has happened in two tranches: On 9th December 2021, some Non-Scheduled Wind Farms (e.g. Lake Bonney 1 and Wattle Point) started operating like Semi-Scheduled units. On 1st February 2022, three others (e.g. Cathedral Rocks, Mt Millar and Starfish Hill) also changed their mode of operations. It’s only from the time of those transitions that we have access to Availability for each dispatch interval, so could calculate availability factor – which is not enough history for the purpose of this article. For this reason, in the chart below I have trended monthly capacity factors for each of these wind farms. For context, I have also plotted the timeline of their schedule status along with the 12-month rolling average of their monthly capacity factor. Chart 1: Monthly capacity factors (bars) and 12-month rolling average (lines) for these seven units. Source: Generator Statistical Digest Note: Although these wind farms may have been connected earlier, publicly available market data only exists from January 2006 onwards. The graphic above is fairly data-rich, so, for ease of viewing, readers can view a higher-resolution version here . To examine and compare the long-term trends of each of these wind farms against one another I have extracted the 12-month rolling average figures and re-scaled the y-axis into the new chart below. Chart 2: Long-term 12-month rolling capacity factors for each of these seven units. Source: NEMreview Note: Since start of available data in January 2006. Not adjusted for inflation. I’ve highlighted Woolnorth (Green), Cathedral Rock (Orange), and Lake Bonney 1 (Yellow) as they show a pronounced slow but declining trend over the past four years. Also, a more recent declining trend for Challicum Hills (Faded Blue), Starfish Hill (Faded Red), Wattle Point (Faded Purple), and Mt Millar (Faded Brown) over the past two years. Declines over the past two years might be somewhat attributed to the change of schedule type (for those based in SA) as mentioned above. Marcelle Gannon, has previously examined the early changes in operations/behaviour of these units since the change . In addition to this, I will also note that all of these wind farms would have originally signed long-term ‘old style’ PPAs that did not have any contractual obligation to avoid negative prices – which have been accelerating in frequency . Some of these contracts may have expired or been re-negotiated in more recent years – although this would be commercial-in-confidence in any case. Commercial Performance As stated, it is expected that these seven wind farms would have been fully or almost-fully hedged under a relatively straightforward pass-through PPA for most of their existence. These wind farms will also have earned revenues for their LGCs as well – as we regularly cover in our GenInsights Quarterly Updates. As such, ‘black’ spot revenue returns will likely not directly reflect the actual revenues earned by the owners and operators of these generators. However, there is always some counterparty that is exposed to spot prices – so calculating spot revenue on a long-term basis does provide insight into the relative market value of these projects over their lifetime. In this first chart, we’ve simply trended the cumulative ‘black’ spot revenue earned by these projects over time and I will note: The somewhat different start points for the assets (albeit that these revenues are only calculated starting in January 2006); and More importantly, the different sizes of the assets. Chart 3: Cumulative ‘black’ spot revenue for each of these seven units since January 2006 (start of available data). Source: NEMreview Note: Since start of available data in January 2006. Not adjusted for inflation. To put these cumulative numbers in futher context, in Chart 4 below I have normalised these numbers against the reported construction costs and the capacity of each of those units. Chart 4: The reported construction costs minus the cumulative ‘black’ spot revenue, per megawatt of capacity, for each of these seven units. Note: Since start of available data in January 2006. Not adjusted for inflation. Source: Generator Statistical Digest Hopefully, this chart adds some colour to discussions about the market viability of these projects with the benefit of hindsight. But I would warn readers against drawing their own conclusions about a ‘return on investment’ as there is much deeper to dive (e.g. hedging positions, cost of debt, maintenance costs, FCAS costs, amounts received from any grants, LGC revenue, etc. etc.) – and this is almost impossible to estimate reliably from the outside, as much of this information is commercial-in-confidence. Further Reading The data used in this analysis has been sourced from our Generator Statistical Digest (GSD) data extract from successive years. For each generating unit in the NEM, the GSD provides detailed operational and financial performance statistics such as spot and FCAS revenue, bid volumes, marginal loss factors, price harvest, capacity factor range, etc. The image below shows the profile of Macarthur Wind Farm taken from last year’s edition . The next edition of our GSD (the GSD2023) is scheduled to be released early next month. We are progressively compiling more information about the GSD2023 here – and will, when it is released, also feature a number of pieces of analysis from different analysts focused on different aspects of the expanded GSD2023, similar to what we did for the release of the GSD2022 on 31 st January 2022 .

    "date": "10-01-2024 04:29:00 PM",
    "content": "From VIC to QLD to SA … I’d just posted this note (and some questions) about Stanwell Unit 1 , when the headline ‘Inverter burst into flames’ from RenewEconomy made me sit up at attention: The article’s open access on the RenewEconomy site, so everyone can read it there – but just want to copy in the following details: ‘The 39MW(DC) Mannum 2 solar farm was acquired by Epic Energy in August 2022 from Canadian Solar and is currently in the commissioning phase – not yet sending power to the grid – following the completion of construction last year.’ … ‘Mannum 2 sits alongside the original 6.8MW Mannum solar farm, which was developed and built by Canadian Solar in 2019 and bought by Epic Energy in November 2020.’ This article mentions the South Australia Country Fire Service, so I did a quick search and did find this update on Twitter from them: … which links through to the article ‘Mannum solar farm fire – 9 January 2024’ here : … which notes ‘a triple zero call at 9:45am’ (which I’ll assume was SA time … so 09:15 NEM time ). Given I already had it open following the STAN-1 article above, I changed the focus of the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget inside of ez2view to see what was visible for the MANNSF2 unit (i.e. which is, I believe, the DUID for the new unit) as follows: I’ve annotated a couple numbers in the image, and provide some comments below: 1) The Maximum Capacity of the unit is 29MW according to the AEMO data (a) remembering that Maximum Capacity is typically a better measure of Installed Capacity for Solar Farms . (b) but that would be AC, whereas RenewEconomy references the DC size (c) registration happened (i.e. when it first appears on the chart above) on Tuesday 12th December 2) From the middle of the day on 21st December the unit has been bidding 5MW into PASA Avail 3) Furthermore, the unit has been offering volume (up to 5MW) in various price ranges since 22nd December 2023 4) The RenewEconomy article says ‘not yet sending power to the grid’ … yet in the widget above we see (in the black line) actual output starting on Wednesday 3rd January 2024 (i.e. a week ago). 5) With the fire underway already at 09:15 NEM time yesterday, it’s also curious to see that after that point: (a) PASA Avail, and Volume offered in the bids, drops to 0MW from ~12:00 yesterday; but then (b) Curiously the output of the DUID (seen in Initial MW) ramps back up to 5MW about ~14:15 yesterday, and also again today. 6) Curiously as well, the rebid shown at the bottom of the Bid Table (received at the AEMO at 09:59, so too late for the 10:05 dispatch interval but used by NEMDE in the run for the 10:10 dispatch interval yesterday)… (a) Only included a rebid reason ‘availability adj due to testing’ and nothing about ‘fire’ ?, as we see in the ‘Bid Comparison’ widget in ez2view here: (b) Shifted volume out of the –$80/MWh (‘ negative LGC ’) price range and up to the bid band 10 (at the Market Price Cap ) i. The bid is capped at 5MW MaxAvail ii. At that time, the unit was set with MaxAvail = 5MW for the rest of the Market Day (c) We need to step forward to the next rebid to see that the MaxAvail was reduced to 0MW from the 12:00 dispatch interval: i. Not shown here, but this was received at 11:50 and used in the 12:00 dispatch interval ii. Still with a rebid reason ‘availability adj due to testing’ and nothing about ‘fire’ ?, (d) But, despite the zero volume offered , (as noted in (5) above) still showing actual output at 5MW later Tuesday afternoon and also today (Wed 10th January 2024).

    "title": "What’s been happening at Stanwell unit 1 since September 2023? (Part 1)",
    "date": "10-01-2024 03:11:00 PM",
    "content": "There are 44 coal units still operational in the NEM … and these units are continuing to supply a large share of the total volume of energy consumed in the NEM. Switching focus from VIC to QLD Yesterday I posted about some recent ‘Hiccups at Loy Yang A4’ . In today’s article we turn our attention further north to the Stanwell unit 1 (STAN-1 is the DUID), because there’s something that’s been happening there which has been the subject of an email chain that I have been tagged into: 1) Remembering that the Stanwell units are, historically, some of the better performing coal units across the broader fleet 2) However with respect to what’s been happening recently, I have more questions than answers at this point. Here’s a quick look back (via the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view ) to how the unit has been bidding into AEMO over the past 3 years : I’ve chosen to look back three years as there are, quite clearly, three distinct time ranges shown in this chart pertaining to this particular unit: Time Range #1 (until 15th July 2023) In the first time range we see a long * history of continuous operation that’s excellent for any unit. 1) Note that the chart above(*) starts at January 2021, but we actually need to go back to 5th August 2020 to see the last time when the unit was offline for a long outage (back then only ~ 2 week ‘minor’ outage). 2) Unless I have missed some minor outage or trip over that time range, I think this means that STAN-1 unit would have achieved 1,073 days of continuous operation through that period! That’s mighty impressive … I had thought there might be some news release about this long service period on the Stanwell news site (or in a media statement ), but I could not see it when I scanned. … the outage (below) was referenced in this note on 10th July 2023 and this note on 9th January 2024 . In terms of the bids over the time range, these naturally vary over that time in relation to a wide range of variables (inside the station and outside the station). But the three generic colour bands used in the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view makes it easy to see: Range #1 ) In BLUE = the volume offered at or below $0/MWh (a) including, in much of the time range above, down at the -$1,000/MWh Market Price Floor (b) to indicate that the unit would rather pay to generate rather than be dispatched off. Range #2 ) In GREEN = the volume offered between $0/MWh and $300/MWh the volume … being the traditional Short Run Marginal Cost bid ranges (units often use more than just one, and also tend to take into account shadow SRMC for the next-most-expensive generators, etc…) Range #3 ) In PINK and RED = above the $300/MWh ASX Cap trigger price, all the way up to the Market Price Cap (which has varied over that time range ). Time Range #2 (15th July 2023 to 14th Sept 2023) In the second period there’s no volume offered to the market … this was a planned outage, long known in advance. We can see this clearly in this snapshot from the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view , showing the MT PASA DUID Availability data filtered down just to the STAN-1 unit: Remember that you can use this widget to ‘ look up a vertical ’ and see ‘ that other dimension of time ’. As noted on the image, we can see each of the following: 1) this outage for STAN-1 was planned years in advance 2) there was some slight adjustments in timing (i.e. shifts horizontally) in the plan; and 3) the outage ended up being a bit longer than initially planned. … but all so far so good. Time Range #3 (14th Sept 2023 to NOW) Following from the outage, the unit was first back online on 14th September 2023. 1) Since that time, it’s been bidding ‘Fixed Load’ . 2) During this period: (a) The PASA Avail has been consistently bid at 365MW (which is the stations Registered Capacity – and remembering that this is a better measure of ‘Installed Capacity’ for many of the coal units ). (b) However over that period, the Bid MaxAvail has varied a bit, but commonly been 270MW (c) Even further below that, the Fixed Load bid has been most often at levels like 200MW, 180MW, 185MW. 3) A number of Daily Bids, starting on 15th September 2023, have Reasons like … (a) ‘fixed load required to manage HPBV pipework’ (b) ‘manage HP bypass pipework stress’ (c) ‘ HP bypass pipework fatigue ’ … or similar 4) Now my ‘real engineering’ knowledge is decades old and rusty, but: (a) I think HPBV stands for High Pressure Bypass Valve? (b) It’s not a part of the plant that is normally in use … which just leaves me with questions; and (c) I do specifically recall that concerns about fatigue (and creep) damage in high temperature/pressure components is of particular concern in any power stations that involve combustion and/or a steam cycle (it was the focus of my ES Cornwall scholarship in the 1990’s ). Perhaps some readers can help us understand more about what the situation is at Stanwell unit 1? An earlier time range (June to August 2019 and afterwards) Interestingly, looking back to the last major outage for the unit (June to August 2019), after the unit came back online there was also a period of running at Fixed Load : 1) which is shown here (via the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view in Time Travel), 2) but not further investigated: That’s all for now …",

    "title": "Hiccups at Loy Yang A4 (Part 1)",
    "date": "09-01-2024 12:06:00 PM",
    "content": "With one of our running copies of ez2view , we’ve coded ‘Notification’ rules to alert us via email each time a coal unit switches off. The theory is that most* of these units will run (at least at minimum load) whenever they are available … although : (a) As we noted at the end of 2022 via the GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2022 Q4 , ‘Unavailability of coal units hits 24% across calendar 2022’ . (b) And on top of this, we are increasingly seeing (*) cases, such as for YWPS2 here where higher cost coal units are placed in ‘Inactive Reserve’ or ‘Economic Outage’ status because of the ongoing growth of the rooftop PV juggernaut. In the past couple days we’ve received a few different email alerts relating to Loy Yang A unit 4 switching off a number of times … as I’ve quick summarised in the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget from ez2view here at the 11:30 dispatch interval, looking back 4 days: In this window, we can see that: 0) The unit had been on outage up until the afternoon of Saturday 6th January 2024, at which time it came back online; but 1) The unit tripped in the 09:15 dispatch interval ( NEM time ) Monday 8th January 2024 … not shown in the image, but the rebid reason references ‘safety valve issues’ . 2) The unit started coming back online at 12:20 … but again tripped in the 22:55 dispatch interval on Monday 8th January 2024: … this trip is shown in the table in the image above – but the surrounding rebid reasons don’t clearly nominate a particular reason for this trip. 3) The unit started coming back online at 02:30 this morning (Tue 9th Jan 2024) but has again just tripped in the 11:10 dispatch interval this morning … too soon for ‘Next Day Public’ bid data to be visible, and potentially indicate the reason for this third trip. Looking back 2 weeks Looking a little further back, via the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view at the 11:30 dispatch interval, we see that the unit outage shown at the start of the 4 day recent history above was also a forced outage : This forced outage (let’s call it #0) began on Friday 29th December 2023 and ended Sat 6th Jan 2024. Looking back 1 year Readers might recall that we’ve written before about how coal units ( any units involving complex processes, like a steam cycle) sometimes experience hiccups like these three trips coming back from an outage. Keeping this in mind, I opened GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q3 (our most recently published report, as we’ve only just started working on 2023 Q4 ) and flip to page 232/282 to look at what has been calculated as the 12 month performance for coal units from Q4 2022 to Q3 2023: In the 12 month period focused on in this report (from 2022 Q4 to 2023 Q3) we see that Loy Yang A4 experienced a run of good availability (i.e. 8,416 hours available and 344 hours on planned outage in December 2022) … which is in contrast to the past 2 week period. A gap for 2023 Q4 As noted above, the 12 month gantt chart spans from from 2022 Q4 to 2023 Q3 – and we’re only just starting to complete the analysis for GenInsights Quarterly Updates for 2023 Q4 ,. So there’s a gap in this analysis for most of Q4 2023. —————– A quick note about Callide C3 Unrelated to the above, but following from the article of 30th December 2023 , we note in the the ‘Generator Outages’ widget in ez2view that: 1) The expected return to service date for Callide C3 is still sitting at Wednesday 24th January 2024 2) Which is now only 15 days away! Speaking about Callide C3, I did see on the weekend Brendan Little’s update on LinkedIn about the roof going on at the repaired cooling tower: —————– PS1 … also noticed by Geoff Eldridge A little after this article was published I saw Geoff Eldridge also post about this via LinkedIn here:",

    "date": "08-01-2024 04:14:00 PM",
    "content": "On Thursday 21st December 2023 we saw that the CSIRO’s 2023-24 GenCost consultation draft was released …. but we’ve only been able to post about it now: (A) From the CSIRO … and the AEMO There’s a few different pieces of information at different sites, including the following: CSIRO’s draft 2023-24 GenCost Report Information on the AEMO website with respect to GenCost There’s information on the CSIRO website here : From that page, readers can download the (93-page) draft PDF : In parallel, the AEMO published more information about their 2024 Forecasting Assumptions Update Consultation here: … including a link to the CSIRO’s draft report. This followed only a couple days after the publication of the Draft 2024 ISP on Friday 15th December 2023. In this case in the AEMO Newsroom , there does not seem to have been a Media Release published … nor anything specifically on social media about these two releases. Over at the CSIRO, I did notice that: 1) There was this News Release published… 2) … and also that the organisation tweeted this : On their website, the AEMO notes here : ‘This draft 2024 Forecasting Assumptions Update uses the latest information available to update assumptions specifically relevant to the reliability assessment for the 2024 Electricity Statement of Opportunities (ESOO). The updates include (but are not limited to): (a) Updated Consumer Energy Resources, including Electric Vehicles (b) Draft 2023-24 GenCost report (CSIRO).’ The key points seems to be that (from an AEMO perspective) 1) Submissions are due to forecasting.planning@aemo.com.au by Friday 9 February 2024 ; and 2) Consumer advocates can register here to attend a joint verbal submission session from 3-4pm AEDT on Wednesday 7 February 2024 . 3) The final GenCost 2023-24 report will be released in the second quarter of 2024. (B) Media Headlines A quick scan of the main media outlets at that time, and since, reveals a number of articles: 1) In the AFR …: (a) Ben Potter wrote ‘Renewables are cheapest, even with poles, wires and batteries added in’ on the morning of the 21st December (b) At the end of the same day, someone wrote ‘CSIRO’s nuclear cost blowout a shallow analysis – O’Brien’ . 2) In the Australian …: (a) Patrick Commins wrote ‘Nuclear still most expensive energy, says CSIRO’ on 21st December 2023: (b) Nothing else? 3) In the Guardian: (a) Graham Readfearn wrote ‘Solar and on-shore wind provide cheapest electricity and nuclear most expensive, CSIRO analysis shows’ . (b) Then Amy Remeikis & Katharine Murphy wrote ‘Pro-nuclear MP says Labor weaponising CRISO report showing renewables are cheapest’ . 4) Via RenewEconomy: (a) Giles Parkinson wrote ‘CSIRO says wind and solar much cheaper than nuclear, even with added integration costs’ (b) Nothing else? 5) In the SMH / Age / Canberra Times: (a) Marion Rae wrote ‘Steeper cost of small reactors a blow to nuclear push’ . 6) On ABC: (a) Gareth Hutchins wrote ‘Nuclear energy is more expensive than renewables, CSIRO report finds’ . (b) Nothing else? 7) In PV Magazine: (a) On the same day, David Carroll wrote ‘GenCost confirms solar, wind remain cheapest forms of energy’ for PV Magazine Australia: (b) Nothing else? 8) In InDaily: (a) Marion Rae wrote ‘Cost update blasts nuclear out of energy mix’ : 9) In EcoGeneration: (a) A couple weeks later (on Thursday 4th January 2024), Zihan (Fred) Zhang wrote ‘GenCost reveals renewable’s future dominance in Australia’ for the magazine: … no doubt there are more that I’ve not come across, yet. (C) On social media Seeking not to fall into any particular rabbit hole, it’s worth flagging that I have seen quite a lot of commentary on social media in relation to several aspects of the GenCost process – including: 1) A fairly large amount of commentary from those who would seek to promote nuclear technology as a cost-effective means by which Australia might achieve sustainable emissions reductions; and also 2) Others commenting about the ways in which the CSIRO has (as they note as a Key Point in their Media Release ) ‘Pre-2030 integration costs now included’ … as a change in their prior process. 3) No doubt there are other particular threads as well. I could say something like ‘time permitting, would like to review the details of GenCost’ … but I know that, realistically, I won’t have time …",

    "title": "An initial review of Cohuna Solar Farm through 2023 – including bushfire effects (related to electrical equipment onsite?)",
    "date": "04-01-2024 03:12:00 PM",
    "content": "One of the news articles that jumped out at me in a review of what I’d missed in recent weeks was the article David Carroll had written on 22nd Dec 2023 ‘Cohuna solar plant resumes operations after Energy Safe shutdown’ for PV Magazine. Amongst the context provided in David’s article was the following: ‘Victoria government-owned (CORRECTION 1) agency Energy Safe Victoria (ESV) had directed Enel Green Power to cease generating power at the Cohuna Solar Farm after initial investigations into the fire raised concerns about specific equipment used at the solar farm . ESV, the technical regulator (CORRECTION 2) responsible for the safe generation, supply and use of electricity, gas and pipelines in Victoria, said the operator of the solar farm was on 8 December 2024 (CORRECTION 3) directed to disconnect equipment following a three-to-four-hectare grassfire at the 82ha site in November. Enel told pv magazine ESV had directed it to disconnect some equipment at the site but the plant has since resumed operations.’ Regarding the quote above from PV magazine, Energy Safe Victoria have contacted us to ask us to clarify that: Correction 1 = they are not government owned, rather an independent regulator; and Correction 2 = they are the safety regulator, not the technical regulator Correction 3 = also worth noting the direction from Energy Safe Victoria was on 8th December 2023, not 8th December 2024. — <SNIP> one initial line moved to PS2 below and updated/extended — So I thought I’d power up NEMreview v7 and have a look at daily stats for the COHUNASF1 unit through the 2023 year: For those with their own licence to the software, they can access their own copy of this query here . We can see several periods of outage (ranging from 1 day to several days) through calendar 2023, as follows: Outage in December 2023 … related to the electrical equipment (triggering bushfires?) The period pertaining to the Energy Safe Victoria notice above (i.e. offline during Friday 8th Dec and back online for Sunday 17th December at low load) is highlighted in the longer-term chart above. Curiosity drove me to find the news release from Energy Safe Victoria that says ‘ Energy Safe switches off solar farm over fire risk’ : … which says (amongst other things): ‘ On 8 December , the operator of the Cohuna Solar Farm at Horfield was directed to disconnect equipment after an eight-to-ten-acre grassfire at the site in November. After implementing short term safety measures, the solar farm recommenced operating at a reduced capacity on 17 December. … The operator of the solar farm is working to find a permanent solution to help ensure the issue does not happen again, while also working closely with Energy Safe to comply with the current direction.’ Noting the ESV media release states the direction was provided on Friday 8th December 2023 , but that it did not specifically mention a time at which this direction was provided, curiosity got the better of me – and I wondered what might be visible in the market data? Here’s a first snapshot from the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view looking back over the past 30 days (so including the period of the outage, but spanning before and after as well). However on a quick scan I can’t see any particular rebid reason that mentions ‘direction from Energy Safe Victoria’ or ‘electrical equipment offline’ or anything like that which might jump out at me as seeming related to the above? Flowing from changes to the Semi-Scheduled category that went live on 7th August 2023 (i.e. enabling MaxAvail as a way for participants to notify AEMO about physical limitations about the plant ) I wondered if this was what was used to inform the AEMO in a rebid on Friday 8th December to let them know of the changed availability status of the plant. So here’s a snapshot of the ‘Unit Dashboard’ widget in ez2view , time travelled back to 24:00 at the end of the day Friday 8th December 2023 and ‘zoomed in’ to just look back 24 hours from that point (i.e. spanning the day in which Energy Safe Victoria provided their direction to Cohuna): We can see a few things here, including: 1) There was some non-zero output from the plant earlier in the morning … up until the 10:05 dispatch interval. 2) Up until the 10:05 dispatch interval: (a) the volume had been bid down at –$1,000/MWh (i.e. the Market Price Floor) (b) but it had been only 21MW offered i. … somewhat less than the (27MW) Maximum Capacity for the unit ii. which had been the case for some days before then (c) this (reduced) 21MW volume offered had been further moderated downwards in each dispatch interval via the AEMO’s ASEFS forecast. << Hint – Readers here might like to re-read Linton’s note from 11th August 2023 ‘What inputs and processes determine a semi-scheduled unit’s availability’ and keep all of these different variables in mind with respect to this quick review >> (d) but the output is quite choppy early on in this summer morning … presumably because of intermittent cloud cover that’s reflected in ASEFS limitations. (e) For clarity: i. It does not appear that this unit was using a self-forecasting provider on this particular day (and pulling out the GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q3 I quickly scan Appendix 3 and see that the unit’s never used a self-forecast). ii. Nor , in my quick scan of the bids for this particular day, does it seem that the unit adjusts its MaxAvail at all through the period. 3) For each of the 10:15, 10:20 and 10:25 dispatch intervals, there are three sequential (and very similar) rebids that appear to have been manually lodged (i.e. the unit does not appear to use an auto-bidder): (a) The rebid reasons in these cases are that ‘ not economically viable to generate due to Forecast Regional Price and/or regional FCAS costs’ : i. which is understandable, given the negative prices at the time ii. but, still, not seeming to tell a story of a physical limitation on plant , or direction from Energy Safe Victoria ? iii. we’re seeking to understand more about the impact of changes to the market made through 2023, and wonder what are we missing here? (b) In these rebids: i. Volume for that particular dispatch interval was shifted to the bid band at $16,600/MWh at the RRN (i.e. the Market Price Cap currently); but ii. Non-zero volume was allocated there 4) Because these rebids were just changing the price band used for those particular dispatch intervals: (a) from 10:30 the price offered reverted down to –$1,000/MWh (b) there’s no subsequent rebid; (c) But ASEFS continues to reduce the Availability down to 0MW for dispatch. 5) Looking forward to the following day (i.e. the Trading Day for Sat 9th December 2023): (a) the Daily bid was submitted at 08:53 on Friday 8th December 2023; (b) but does not appear to have been superseded following the direction from Energy Safe Victoria (which we presume happened sometime after 08:53 on Friday 8th December 2023); (c) As such, it appears that AEMO sees the bid for Saturday 9th December 2023: i. As fully available in volume terms, physically; ii. But them subsequently revised down to 0MW availability by ASEFS. 6) Stepping forward to the next day (i.e. the the Trading Day for Sun 10th December 2023): (a) We see in the ‘Bids Comparison’ widget from ez2view that ez2view that the bids for this next day had volume removed : (b) These two bid stacks in the image above are ‘Daily Bids’ (i.e. and not rebids), so a rebid reason is not required – which is the reason I did not see anything that jumped out in the initial scan I noted above. 7) For the Daily Bid for Monday 11th December 2023: (a) 21MW of volume was allocated: i. i.e. reversing the case for Sunday 10th December; ii. but lower than the 27MW MaxCap for the plant (as had been the case before the direction from Energy Safe Victoria). (b) This was (in contrast to the initial offer for Saturday 9th December) offered up at the Market Price Cap (c) So then subsequently needing to be limited to 0MW availability via ASEFS. As noted above, the market’s changed a bit through 2023 – and we’re keen to ensure our ez2view software continues to provide a correct (and a comprehensive) picture of all of the moving parts relating to participation in the NEM … including for Semi-Scheduled units such as COHUNSF1 above. Hence, we’d really like to hear from any readers who spot errors , omissions, or points of confusion in the description above? 1) You might let us know in a comment below (if you’re happy for it to be publicly available); 2) Or give me a call, send an email, or contact via LinkedIn etc… Two outages in October 2023 (unrelated?) There’s also shown two outages (several days each) in October 2023 … but these have not been investigated further. Three outages in May & June 2023 (unrelated?) There’s also three earlier outages in mid 2023 (a day or two each) that are highlighted on the chart, plus a couple other periods of reduced output for less than a day. These have also not been investigated further. — End of initial article — PS1 (Thu 4th Jan 2024) … a new article at the Herald Sun No sooner had I published this article than I ran a quick Google query to see if there were any other articles out there that I missed … and I see that there’s an article from the Herald Sun titled ‘Further investigation into solar farm fire needed: regulator’ : Alas, I don’t have a subscription to the Herald Sun, either, so don’t know what it says… (and, as it stands, there’s no other more recent News Release at Energy Safe Victoria ). PS2 (Thu 4th Jan 2024) … other references from December updated after publication The November fire, and resulting direction from Energy Safe Victoria on 8th December 2023 was also reported elsewhere (around the same time as the article from PV Magazine), such as follows: 1) This was also reported on 21st Dec 2023 as ‘ Northern Victoria solar farm ordered to stop generating power after fire’ in the Stock & Land publication … but I don’t have a subscription so am unable to access and read. 2) On 3AW there was an interview with Energy Safe’s CEO Leanne Hughson at this address that has useful information … including that: (a) the bushfire that might have been triggered by the site was on Tue 21st November 2023 (b) there was a prior fire at this site ‘a couple years ago’ … i. Prompted by that revelation, I dug a bit further and landed at the ESV Annual Report for 2021-22 ; ii. On p30/132 I found the following description: ‘On 18 October 2021, three minor grass fires were reported at the farm that originated from the solar panel rotational control boxes . These boxes allow the solar panels to track the movement of the sun. We issued a direction to disconnect the tracker boxes as a result of initial investigations carried out after the fire. Further investigation uncovered other issues with the T4 connectors connecting the solar panels and with the T7 connectors connecting the fuse boxes to the direct current harness cables. We issued a second direction to stop the use of T4 connectors. This meant that the farm could not operate’ iii. Here’s that page of the Annual Report for 2021-22:",

    "date": "03-01-2024 03:10:00 PM",
    "content": "In December 2023, one of our clients* asked us whether we’d been keeping particular watch on the major outages that were planned by EnergyAustralia in response to the poor performance of the units seen through 2022 (one factor contributing to the 2022 Energy Crisis ). * they asked this during their briefing session for GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q3 , which was delivered by us at Global-Roam Pty Ltd (publishers of WattClarity) and our collaborative partners on those analytical assignments, Greenview Strategic Consulting . (A) Background It was way back (on 28th February 2023) that we posted the article ‘A quick look at EnergyAustralia’s outage plans for Yallourn Power Station ’ . However our answer to client’s question in December 2023 was that we’d not really been looking , since noting EnergyAustralia (and CLP’s) plans in that February article. (B) Current outage schedule Given it’s the start of 2024, and that two of these planned outages are still to be performed , I thought it would be useful to start of with this quick summary of the current status: Unit When is this Major Rectification outage scheduled to be performed? Performance – before and after YWPS1 Taking a look at the ‘MT PASA DUID Availability’ widget in ez2view today, focusing on Unit 1, we see that the unit has a major outage planned : (a) Starting 15th March 2024 (b) running 66 days (c) through until 20th May 2024. We’ll aim to keep an eye on this outage, and update readers here about its progress. Referencing Appendix 5 (focused on the coal units) of GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q3 ), we see: (a) the performance of YWPS1 over the focused 12 month period (i.e. Q4 2022 to Q3 2023) has featured a significant number of forced outages (shown in red) (b) but, conversely, no planned outages (which would have appeared in grey): So we’ll need to wait until the end of May 2024 to start watching for any improvement in performance with this unit. YWPS2 Using the same ez2view widget and clicking onto the next unit, we see only shorter outages planned into the next three years: (a) with the next one starting 19th April 2024; (b) but noting that these would not be long enough to complete major outage works. It turns out (as seen in the snapshot from the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view ) that the ‘Major Rectification’ outage for this unit was already conducted : (a) From 2nd Nov 2023; (b) To 19th Dec 2023 (c) Only 47 days … so shorter than for other units. … but that the unit subsequently came back offline shortly afterwards due to what appears to be ‘ID fan motor issue’ . So that was bit of a hiccup , back from a major ‘fix up the performance of the unit’ outage. However as Angela Macdonald-Smith noted in today’s article in the AFR (which references earlier WattClarity articles about the highs and lows of demand in the past week): ‘EnergyAustralia, which ramps down its Yallourn coal generator in the Latrobe Valley during periods of oversupply to minimise the hit from negative prices, elected to delay the restart of one unit there after scheduled maintenance because of the low demand, a spokesman said.’ We can see this in the ‘Generator Outages’ widget from in ez2view here, with the Unit State of ‘Inactive Reserve’ and a 2-day recall time : So we’ll watch with interest when the unit starts back up as summer kicks into swing. YWPS3 Taking a look at Unit 3 via the ‘MT PASA DUID Availability’ widget in ez2view today, we see that the unit only has Minor outages currently scheduled in the coming 3 years: The next one of these is currently slated to start on 16th February 2024. Flipping back to Appendix 5 (focused on the coal units) of GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q3 ), we see that much of Q3 2023 saw YWPS3 down for a longer planned outage : This outage: (a) Began 25th Aug 2023 (b) Ended 25th Oct 2023 (so well into Q4 2023) (c) So spanning 61 days . Since that time, we’ve seen the unit come offline three times: (a) On 15th November 2023 … perhaps a feed pump issue (b) On 28th November 2023 briefly … possibly a feed pump issue (c) On 21st December 2023 … due to a tube leak. … as seen in the snapshot from the ‘ Bids & Offers ’ widget in ez2view : So we’ll need to watch further into the future, to compare ‘before rectification outage’ with ‘after rectification outage’ . YWPS4 Taking a look at the ‘MT PASA DUID Availability’ widget in ez2view today, focusing on Unit 1, we see that the unit has a major outage planned : (a) Starting 24th August 2024 (b) running 55 days (c) through until 19th October 2024. We’ll aim to keep an eye on this outage, and update readers here about its progress. Flipping back to Appendix 5 (focused on the coal units) of GenInsights Quarterly Update for 2023 Q3 ), we see that the 12-month period shown (Q4 2022 to Q3 2023) contained better performance for YWPS4 than was the case for YWPS1: I would imagine that EnergyAustralia (and CLP as shareholder) still expects performance to be better following the upcoming major outage. This is something we’ll refer back to and update (with follow-on articles) later in the year…",

    "content": "The final day of 2023 was a notable one in the NEM – although depending on one’s viewpoint it may have been a firecracker or a damp squib. New Year’s Eve record lows There were a number of records set, including: Lowest-ever half-hourly operational demand levels for: South Australia , at -26 MW in the half hour ending 13:30 AEST (NEM time), down from the prior record of 5 MW on 1 October 2023, and the first time this particular demand measure has been negative. Victoria , at 1,564 MW in the half hour ending 13:00 AEST, 351 MW below the previous low of 1,915 MW recorded on 29 October 2023. Lowest-ever daily average spot price in Victoria at -$73.02/MWh, nearly $20/MWh below the previous daily low. This alone dropped the Victorian quarterly average spot price by nearly 4 per cent to $25.70/MWh. Prices in South Australia and Victoria sat near -$400/MWh throughout the middle of the day. High rooftop PV generation in both regions, almost all of which doesn’t receive or respond to market prices, squeezed out most other forms of generation in this period – including all large scale solar and most wind – other than around 80 MW of gas-fired generation required in South Australia for system strength, and around 2,100 MW of brown coal-fired generation from Victoria’s eight online units, which were forced down to levels likely to be close to their minimum stable output. Benign weather kept underlying consumption low, and while Victoria was able to export to Tasmania at maximum levels – around 450 MW – transfers to New South Wales were highly impacted by the Wagga-area constraints I wrote about a few weeks back . This drove the very low spot prices experienced south of the Murray. New Year’s Eve Puzzles – 1 Picking up on Paul’s series of on-the-day posts , there were a few puzzling features of the day’s events. AEMO’s Minimum System Load (MSL1) Market Notice issued at 10:47, alerted readers ( including Paul ) to “ an elevated risk of insufficient demand to maintain a secure operating state ”, that the forecast scheduled demand minimum was 1,300 MW , and that “ the secure [minimum system demand] threshold for the forecast operating conditions is 2,000 MW ”. This was accompanied by the statement that “AEMO is seeking a market response ”. I have no idea what kind of “market response” AEMO was hoping for through this notice. It’s conceivable that a few energy tragics like me were watching events unfold and might have turned on the dishwasher, baked a cake, or recharged the Tesla to take advantage of plentiful solar and the negative prices. Here’s an anonymised screenshot from social media showing how one retail customer on a spot price pass-through contract benefited from the very low spot prices (127 kWh imported! – this person must have a fleet of Teslas!) But I doubt even efforts like this would have added up in total to much of a “market response” – there simply isn’t enough demand-side flexibility at the moment to make a meaningful dent in minimum demand levels, Victoria has no pumped hydro loads, and large-scale batteries would usually have only very limited storage capability on top of their normal state of charge (evident in the “Battery load” series on the earlier generation mix chart, briefly spiking to over 400 MW but quickly dying away). Absent a meaningful market response, it’s not clear what else AEMO did about the risk of being unable to maintain a secure operating state in Victoria. Demand levels between 10:00 and 15:00 sat well below the 2,000 MW threshold specified in AEMO’s notice, but there were no further notices about directions or other actions taken. We can only speculate about the exact nature of the “insecure operating state” potentially brought on by low demand – one guess is that because of the benign underlying demand levels and very high levels of rooftop PV generation, the Victorian load blocks available for automated under-frequency load shedding (AUFLS) shrank in size. That would weaken this “last line of defence” against any very unlikely but high impact event (loss of multiple generators or transmission elements) that crashed the system frequency. Another possibility is difficulties with voltage control, which become more prominent at very low grid demand levels. It’s certainly possible that despite the market notice, the outturn conditions through the day were such that demand stayed high enough to avoid actual occurrence of an insecure operating state – otherwise we might have expected to see more notices from AEMO about actions taken. Finally, it’s also a bit strange that this market notice was the first and only one published about this potential issue leading up to the day. AEMO’s Short Term PASA forecasts for demand had been showing consistently the possibility of very low demand on New Year’s Eve – here’s an example of these forecasts nearly a week out, as at Christmas Day: New Year’s Eve Puzzles – 2 The other puzzle in yesterday’s data is one Paul has already pointed out , and highlighted a couple of charts above, namely that despite falling to a record low level, Victorian demand remained consistently above AEMO’s on-the-day forecasts, which predicted a minimum nearly 300 MW lower. I don’t really have any firm insights into this, but wonder if there were some behind-the-scenes actions which increased net system demand by lowering output from “small non-scheduled generators” (SNSG) embedded in the distribution system. A fair chunk of this generation comprises large commercial and industrial solar PV installations and mini solar farms ranging in size from 100 kW to just under 5 MW. They fall outside the smaller “rooftop PV” class for which AEMO publishes aggregated output estimates and forecasts, but remain below the threshold for registration as grid-scale generators, so there is no public visibility of actual or estimated output from this segment. On WattClarity, others have described this category as ‘medium solar’ . There are indications in AEMO’s longer term demand forecast data that this PV SNSG segment might be about 10% the size of the small rooftop PV segment, which was producing peak output of about 3,000 MW in Victoria yesterday. If that’s the case – and this is pure speculation – then full output from the SNSG segment would reduce Victorian grid (“scheduled”) demand by 300 MW. Reductions in SNSG output could therefore effectively raise grid demand. Perhaps there were such reductions in play yesterday, either as voluntary response to the extremely low spot price, or through actions taken by distribution companies on advice from AEMO? These reductions might not be reflected in the on-the-day scheduled demand forecast, which might partially explain why the lowest demand levels forecast didn’t actually eventuate. Hopefully the new year will provide some clearer explanations. ================================================================================================= About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.
