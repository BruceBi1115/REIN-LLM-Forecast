    "content": "I’ve been away on holidays (out of the country) for most of December so have not been paying too much notice to the electricity market, or electricity demand. The day I departed, we closed off our “Best Demand Forecaster” competition earlier than in other years, and have not yet had time to look through the entries we received (more on that later). Hence it’s been with interest that I found time today to power up NEM-Review for a quick look at how demand has been trending so far this summer: As noted in the chart above, I see how demand peaked above 30,000MW on Friday 18th December, meaning that this summer’s already seen higher demand than was the case for the whole of summer 2014-15 (we can also see how this compared to the 19th November, the other high point in the chart, which I already posted about here ). Given that I’ve done my dash of holidays already this season, I will be keeping an eye on what unfolds over the remainder of our extended summer period (through until 31st March 2016) for various reasons – including to see who wins themselves a BBQ on us. Happy Christmas, from all of the team at Global-Roam Pty Ltd . We’ll look forward to continuing to strive to make complexity understandable in the energy market through 2016.",

    "title": "What impact are Queensland LNG exports having on Queensland electricity markets?",
    "date": "18-12-2015 04:06:00 PM",
    "content": "Queensland LNG exports are now in full swing. At the time of writing (18 December) QCLNG has exported 79 LNG cargoes comprising 5.2 million tonnes (Mt) of LNG since the first cargo in January 2015. This has used 303 petajoules (PJ) of gas. The second QCLNG train commenced production in early July and the two plants are now operating at plateau production of around 8 Mt per annum (Mtpa) on an annualised basis. The second project, GLNG, started Train 1 production in October and has now shipped six cargoes. It is taking slightly longer to ramp up than QCLNG. First LNG from Train 2 is expected in second quarter 2016. The third project, APLNG, started LNG production on 11 December with the Magellan Spirit LNG carrier currently loading the first cargo. There is currently much focus on the impact of the Queensland LNG projects on the electricity market in Q1 2016, a time when Queensland power demand often peaks. The LNG projects affect the electricity market in two ways. To the extent that there is excess gas, this pushes down power prices and makes gas more competitive for power production (and vice versa). Also, the most of the new upstream gas processing plants are electrified, increasing electricity demand as production ramps up. Estimates of the likely increase in power demand vary but are generally assumed to be 400-500 MW now, increasing to a plateau of 1,000-1,200 MW. Figure 1 Source: AEMO At the macro level, the impact of the LNG projects on the gas price in the Brisbane short-term trading market so far has been moderate, suggesting that demand and supply are reasonably balanced. Figure 1 shows rolling thirty day average ex ante gas prices from the Brisbane STTM. The build-up of gas ahead of first LNG production at the end of 2015 reduced gas prices and there were spikes with the start-up of QCLNG Train 1 and Train 2. The start-up of GLNG and APLNG appears to have led to some market tightening, but not to the same extent as with QCLNG. Figure 2 Source: AEMO At least so far too, the start-up of the LNG projects does not appear to have been associated with a significant increase in Queensland power demand, which is running close to 2014 demand (Figure 2). If it has done so, there must be other offsetting factors at work. What about at the level of the individual LNG projects? As at 18 December the QCLNG pipeline is delivering 1,507 TJ, not too far short of its 1,530 TJ capacity. For the first two years QCLNG has the benefit of the APLNG equity share of gas from their joint fields, Kenya, Ruby Jo and Bellevue. Currently the total QCLNG pipeline nominations at 1,507 TJ are higher than production from its operated fields of 1,343 TJ, with the difference being met from storage or third party contracts so there is no sign that QCLNG has excess gas available. Berwyndale South and Kenya are not electrified but Ruby Jo, Bellevue, Jordan and Woleebee Creek are. The electrified plants are currently producing 1,095 TJ compared with total capacity of 1,625 TJ. Production from the QCLNG electrified plants will need to increase when the current gas supply contract from APLNG winds down around the end of 2016. The GLNG pipeline is delivering 596 TJ against capacity of 1,430 TJ. There is no sign that GLNG has excess gas. Fairview is producing 385 TJ gross and Roma only 16 TJ. The difference is coming from Moomba, storage and third party contracts. Fairview has capacity of 540 TJ/d, of which 410 TJ/d is electrified. As Fairview ramps up for Train 1 GLNG electricity demand will increase. The APLNG pipeline is delivering 400 TJ compared with capacity of 1,560 TJ but ramping up quickly, with a forecast of 690 TJ by next week. Current pipeline nominations are below production of 706 TJ from APLNG-operated fields. The difference appears to be being supplied to the other projects, plus meeting Origin’ domestic demand. The older APLNG plants, Spring Gully and Talinga, are not electrified but the Condabri, Combabula, Reedy Creek, Orana and Eurombah Creek are electrified. Currently the electrified plants are only producing 526 TJ out of capacity of 1,350 TJ. These plants have further to ramp up in supplying Train 1 but the significant increase is more likely around the middle of next year when Train 2 comes into operation. So, what if any, are the implications for Queensland electricity demand in Q1 2016? There will be some increase in power demand driven by the LNG plants, notably the ramp-up of Fairview to full capacity and the ramp-up of APLNG Train 1. However the more significant impacts are likely to be later next year as the GLNG and APLNG second trains start producing and in Q1 2017 when the two-year APLNG contract with QCLNG expires and QCLNG’s plants ramp up.

This enables generation payments to be made on a volume weighted basis, rather than a simple average dispatch price over the trading interval. Participants may choose to install 5-minute interval meters at their own cost. In recognition of the fact that not all loads are capable or willing to undertake rapid demand-side response, and not all loads have suitable metering or SCADA, the proposal provides for optional participation in five minute settlements for loads, which should also help to reduce implementation costs” … with our emphasis added. The Sun Metals application referred back to the NEMMCO process, which concluded with this final report in February 2003 .",

    "title": "Failure to satisfy the LRET – Prospects and Implications",
    "date": "27-11-2015 08:19:00 AM",
    "content": "Australia’s Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) enshrines in legislation for a growing amount of electricity to be provided from renewable sources each year until 2020, and then a flat-lined annual target of 33,000 GWh until 2030. (1) The target is measured in Large Scale Generation Certificates (LGC’s), with each LGC equal to 1 MWh of eligible renewable electricity generation. Wholesale buyers of electricity are liable for the obligation, by surrendering their required LGC amount to the Federal Government. The 2015 target is 18,850 GWh (equal to 18.85m LGC’s), with annual step ups in the target quantity applying until 2020. New capacity needed to achieve a growing target Published data from the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) indicates that eligible renewable generation for 2014 was approximately 18m LGC’s, of which approx. 1.5m LGC’s were voluntary surrender of certificates, typically associated with energy users committed to buying fully renewable electricity. Accordingly, approximately 16.5m LGC’s were created in 2014 for use in satisfying the LGC target. This means that substantial additional renewable generation above current annual output levels is required in order to achieve the 2020 target. On the basis that wind energy would provide the vast majority of the additional renewable output, it is estimated that between 5,000MW and 6,000MW of additional capacity will be required in order to deliver another ~16m LGC’s and thus achieve the 2020 target. This range assumes capacity factors on the additional renewable output of approximately 30-35%, which equates roughly to typical capacity factors achieved on many wind farm assets in Australia’s eastern states. The mix of new renewable investment between wind, solar and other sources will influence the overall capacity required to achieve the target, with solar PV capacity factors nearer to 20% and leading to lower overall capacity factors than if the future targets are achieved through wind energy alone. An illustration of the estimated new build requirement is shown below: How to deliver new renewable capacity of 5,000 to 6,000MW? A series of questions arise about the requirement to build 5,000MW to 6,000MW of new renewable capacity. The most obvious of these is whether or not the required additional renewables will be built when required. An additional question is to consider how this might occur. Initial glances at the historical growth in renewable generation shows that it has taken 15 years since the creation of the scheme to reach current renewable output levels around 18,000 GWh (as discussed above), and that a similar amount of new additional generation is now required within 5 years if the 2020 target is to be met. The necessary build rate between now and 2020 is around 1,000 MW to 1,200 MW each year over the 5 year period, to reach a 5,000MW to 6,000MW new build objective. Given the historical growth rate, this seems unlikely to be achieved. The legislation driving renewable energy uses a ‘carrot and stick’ approach to achieving higher renewable energy penetration. The ‘carrot’ is the value of the certificate (LGC) that is created for each MWh of eligible renewable generation, which provides the revenue boost necessary to make renewable generation competitive against Australia’s non-renewable generation (mostly coal-fired power plus a range of other sources). The ‘stick’ is the penalty price that is payable by liable parties (generally that’s electricity retailers) for any shortfall in the amount of certificates that they are required to surrender to the Federal Government each year, but are unable to do so. The penalty is a $65 fine for each certificate of shortfall, the payment of which is not tax deductible. This effectively means that Australia’s electricity retailers are able to pay up to ~$93 per LGC before being indifferent about either paying the penalty or buying the LGC. The development of new renewable energy projects generally require a viable business case and a supportive banking sector that can provide adequate debt funding to support capital expenditure. Banks seek strong confidence in the revenue streams available from new projects. For renewable projects, this means confidence in revenues from sale of both the wholesale electricity and the LGC’s. In the past, this has involved long term sales agreements with credit worthy buyers of the electricity and the LGC’s, underwriting project viability. Traditionally, new power generation has been financed by: a recognised need to address forecast electricity demand growth, and the elevated wholesale pricing that would arise if new generation was not provided into the system; and a long term commitment by buyers to purchase power from the new asset that underpins revenues from the new generation and thus ensures bank financing for the development In recent years, Australia has experienced higher levels of uncertainty in wholesale electricity (eg. solar panel penetration, demand growth flat-lining after many years of consistent growth, risks of carbon imposts, prospects of battery storage), and also higher levels of uncertainty in the pricing and the obligation level for renewable certificates, primarily due to the legislative uncertainty that has lingered over the RET scheme for many years. This has meant that demand growth is not occurring in a way that requires new generation, and various factors have shortened the outlook for wholesale buyers (retailers and large industrial users) of energy away from long term deals. In this market environment, how will future renewable projects proceed? In recent years, major retailers have not sought large scale increases in their long term renewable energy purchases, either for electricity or LGC’s, driven by the uncertainty noted above. Some retailers have noted their strategy of only covering the liability of small use customers with locked-in LGC purchases, leaving larger consumers to manage cost exposure on LGC obligations arising from their consumption. This leaves open a question as to how the LGC obligations associated with larger consumers will be satisfied. We have now reached a point whereby the number of years remaining before the RET Scheme concludes is 15 years. Each year that goes by before a project is built and brought into operation, means one less year for which LGC’s can be sold to support a project’s economics. This means higher LGC revenues (from higher LGC prices) are required each year until 2030 in order to deliver viable returns for each new project. Current LGC spot prices are over $70, and medium term LGC forward contracts are approaching $80. Surely at these prices, new projects would find ample opportunities for long term LGC and energy sales agreements would find sufficient revenue certainty to underwrite new projects? That depends on how long retailers and other liable parties believe that they might be obligated under the current set of rules in the scheme, and who might be willing to commit an adequate future LGC purchase price and term to ensure a bankable project. In the absence of firm longer term revenues for new renewable projects, an alternative is for equity funding of new projects, which would be expected to be at higher cost due to higher cost of capital associated with higher risk investment. Another prospect is for major industrial loads with LGC exposure to combine forces to drive their own joint development that secures LGC supply and avoids volatile LGC cost outcomes. Some recent support has come from state/territory Government-owned retail, which has led to committed projects feeding LGC’s to cover ACT liabilities, and Ergon (Qld) and Synergy (WA) recently announcing tenders/expressions of interest for accessing additional LGC’s. What happens if the scheme fails to deliver the renewable energy target volumes, LGC price defaults to the $93 effective penalty, and the scheme is redesigned or scrapped by a future Federal Government? Various questions arise from such an event, including how does this expose parties who have committed to long term LGC purchases? Options for the future What options might there be if the scheme requires change in order to achieve Government policy objectives on renewable energy rollout? One example is the UK experience, in which the Government acts as a market participant where required to buy Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) and enforce obligations on retailers to buy the Certificates from them. This provides a Government backed revenue stream for renewable projects that reduces financing costs due to credit quality and fixed pricing. It also involves Government price setting that may be prone to inefficiency relative to a market-based arrangement. Another scenario would be an extension to the RET Scheme, such that longer dated obligations on liable parties lead to greater confidence for buyers to purchase long-term LGC supplies. A third scenario is Government involvement in financially encouraging further closure of non-renewable generation, such that new renewable capacity address demand requirements rather than adding to existing oversupply of generation within the market. All these issues have diluted significance if the build rate ensures satisfaction of the 2020 target – but when does a Government decide that this will or will not be achieved (and then make further change)?……… About our Guest Author Andrew George is a former energy industry executive, who now manages energy advisory business Amanzi Consulting.

    "content": "LNG production is now a reality and will become a significant market feature, influencing both the gas and electricity landscape for the next 20 years and potentially well beyond. In December 2014, the first Queensland LNG cargo was shipped by QCLNG; GLNG shipped its first cargo in October 2015 and APLNG’s first cargo is expected later this year. The three committed LNG projects involve the development of six LNG trains on Curtis Island, North East of Queensland by the end of 2017/18, totalling ~25Mtpa of liquefaction/processing capacity. Figure 1.1 presents the profile of contracted LNG exports for each LNG project. There is a period between 2015 and 2019, where trains 1 and 2 of each project ramp up production to achieve an estimated plateau contracted volume of ~24Mtpa of LNG. Figure 1.1 Contracted LNG Exports | Mtpa Source: Core Energy Group, 2015 Once the LNG sector reaches maturity it will account for approximately 70% of gas consumption in eastern Australia and up to 20% of Queensland sent out electricity. Electricity Consumption in the LNG Value Chain The LNG value chain consists of four main segments, illustrated in Figure 1.2. The energy usage on each segment of the value chain is detailed in Table 1.1. Figure 1.2 LNG Value Chain Source: Singapore Power Group Table 1.1 LNG Value Chain & Energy Usage Upstream gas field and processing facilities is the major user of grid-electricity along the LNG value chain. As a rule of thumb, AEMO and Lewis Gray Advisory have assumed that electricity usage in the gas field and processing plant is on average 2.66% of total gas produced. This equates to just over 10,000MWh p.a. or ~38 PJ p.a. of ~1,450 PJ p.a. LNG gas production at the field, when all six trains reach contract-level production. Impact on Queensland Electricity Consumption Based on AEMO projections, electricity consumption in Queensland is expected to grow by almost 10,000GWh p.a. or ~20% by 2020 once all the LNG trains are fully commissioned.

    "date": "26-11-2015 06:58:00 AM",
    "content": "Given our focus on serving a broad client base in the energy sector, three particular rule change proposals at the AEMC have caught our attention all around the same time. All three have potential to significantly impact on the business of our clients (existing and potential new ones) in some way. This effect could be positive, or negative ( or mixed ). Unfortunately I don’t have a lot of spare time to think through the various implications (and overlaps) of the proposed changes being considered. As such, I only have some glimmers of suspicions – not fully formed ideas that I can articulate as clearly as I would like. Because of their potential significance, however, I thought it best to post them here in order to some of the thoughts aired below may not stand up to closer scrutiny – however we felt it better to air them here (and have them shot down) than to keep the thoughts to ourselves. We hope that the staff at the AEMC (who are employed to focus their attention on just such things) are able to take these into consideration. To all of our readers – please feel free to shoot them down (preferably with a clear explanation of what I’m currently missing). 1) The three rule change requests Request #1) Establishment of a “Negawatt Buy-back Mechanism” That’s not the official title of this rule change request , nor is it the proposed name for the new method. However I’ve taken to calling it that in order that I don’t add to the confusion the proposed new method is likely to generate (given that there are already a number of other methods for demand response that operate in the NEM). This is the oldest of the three in this bunch – it’s been bouncing around the traps for a number of years (having arisen as one piece of work flowing out of the “Power of Choice” review , stage 3 of which began way back in 2011). Submissions are due on this part by 10th December 2015 (two weeks away). I’ve previously commented, with respect to this method: (a) on how prices might be set , and (b) implications of the FERC ruling in the US. Request #2) Bidding in Good Faith On 13th November 2013 the Minister for Minerals Resources and Energy in South Australia submitted this rule change request to the AEMC, as a result of which this rule change process was initiated. Submissions were due by 29th October 2015 (though a late submission might still be accepted). Coincident with this process has been a number of claims of “price gouging” and so on in the media. In more general terms, energy users have expressed concern at the high level of forward prices seen for South Australia and Queensland into 2016. I posted comments here to follow a longer-term theme of the concerns of energy users . Request #3) Demand side obligations to bid into central dispatch This rule change proposal is the newest of the three – a consultation paper was published on 5th November to follow the proposal from Snowy Hydro on 10th June 2015. Submissions are due 3rd December (Thursday next week). My sense is that all three rule change requests are related – complimentary in some ways, but also conflicting. I’ve also been grappling with the possibility that these proposed changes are piecemeal solutions (bandaids) on a NEM framework: (a) that has an unresolved deficiency that’s delivering perverse outcomes; (b) that is being asked to cope with structural shortcomings, and (c) that looks set to be asked to make a massive transition for which it was not designed. 2) About the Demand Side, and about Demand Response We’re a keen supporter of Demand Response , as I previously noted here . Indeed, through 2015 we have been, as time has permitted, building up this reference site with the aim that it might grow to become a reference to all the different ways in which demand response functions in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM): www.DemandResponse.com.au (we’re very keen on your input , if you are involved in some form of demand response in any way, to ensure the site reflects the full range of possibilities). For readers that know us I hope I don’t need to reiterate – we strive to remain “technology agnostic” and hence view demand response as one more option of providing peaking capacity into the energy market (so I would hope we would not be labelled a “demand response zealot” for instance). Given our position in terms of how we support demand response in the NEM, these rule changes fall into: (a) An area of particular interest to us; and (b) Where our insights, in terms of how demand response actually functions (at least to the extent we are aware), might prove useful in this deliberation. Looking at the Snowy-proposed rule change (which is focused on the types of energy users we serve), I’m still trying to get my head around what the real problem is that this proposed change is trying to solve. 2a) What seems to be Snowy’s position? In essence, Snowy seems to be saying that, because they don’t know (because it’s confidential, currently) the way in which some particular energy users (but not all) procure their energy, they are unable to operate in the market as efficiently as they would like. 2b) Our experience of how Demand Response functions We help energy users operate with demand response in this particular way . For the avoidance of confusion, please note that there are a number of other categories of demand response which: (i) We currently provide less service in; and (ii) Which don’t seem to be the target for this particular rule change. In these other categories demand might change but, because it would not be in relation to spot prices, it would not seem that it would be covered under what Snowy intend? The energy users who we serve (in helping them physically manage the risk of high spot prices) are a diverse bunch. However there does seem to be two underlying commonalities that should be borne in mind with respect to these rule changes: (1) These energy users are in the business of widget-production , not electricity trading (despite the fact that electricity purchase cost represent a significant share of OPEX); and (2) These energy users are also operating in the manufacturing sector, oftentimes trade-exposed, feeling the stress of foreign competition and real stakeholders in the long-term decline of manufacturing as a share of GDP in Australia. With the energy users we serve, we provide a software service but will only occasionally be called in to help in developing operational processes for the site, in relation to the spot prices. Hence our view of how they operate might be incorrect in some ways (and certainly won’t be an accurate reflection in every case). It’s our understanding that these energy users might give some cursory attention to what’s shown in predispatch, but generally won’t pay it much heed as they see it as a feedback loop through which generators adjust their bidding strategies to maximise returns (as they are allowed – though constraints on this might change with the 2nd rule change proposal, advocated for by some of these energy users (amongst others)). Instead it is only within a trading period itself that a curtailment decision is made. 2c) What’s the data say? Given the way energy users actually operate (at least in my experience), I undertook to crunch some numbers to see what difference their curtailment might be making to actual levels of demand. Of course, to do this with 100% precision is impossible (because individual arrangements are confidential) but I believed it would be possible to observe some overall results from region-level data. The AEMO has recently published a document “Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model” that helpfully includes this diagram to explain the three main terms used for “Scheduled Demand”: We believe it follows, then, that comparing CLEAREDSUPPLY (i.e. the forecast/target demand number generated at the start of a dispatch interval) with INITIALSUPPLY (i.e. the actual demand number from the start of the next dispatch interval) will show how much demand has varied from what the AEMO expected over that 5-minute period. Unless I am misunderstanding something, what Snowy seems to be implying is that this “demand delta” will be higher when spot prices are above the trigger level – and that this higher delta is causing issues for them. The following is what I have been able to observe at this stage in crunching the numbers. As time permits I will seek to continue this analysis (please suggest how below) but, because of time constraints, it won’t be tomorrow when i get that done, unfortunately… (i) Observed “Demand Delta” in Queensland over almost 6 years Starting with the Queensland region, I retrieved dispatch data from 1st January 2010 to 17th November 2015 (when I performed the analysis). With the data, I compared the “Demand Delta” across 2 scenarios: (a) Price below a trigger price (i.e. assumed no demand response) (b) Price above a trigger price (i.e. assumed demand response to the extent that it exists, and is observable). Important, in this paradigm, are two assumptions: (a) That the INITIALSUPPLY ( forecast at the start of the DI) did not assume the demand response (which is what Snowy seem to imply) and that the CLEAREDSUPPLY ( measured at the end of the DI) does reflect this. (b) In our experience, different clients curtail at different prices at different times (and this depends on a range of parameters that we are not privy to). To provide a starting point, we assumed a trigger price of $300/MWh (being the cap payout price, and also an inflection point in a typical bid stack). The following chart resulted (click on any chart for full-screen view): As can be seen on the chart, the DIs in question (the light green line squished at the bottom) reflect the small number of DIs when the spot price was above $300/MWh over that five-year period. Following comment with Chris Deague (below) I have added a PS at the bottom in which I try to explain, more clearly, the method used. Note that I am still grappling with whether this method was appropriate, or not . Swapping that distribution to another axis, we see this 2nd chart: In this chart we do see that the green distribution is skewed a little to the left (i.e. fitting the logic that demand response to high prices means demand drops more than “normal”). But how significant is this difference? Here’s the same chart with the y1 axis set at the same scale: It’s pretty clear from this chart that there are have been many more instances over the 5-year period where the demand has been lower than AEMO forecast at the start of the DI (i.e. “Demand Delta” negative) . Hence I wonder if Snowy’s perceived issue is real, or moreso a representation of confirmation bias? Their hypothesis would have made more sense if the green distribution was skewed way over to the left. Instead, we see it (in the third chart) sitting neatly in the middle of the “all other DIs” distribution. In this way, if “demand delta” is a challenge (which I can understand it might be) it would seem logical to find a way of making dispatch targets more accurate across the board, rather than focusing on one particular scenario that operates a very small percentage of the time. Or am I missing something? (ii) Observed “Demand Delta” in NSW over almost 6 years Here’s the same version of the 2nd chart above for NSW: It’s been less volatile in NSW than in QLD over the course of the past 5 years, so perhaps that is a reason there’s almost no observable difference between the two distributions (on two different scales). (iii) Observed “Demand Delta” in Victoria over almost 6 years Again for Victoria we see the same sort of thing: The green distribution (on a much smaller scale) looks to be slightly broader than the “all other DIs” distribution. (iv) Observed “Demand Delta” in Tasmania over almost 6 years Here’s the same for Tasmania: Now here we can see a kink in the green (price > $300/MWh) distribution out to the left – but keep in mind, again, the grossly different scales shown. (v) Observed “Demand Delta” in South Australia over almost 6 years Finally here is South Australia – which has been (along with Queensland) one of the two most volatile regions over the period: In this case a bit more of an extended kink out to the left – which would seem to indicate a demand response to high prices. But keep in mind the different scales to conclude on its significance. What the above seems to show is that there is a normally occurring level of “demand delta” – and that the level of “demand delta” believed to be from price-responsive demand appears to be well within this normal level. Reminds me, a bit, of the story of the guy looking for what he’s lost under a streetlight (because it’s easier to see there) despite the fact that he lost them elsewhere… Am I missing something? Why single out: (a) these particular DIs (i.e. responding to price, but nothing else)? (b) only big manufacturing loads? Snowy says “it is self-evident that any load which is responsive to price has an impact on the price discovery process” . Whilst this might be true, is this not just a subset of saying that any demand change (whether triggered by price or for other reasons) has an impact on price? Perhaps it can be argued that these particular dispatch intervals are particularly important, given the outsized effect that price spikes have on average prices in the physical market. This is the same sort of argument that seems to have been made by proponents advocating for rule change #2 in the list above (in that case I wonder whether a similar type of phenomenon is at work – whereby once we develop a paradigm of “greedy generators” then anything other than bidding short-run marginal cost becomes “price gouging”). Or am I missing something there, as well? 2d) What other analysis might we perform My reading of the Snowy proposal is that it really revolves around 4 different time intervals – Time period 1 = within the dispatch interval (which I have tried to analyse above) Time period 2 = within the current trading period. This is relevant because of some of the bizarre outcomes that we’re seeing in the NEM because of the 5/30 issue (discussed more below). Depending on feedback below, I may try to look into this more in a future post. Time period 3 = further out into P30 predispatch. However on reflection I’m not sure this really makes sense (i.e. if demand response is observed within the same dispatch interval to be well within the normal bounds of “demand delta”, how much moreso would this be a day ahead, say, given all the vagaries of weather and what all the other 99.99% of the energy users will be doing?) Time period 4 = out into financial contract horizons (months and quarters). I’ve not had time to think through this in any detail, but would appreciate your comments below (please!) 3) Encouraging more unintended, perverse outcomes? In an ideal world it seems clear to me that all wholesale Market Customers would be required to bid to consume on a similar sort of basis to how generators bid to produce currently in the NEM. In this way, the organisation “most” responsible for the consumption would be required to nominate in advance for it – instead of the AEMO being saddled with that responsibility and then being bashed for getting it wrong. However that’s not been practical, at all, in the past. As technology improves, the barriers to this being possible should reduce (though changes like this seem to be heading in the other direction) – however our sense is that this is still some years away from being possible. 3a) The 5/30 issue At a forum conducted by the AEMC on the 2nd rule change above (bidding in good faith) a question was raised about the 5/30 issue – following from which one of our guest authors posted on WattClarity about the 5/30 issue . I do wonder about the extent to which two of these rule changes are seeking to address the perverse outcomes facilitated by the difference between dispatch and settlement timeframes. Part of me wonders why no-one has submitted a rule change to test whether NEMMCO’s conclusions from more than 10 years ago (that it did not stack up) are still relevant, given developments in big data, etc… 3b) What might be required (of more flexible demand) in future years? The NEM is faced with great uncertainty in terms of how the supply and demand mixes might be constituted in the future – because of technological change, because of the unresolved carbon/energy nexus, and for other reasons. There are certainly many who advocate a future consisting of a higher percentage of intermittent generation supply, coupled with copious amounts of storage and other forms of demand response. Whilst this is far from certain, and other futures might evolve, it perhaps might be instructive to wonder how Snowy’s proposed rule change might work in this environment? Snowy says “the situation is likely to get worse and result in further degradation of efficient price discover with better technology that enables more demand response, more distributed generation and more non-scheduled generation which will make scheduling of generation more difficult and uncertain” . I agree with these concerns – which is one of the reasons why I have invested time to perform analysis such as this for All Energy . However I do wonder whether a rule change that targets only loads more than 30MW is going to provide an ounce more transparency for any of these growing sources of demand flexibility. In one of the submissions I read to one of the rule change (apologies, they all blur together after a while – I think it was from RWE but would like to confirm later) I recall someone making a comment along the lines of how the way operations were evolving, it was like the NEM was valuing flexibility over technical efficiency . To me this does seem to be the case, and for what seems to be good reason, if this is already emerging as the future … 3c) Reducing spot-exposed demand, but increasing negawatts? The thought has occurred to me that, if all 3 rule changes were to proceed, it might prove easier (and less intrusive, in real time) for large energy users to opt out of the method they currently use and, instead, provide demand response through what I have called the “Negawatt Buyback Mechanism”. * if (and when?) the rule change to create the “Negawatt Buyback Mechanism” does go through, then we will be very keen to serve those energy users who choose to operate in that way, and maximise the benefits they derive from their participation. Under this mechanism, an energy user’s gross consumption (deemed profile) would not be published in the MMS and would only be available to directly related commercial parties sometime after the event. Instead a negative consumption would be all that would show in the MMS on a day-after basis – whilst we add into the mix an incentive on the part of these energy users to inflate their consumption profile leading into events when they are likely to be called on to dispatch negawatts, as some energy users have told us that they sometimes do when covered under this arrangement ). Rule change #1 and #3 do seem opposed. If both went through, would this outcome actually add to transparency – or reduce it? Especially if you have made it all the way to the bottom, I am very, very interested in your thoughts (but, coincidentally, am taking a few weeks leave so might be slower to respond than otherwise) Thanks, in advance, for your comments (below, via email, or in person)…. . PS (added Fri 27th Nov) about the method used for analysis Following Chris’ comment (and some questions asked offline) I have added this image here to help explain the method I used: Explaining the method I used in doing the analysis above Note that I’m trying to understand if the method I used is credible, or not -> it does seem to show a high number of DIs where AEMO’s dispatch targets are “off” by a significant amount. If it’s not credible, I would really like to understand why – hence please do add comments below, or email me direct , to continue this process though note I may be slow to respond as I am hours away froms starting a holiday",

    "title": "Price Response of Large Energy Users could Affect Peak Summer Demand",
    "date": "25-11-2015 12:18:00 PM",
    "content": "In a recent edition of Wattclarity, Panos Priftakis of esaa shows how the electricity demand varies with ambient temperature and what the impact of a heat wave does to demand . The cause of this increase in demand is related to the use of cooling by residences and in commercial operations such as offices, shops and shopping centres. The outcome of these increases in demand tend to drive much higher prices for electricity in the wholesale market and networks closer to their maximum capacities. In contrast, electricity demand by large energy users in the manufacturing sector varies much less because of their continuous operations; more importantly, their actions are more focused on reducing demand where possible because of financial pressures. Large electricity users are now being active in responding to the high prices seen in the electricity markets, especially in SA and Queensland. Market pressures and government action (in some cases inaction) are having a massive impact on the operations of larger energy using manufacturers and these have resulted in closures, downsizing and/or leading to little investment for new facilities. The drive for increased energy efficiency is impacting the manufacturing sector too. Overall, these actions are also impacting the expected peaks in electricity demand , but in the opposite direction to those referred to by Panos in his article. Without dwelling on the market pressures and government action/nonaction, large users are having to address the cost pressures imposed by the energy markets in a variety of ways. This recent report by McKinsey shows that energy is a considerable cost element for most larger energy users Large electricity consumers have seen massive increases in their electricity costs in recent years and two of the more significant cost increases seen were in NSW when network charges for large electricity users doubled as a result of the 2009 network revenue reset review. SA where wholesale prices increased massively in the 2008-2010 period. A similar step increase is being forecast for 2016-2018 after more moderate prices in recent years. If energy costs increase, large users have to find other sources of savings to offset the higher energy costs they are facing. Such methods include increasing productivity in all parts of the processes but, more generally, increased productivity is a must merely to maintain market share. So energy costs are still a core focus. There are three basic approaches used to keep energy costs under control. Buy cheaper . Options for this are addressed in more detail below Use less . In this, energy efficiency is the main driver and this is encouraged (enforced?) by governments such as through energy efficiency levies seen in Victoria (VEET) and NSW (ESS). These charges are levied on the energy usage and so provide an impetus to use less energy. The higher costs of energy and its delivery also drive the need to be more efficient in energy use. Find a different way to get the energy delivered . This can be achieved by finding lower costs for energy transport and/or accessing different forms of lower cost energy. While buying cheaper doesn’t necessarily reduce the peak energy demands seen in the markets (although certain actions can result in this outcome), the other two basic approaches have a significant impact on the peak demands seen over time. What is important to note is that the different approaches can have short term or long term outcomes for the peak demands seen in the market. Some examples of different approaches used to reduce energy costs in recent times are: Immediate impacts. This category includes actions that result in an immediate impact on the system demand Buy electricity on the spot market (either directly or via a retailer) and to load shed when prices rise as the prime tool to manage risk . While this approach used to be seen as a high risk strategy, firms are seeing that the rewards are significant and the risks can be managed, especially using the tools available to help manage this risk. Some large users can drop demand in a matter of minutes and even use the 5/30 dispatch/trading price separation to maximise the benefit of load shedding after a high price spike early in the trading period. Other users, with less ability to load shed quickly, look to the forecast prices to initiate controlled loading shedding. Some manufacturing processes are capable of quickly returning to productive operation but others less so. Overall, the losses in production are assessed to ensure that the savings exceed the cost of lost production through load shedding. This action is driven by the wholesale price of electricity, so unless the wholesale price rises, the load shedding does not occur. This means that such load shedding occurs mostly on working week days and not on weekends or holidays Some retail contracts include for a discounted supply price but with a requirement for load shedding, at the call of the retailer, usually because of expected high prices, but the timing and duration of load shedding can be uncertain. This problem of uncertainty as to the timing, duration and frequency of the call is concerning but to a degree this risk can be offset by requiring a notice period prior to the need to load shed. Third party aggregators offer a similar service. Load shedding at call is usually driven by the wholesale price, so no high price means no load shedding. Some networks offer a discounted transport price for load shedding at call. Again issues of notice and frequency are important for energy users, but commonly, the timing is related to expected loading on the networks which is usually well known some time ahead and related to weather conditions. This load shedding is not wholesale price driven, but there is an expectation of some correlation. All of these options provide an immediate response leading to a reduction in demand and the outcomes are seen in the regional demand that day Longer term impacts This category results in an overall reduction in the demand into the future, the timing of which might be measured in years Concern at forecast high prices for a considerable time ahead are addressed both by immediate actions (see above) and longer term solutions which might include closures and downsizing as well as a long term reduction. Outcomes from improving energy efficiency usually are seen incrementally but still impact the long term demand for electricity. Occasionally, large investments are made to build new processing plant which is more efficient than earlier models, with the older plant closed. An example of such a change in the paper industry is to provide more mechanical drying and less thermal drying, requiring more electrical energy and less thermal energy, but overall, less energy. Another approach is to introduce a more thermally efficient process – such as cogeneration or trigeneration. Such options require significant investment so careful balancing of capital costs and operating costs need to be assessed. These options tend to reduce the electrical load from the supply system but increase the need for thermal energy. One such process seen in recent times was the introduction of self electricity generation, using the high quality exhaust thermal energy for steam raising and the low quality thermal exhaust energy for drying. In this case, overall thermal efficiency rose from less than 50% to over 80% which provided a rationale for the capital investment. So there are many approaches used to reduce the costs of energy which impact the system demands for energy but the impacts on the electricity markets are varied. What is concerning is that whilst large energy users can see ways of addressing their energy costs and have the ability to devote time and effort to manage their costs, small users tend not to have the necessary knowledge or capital to be able to take appropriate actions and are essentially price takers. Commercial operators are less able to respond to immediate price signals (who wants to be in an office building or shopping centre unless it is cooled?) but do implement some of the longer term action plans to address their cost pressures. Editor’s Note This week we’re publishing a number of different perspectives of various factors contributing to what peak demand might be – NEM-wide, and for each region. Apart from being generally of interest (peak demand being a key driver of costs, in the energy market and on the network side) we’re providing another reason to be interested, this week.

    "title": "A meteorologist’s prognosis for peak demand for summer 2015-16",
    "date": "25-11-2015 06:16:00 AM",
    "content": "With a high benchmark already set this November for both New South Wales and NEM-wide demand , and as we head into summer during one of the strongest El Nino events in recorded history , it begs the question: What will peak demand look like for Summer 2015-16? I set out on a mission to see how well one can forecast peak demand based on how warm or cool the entire summer is expected to be. More specifically, I wanted to find out if the average temperature over several summer months could predict the magnitude of that same summer’s hottest days. The theory being: If it could, we could then predict this summer’s peak demand by applying MetraWeather’s seasonal forecast to the observed correlation. If we can extract the most likely hottest temperature that we expect to occur in each major city, then that gets us a large step closer to predicting state-by-state peak demand. First up, not all days are equal in the National Electricity Market. Hot temperatures will never illicit the same response in demand during weekends and holidays as they do during weekdays. To get around this, I decided to try and forecast the average of the Top 3 hottest days per location, as this proved the best benchmark for quickly quantifying the hottest “non-holiday weekday”. Secondly, to quantify the “average summer temperature”, I used every multi-month combination to establish which time period best correlated to the Top 3 hottest days per location. For example, locations along eastern Australia tended to lean toward the November-to-February average as the best predictor, whereas southern locations leaned toward time periods that centred within Q1, reflecting the tendency for extreme heat to fall later in the year for both Melbourne and Adelaide. Let’s see what we have: QUEENSLAND The key location used by MetraWeather for Queensland is Archerfield Airport , which sits near the approximate centre of Brisbane’s population distribution. However, Brisbane CBD proved a better predictor for extreme heat events. This is most likely due to the location’s much longer time series. The time period that best correlates to the Top 3 hottest summer days for South East Queensland is November to February. For the longer dataset of Brisbane CBD, a pattern appears such that for every degree warmer the November-to-February time period is, the hottest day is expected to be 1.3 degrees warmer. Applying MetraWeather’s latest seasonal forecast, we get a corresponding value of about 37C as the most likely average of this summer’s Top 3 heat events for both Archerfield and Brisbane CBD. In other words, the top “non-holiday weekday” temperature is most likely to be about 37 degrees across Brisbane, about a degree higher than average . It should also be implied that this scenario occurs similarly to other 37-degree events, where a sea-breeze would be late to occur. NEW SOUTH WALES If there’s any city looking to bear the brunt of heat waves this year, it is Sydney. While Brisbane is not far behind in this heat forecast, it is Sydney that has been more persistently targeted by seasonal weather models for above-normal temperatures . Recent seasonal forecasts have backed off a bit from the expectations of a very hot summer for Sydney and Brisbane, but remain firmly on the warm side of the spectrum. Using the same correlation method, this time using Bankstown and Observatory Hill , we can extract a Top 3 extreme heat forecast of 40C and 38C respectively. In other words, we can likely expect at least one more extreme heat day for Sydney of near-equal magnitude to the November 20 event, later on in the summer. Using a dataset that spans as far back as the 1850s does bring up the valid argument of how relevant these forecasts are when applying it to 21 st century summers. However, this relationship would only break down if the correlation between the overall summer average and the magnitude of extreme heat days have altered over the last 150 years in Australia. I will leave this as an open-ended thought. VICTORIA Melbourne is not expected to be much above or below normal this summer when compared to the standard 30-year climatology of 1981-2010. However, when compared to the full 160-year record of Melbourne Regional Office , the summer forecast is an above-normal one. Unlike Brisbane and Sydney, the correlation is highest when defining summer exclusively as January to February. The most likely peak temperature appears to be about 39 or 40 degrees, but this is for the now-defunct Regional Office site. In the two summers where Melbourne Regional Office and Melbourne Olympic Park were running concurrently, it was clear that the new Olympic Park site is often a half degree to full degree cooler than its Regional Office counterpart during extreme heat events. Thus, it is expected that peak demand in Victoria is best based on Melbourne Olympic Park reaching 39C (during a non-holiday weekday). SOUTH AUSTRALIA It can be argued that it is not as safe an assumption to predict peak demand in South Australia based solely on extreme heat, as renewable energy’s role is much larger than in any other state. However, the correlation between the hot summers and the hottest individual days is fairly strong. Adelaide’s definition of “summer” seems best when using December to March, as this gives the highest correlation to extreme heat (and thus, to an extent, peak demand). Similar to Melbourne, the likelihood of this summer’s overall temperatures being above average is only slightly more than them being below average. The latest MetraWeather seasonal forecast for Adelaide Kent Town would translate to a 40-degree day as the most likely hottest day, and thus the best Tmax value to assume when translating temperatures into a peak demand forecast. CONCLUSION This quick study into the ability to predict the hottest days, simply from looking at how hot the summer is expected to be overall, shows that while it’s not a strong correlation in most instances, it is significant enough to appreciate . From a probabilistic standpoint, the net still needs to be cast wide in order to catch the full range of possible outcomes. But about half of the climatological range can be either eliminated or significantly reduced in likelihood. And when it comes to predicting peak demand (and winning a BBQ!), that ain’t half bad.

    "title": "What factors will contribute to peak demand over summer 2015-2016?",
    "date": "24-11-2015 07:57:00 AM",
    "content": "Summer in Australia has become the traditional period of peak demand for electricity. The main reason for this is the increased use of air conditioners over the past two decades. Three out of every four Australian household currently has a refrigerated air conditioner or an evaporative cooler. This is almost double the rate of ownership back in the late 1990s . The main exception is Tasmania with its cooler winters and milder summers. The cumulative effect of all these air conditioners working hard at the same time translates into big surges in electricity demand as households and businesses stay cool. With the Bureau of Meteorology forecasting the current El Nino to be significant with some major heatwave events, peak demand is expected to occur during summer. But do high temperatures still lead to ever higher peak demand, particularly when we consider other factors, such as industrial demand and the growth of rooftop PV which have had an impact on demand levels? What is the impact on electricity demand of several extremely hot days in a row? Demand for electricity increases and decreases significantly at different times every day of every week. The normal daily ‘peaks’ of electricity demand come at breakfast and dinner times, with demand falling to very low levels overnight and being low on weekends and during holiday periods. Record peaks on mainland Australia typically occur in summer on weekday afternoons and are caused by increased residential and commercial air conditioner use over and above ongoing industrial load. The most intense recent heatwaves – periods of extended high temperatures – across Australia have occurred in South Australia and Victoria. In January 2009 a four-day heat wave with maximum temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius set new demand records in both states. These records were nearly matched in a similarly intense heat wave in January 2014. The cumulative heat that builds up with consecutive days of very high temperatures increases air conditioner use and significantly drives up demand for electricity. How hard an air conditioner is working is directly related to the temperature outside. So it is no surprise that heatwaves lead to large spikes in electricity demand. Looking at the data from heatwaves dating back to 2009, we have noticed that peak electricity demand tends to increase slightly every consecutive day during a major heat wave. This makes sense, as buildings tend to accumulate heat, and air conditioners need to work progressively harder each day to achieve the same temperatures. For example, looking at two separate peak demand periods in South Australia and Victoria over the heatwaves in 2009 and 2014, we can see the demand increase both with the temperature rising and the duration of the heatwave. Figure 1: Victorian Peak demand and temperature, 25-30th of January, 2009 Figure 2: South Australian Peak demand and temperature, 25-29th of January, 2009 Figure 3: Victorian Peak demand and temperature, 25-29th of January, 2014 Figure 4: South Australian Peak demand and temperature, 12-17th of January, 2014 What is driving this increased electricity demand? The number one driver of increased electricity demand during heatwaves is air conditioners. Household air conditioners were once a luxury. Now, they are a standard appliance in most Australian homes. In 1999, only 35 per cent of Australian households owned an air conditioner. Today, around 74 per cent of all homes have at least one air conditioner and an increasing proportion of households now have multiple units. In 2011, nearly 600,000 households had three or more units . That’s more than 9.2 million installed air conditioners, more than three times as many as in 1995. Figure 5 shows the proportion of Australian households with air conditioners increasing over time. Figure 5: Proportion of Australian Households with air conditioners 1990-2014 Having these air conditioners turned on simultaneously puts a huge strain on our electricity networks. Around 25 per cent of all investment by network companies has been to build extra capacity into the grid for these handful of very hot days each year. When is the next heatwave expected? The short answer is: This summer . Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) recently warned the current El Nino event is expected to be significant and continue well into next year . The BOM is expecting on average higher maximum temperatures as a result of the El Nino. Melbourne had its hottest maximum early in October, with 34.4 degrees, only to set a new mark just a day later with 35.8 degrees. In its media release on November 10, the BOM has predicted warmer than average maximums over much of south-western and eastern Australia. Figure 6 shows that the capital cities (which are the major load centres for electricity) most likely to experience above median maximum temperature are Sydney and Perth (75 per cent) followed by Brisbane and Adelaide (60 per cent). Figure 6: Temperature – The chance of above median maximum temperature for November to January How does solar PV impact demand during heatwaves? The amount of electricity generated by solar systems has increased significantly since 2006. Generous up-front subsidies and feed-in tariffs have acted as catalysts to the sharp rise in the uptake of solar panels. The latest figures from the Clean Energy Regulator show that we now have almost 4,000 MW of solar capacity across Australia. To put this into perspective, the largest power station in Australia is Eraring power station in NSW at 2,780 MW, although Eraring’s annual output still exceeds solar output due to its higher capacity factor. With rooftop solar systems behind the meter, it’s only possible to estimate how much they are generating (as some of the electricity generated is used directly by the household). During the 2014 heatwave solar generation was estimated to account for 4.5 per cent of generation during the time of peak demand in SA and 2.4 per cent in Victoria . In both cases, this represented under 50 per cent of installed capacity. This means total peak electricity demand in both states was almost certainly significantly higher in January 2014 than the all-time record, but the effect of increased penetration of solar was to keep demand below the levels of demand set in 2009. South Australia boasts the highest penetration rate of solar panels in Australia; a quarter of SA homes now have solar. The recent increase in solar panel installations continues to decrease demand during daylight hours. This has the effect of pushing the peak demand time deeper into the evening (as the sun sets, solar systems reduce output). The 2013-14 peak demand in South Australia occurred at 7 PM. In Queensland, despite solar PV connections continuing to grow more slowly, peak demand is occurring in the early evening. Energex anticipates that the summer peak demand will occur at 6.30 pm by about 2020 . Significant changes in industrial demand The chances of NSW and Victoria breaking any electricity demand records have diminished in the last few years. Total demand for electricity has reduced since 2009, primarily as a result of falling industrial demand from the closure of large industrial facilities like aluminium smelters, steel production and car factories. The closure of the Kurri Kurri aluminium smelter in NSW caused a sharp decline in large industrial consumption from 2011- 2012 to 2012-2013, while the closure of the Point Henry aluminium smelter in Victoria partly led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant after it supplied about 40 per cent of the power for Point Henry aluminium smelter . In contrast, LNG projects coming online and CSG extraction are progressively adding more to Queensland’s base demand. According to the 2015 AEMO National Electricity Forecasting report (NEFR) LNG projects reach operational capacity in 2017-18 and as a result their consumption plateaus in the medium-term . Underlying population growth There are other underlying factors such as population growth that could also have an impact. In the 2015 NEFR forecasts shows that population growth is a key driver for any increase in consumption across residential and commercial customers. According to the ABS, the population across NEM states has been increasing at an average of 1.1 per cent . Where to now? On 20 November 2015, Sydney experienced its second hottest November day on record with temperatures reaching 40.9 Celsius at 3:05pm, as a heatwave hit much of NSW following three consecutive days over 30 degrees . Demand on that day reached 12,667 MW which is highest demand for the 2015 calendar year and current peak demand for 2015-16 . Queensland appears more likely though to reach a peak demand record than any other state. Last summer, Queensland had a network peak record for a Saturday . Demand reached 8,300 MW, which was only 600MW short of the all-time record for working weekdays. To the extent this indicates some underlying peak demand growth, plus the contribution of the CSG to LNG industry, a run of a few hot weekdays in Brisbane could result in a new record.

    "content": "It’s been said that Australian business starts winding down on Melbourne cup day (that’s today), and does not really return until Australia day – making it one (very) long “silly season”. If you’ve been distracted – and then disappointed – by the horses today, can we suggest a better chance to win yourself this Beefeater 47652 Discovery 1000R 5-Burner BBQ currently priced at $1,079 at Appliances Online : Those who have been readers of WattClarity for some time will recognise our summer give-away , which has been running for 10 years , now (prior winners of the main competition are listed below). It’s one of the ways we like to say thanks to the many energy-sector stakeholders we have interacted with over many years + to provide a light-hearted way to focus on one of the most important metrics in the market/sector. Seven Separate Competitions Given it’s popularity, we’ll continue what we started in summer 2014-15 by inviting you to send in your estimates for one (or more) of the following 7 parameters: What you need to estimate (for Extended Summer*) Entries & Prizes Comp #1 Peak NEM-Wide Dispatch Demand Target The NEM is a national market, much of the time, so NEM-Wide demand (on a dispatch target basis) is a metric to keep track of. For those who really do need the details, we calculate this on AEMO’s InfoServer as follows: select top 1 * from (select SUM(TotalDemand) as Demand, SettlementDate from DispatchRegionSum where INTERVENTION = 0 group by SettlementDate) q order by Demand desc You can find this in your copy of NEM-Watch here . Summer 2014-15 saw that the NEM-wide demand was the lowest in more than 10 years ! What will it be for summer 2015-16? You only get one shot at the big prize (above) – so make it a good one! Comp #2 Peak QLD Region Dispatch Demand Target With the NEM-wide trend of declining demand coming head-to-head with the emergence of upstream compression of gas supplies for LNG, summer 2014-15 proved to be very interesting (with a new all-time record almost set ). We expect that summer’s peak in QLD for 2015-16 will be higher still – given the growth in upstream compression that’s occurred across the year. But how high will it be? You can enter once each day – hence that means a maximum of 25 entries per person over the period.Nail this one, and you get one of 6 Consolation Prizes Comp #3 Peak NSW Region Dispatch Demand Target Unlike the case for QLD, peak demand in NSW proved to be quite lacklustre . What will be the case for summer 2015-16? You can enter once each day – hence that means a maximum of 25 entries per person over the period.Nail this one, and you get one of 6 Consolation Prizes Comp #4 Peak VIC Region Dispatch Demand Target Summer 2014-15 failed to arrive in Victoria (at least with respect to electricity demand). The peak demand was lower by 1600MW . We’ll be very interested to see what happens in summer 2015-16. You can enter once each day – hence that means a maximum of 25 entries per person over the period.Nail this one, and you get one of 6 Consolation Prizes Comp #5 Peak SA Region Dispatch Demand Target South Australia is, by its nature, a very peaky region. Peak demand is very dependent on high temperatures arriving and we found that peak demand in summer 2014-15 was a fizzer . What will it be for summer 2015-16? You can enter once each day – hence that means a maximum of 25 entries per person over the period.Nail this one, and you get one of 6 Consolation Prizes Comp #6 Peak TAS Region Dispatch Demand Target As some of our more astute (and local Tasmanian) forecasters in summer 2014-15 noted, peak “summer” demand actually came with colder weather in the March period we tacked onto our definition of summer for 2014-15. Will it also be the case for summer 2015-16? You can enter once each day – hence that means a maximum of 25 entries per person over the period.Nail this one, and you get one of 6 Consolation Prizes Comp #7 Peak Aggregate 5-min Metered Wind Production Wind production is growing in the NEM (as is the audience for people watching it spin in real time in our NEM-Watch Widget , which we developed for readers of RenewEconomy). It was not really a surprise, then, that wind peak production in summer 2014-15 was higher than in previous summers . What will it be for summer 2015-16? You can enter once each day – hence that means a maximum of 25 entries per person over the period.Nail this one, and you get one of 6 Consolation Prizes If you prove yourself to be the “best in the NEM” at forecasting one of the above metrics, then we’ll have you enjoying your own new BBQ shortly after summer’s ended: Get your entries in (starting today) to earn bragging rights, by out-scoring your colleagues & your competitors! The Prize(s) We have 7 competitions running this summer, so we need 7 prizes (plus an extra one) … The Main Prize – A Beautiful BBQ You only have only one entry in Competition 1 , so make it count – if you’re closest to the mark (forecasting peak NEM-Wide Demand), we’ll crown you “Best Forecaster in the NEM for Summer 2015-16” and provide you the prize shown at the top of the page. I’m sure you’ll agree that this is a wonderful prize, and it’s open to everyone who enters (subject to the fine print below)… … but wait, there’s more… We’d like to extend a special thank-you to all of our clients , for entrusting us to serve them. If your single entry is closest to the mark come the end of summer, and you work for a company that’s currently a valued client of ours , then I think we’ll manage to rustle up a nice bottle of Grange to wash the first snags down with! Specific vintage will depend on what we find when we go shopping closer to the end of the competition. 6 Consolation Prizes – A very handy portable BBQ You can enter as many as one time each day for Competitions 2 to 7 – subject to the fine print below. Your best entry (which may not be your first) will be compared against all others for that competition and the best entry (for that competition) will win this handy little worker: To be clear, we are giving away 6 of these little babies as prizes… It’s the “Weber Baby Q 50060224 Q1000 BBQ” from Appliances Online (current price $305). Not a bad consolation prize (especially 6 of them), I hope you will agree, and available to all (again subject to the fine print below)… To Enter Email us ( summer@global-roam.com ) with your Forecast(s)*, remembering to be clear about which competition you entry is relevant to (if you don’t do this we’ll have a guess, but don’t hold it against us if we misinterpret). * Forecast, or W.A.G! Your entry needs to come from a valid business email address (no GMail or Hotmail etc) and include a valid mobile number – so we can contact you to arrange delivery when you win (fingers and toes crossed for you). Remember that it’s one entry only for Competition #1 (and the chance at the Major Prize) but that it’s as much as one entry each day for each of the other 6 Competitions, giving you a good chance of being in with a shake of winning one (or more) of the pretty reasonable Consolation Prizes. The Fine Print (a.k.a. suggested reading for those who are really keen!) 1) Entry is open to anyone who works in, or around, Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM), except for employees, shareholders and other general hangers-on of GLOBAL-ROAM Pty Ltd: 1a) We will be particularly supportive of employees in organisations that are clients of ours (email us with questions, and we’ll be more likely to point you at references that might help you with your guesstimate, for instance) 1b) We reserve the right to “lose” entries from companies we deem as competitors to us (can’t have them enjoying a new BBQ on us, can we!) 2) To be a valid entry : 2a) Your entry must be received on or between Tuesday 3rd November 2015 and Friday 27th November 2015 (NEM time) . 2b) Your entries must be emailed to summer@global-roam.com . 2c) Your entry must contain your estimate of one (or more) of the following: Comp # 1 = peak NEM-Wide Demand this Extended Summer* (only one entry) Comp # 2 = peak QLD Demand this Extended Summer* Comp # 3 = peak NSW Demand this Extended Summer* Comp # 4 = peak VIC Demand this Extended Summer* Comp # 5 = peak SA Demand this Extended Summer* Comp # 6 = peak TAS Demand this Extended Summer* Comp # 7 = peak Aggregate Wind Farm Output this Extended Summer* This year we’re using an extended definition of “Summer” to incorporate all of Q1 – hence from 1st December 2015 to 31st March 2016 . 2d) Your entry must be from a valid work email address , and contain your mobile number (on which we can contact you to arrange for delivery). 2e) If you feel exceptionally lucky (or think you’re a good forecaster) you can also tell us where to have the BBQ delivered. You don’t need to tell us which it is (i.e. if you’re just lucky, or if you think you are an exceptional forecaster)! 3) Each of the 7 competitions will be judged independently (i.e. you could, if you are exceptionally good – or just plain lucky) win all 7 BBQ. I’m sure you’ll have enough “friends” to make your job difficult in handing them all out! 4) The winner will be notified directly soon after the end of Summer, and the winner’s name will also be published on the WattClarity ® site . 4a) Delivery of the BBQ will be organised to a location within the standard delivery area of Appliances Online. 4b) If they are out of that particular stock, we’ll arrange a similar model for you – at around the same price (happy to take your suggestions on that). 4c) If the pricing of the prize differs massively from what’s indicated above, we reserve the right to substitute something similar at around the same price. We would, of course, work with you to ensure it was something that you were happy to receive! 5) If more than one entry is identical (and all are closest to the mark) we’ll take one from a current client, first (and if there is more than one then we’ll take the first one we’ve received). 6) The decision of the judges (global-roam Pty Ltd) is final and no correspondence will be entered into. You could try to bribe them, but that won’t work (though they might be able to save up to have their own holiday next summer). You could try to get in their “good books” by purchasing lots of NEM-Watch (or by referring NEM-Watch to those poor unfortunate souls who don’t yet have their own copies) – but, whilst that would make them happy, it will not get you closer to being declared the winner (though you will have a pretty good view of what the demand is, all summer!) Suggested Reading On WattClarity , you might find the following context useful in determining your entry. We’ll be adding more in the coming weeks, so keep an eye on the site. 1) Over-arching this competition, and all forecasts for demand (which underlie a number of investment planning decisions), is the question about where demand is headed into the future. To answer that question, one must first understand how demand has been changing in the NEM , and some of the many factors contributing to the current trend of decline . 2) Our prior year competition entries will also factor into your estimate for this summer: Last summer (2014-15) we saw the NEM-wide demand “peak” (if that was the word for it) below 30,000MW – and energy-sector lawyer Connor James won himself a BBQ . Back in summer (2013-14) we saw the NEM-wide demand peak at 33,223MW and an AEMO staff member (Magnus Hindsberger) use a very scientific process to ensure he was within 0.26% of the mark). Highly recommended reading is Magnus’ comment at the bottom of that article, where he explains some of his method. During summer 2012-13 Joy Chan (of Delta) just scraped past other colleagues at Delta, and the rest of the entrants, with an entry just shy of the mark – in a summer where the peak demand crept close to 32,000MW. Summer was lacklustre in 2011-12 , but the competition still sparkled, and Aden Fanning (of InterGen) was awarded the BBQ and the kudos for a 12 month period. Summer 2010-11 competition winner – Richard Hickling (of AEMO) – bid <200MW (just 0.6%) higher than the actual demand peak. Winter 2009 competition winner – Andrea Prouse (of EnergyAustralia – i.e. the original Sydney retailer!) – was 577MW from the mark in a winter that failed to spark. Summer’s peak in demand in summer 2008-09 , when Thao Doan (of Stanwell) was a whopping 900MW below the peak in a summer that smashed the previous record. Summer’s peak in demand in summer 2006-07 , when David Turnour (of Origin) was about 100MW from the mark (0.3%) Summer’s peak in demand in summer 2005-06 , when Trevor Persal (of Ergon) practically nailed it, with an excellent entry!

    "date": "26-10-2015 01:40:00 PM",
    "content": "Back on 8th October, I spoke at All Energy in Melbourne on this topic. Given the questions posed after the session, it seemed that it might be of value to some WattClarity readers if I narrated over the top of the presentation and included it here, for future reference: As noted herein, there were really 3 topics to be covered within the 20 minutes allowed for the presentation: Topic #1 – What is Demand Response? We’ve been a keen supporter of Demand Response in the NEM for more than a decade and, as noted herein, have been actively involved in helping large energy users gain commercial benefit from one particular form of demand response. More recently, we have begun working with other stakeholders to compile and provide a new resource – which we intend will grow to become an extensive reference to all the many and varied forms that demand response takes in Australia’s National Electricity Market: www.DemandResponse.com.au We’re very keen for your input . Call us (07 3368 4064) if you have suggestions. Topic #2 – What might the “future grid” look like, with high levels of intermittency? In the lead-up to All Energy, I progressively posted some pieces of analysis on WattClarity – with respect to the demand shape that might eventuate, the level of spillage that we might see, and what it means for the ramp rates required of scheduled generators. Further detail is provided in the presentation above. Should you wish to use the analysis we performed as your own starting point for more detailed analysis, we’d be happy to supply you our working files , for a small fee. Here’s details of how you can access these . Topic #3 – What role might Demand Response play? We did not have much time to discuss this during the presentation, after working through the first 2 topics. However I will be very interested to continue the discussion with you – either through comments online, or in person. I hope that this material will prove of some value to you.",

    "date": "05-10-2015 03:35:00 PM",
    "content": "I’m running out of time – prior to my talk at All Energy this Thursday . In order to provide the basis for some objective commentary about how Demand Response , and storage , might play a role in a future world high on intermittent ( wind and solar ) supply, I have been crunching some numbers – as noted in this post (about the demand shape) , and this follow-on (about spillage) last week . The shape that “Scheduled Demand” would take in this future 10x world is certainly different to that which currently applies – representing a challenge for “keeping the lights on” through a combination of other technologies including: 1) Storage, reinjected into the grid at times that would help to moderate the peak demand that would otherwise be experienced; 2) Demand Response, to moderate times of “super peak” demand; and 3) Other forms of (more controllable) generation. In a word, the challenge would be summed up as “Peakiness”. I’ve been scratching my head, trying to work out the most effective way to deploy storage and Demand Response (from a system-wide perspective over the full year modelled) – playing Adam Smith. One chart that particularly jumped out at me was the following, highlighting how significantly the shape of demand curve will have changed in this future world, with ramp rates being considerably higher – both up, and down – than is currently experienced: Returning to my “clapped out 2nd car” analogy to represent the fleet of dispatchable plant that will still be required (to the limits of what storage and demand response cannot otherwise provide for), my suspicion is that the current fleet of thermal assets would be hastened into retirement if they were collectively asked to be as dynamic as this chart would indicate in this 10X world. Of course, by the time we have 10x the amount of solar and wind installed (if that were to happen) the existing fleet of thermal assets would have long since retired. The engineers choosing the new fleet of plant to replace them will need to take the much higher, cycling-induced creep and fatigue loading the above would represent into account in providing for the new fleet that will replace them… Back to the presentation…",

    "title": "Considerable spillage, in the high intermittency “10x” scenario",
    "date": "25-09-2015 08:18:00 AM",
    "content": "A week ago, I posted these initial results of some modelling I have been doing to help me get my head around what the world* might look like in a future (undated) environment where significant capacity of intermittent generation is present – 10 times the capacity installed for time series production levels seen for every 5-minute period through financial year 2014-15. * the world – or at least the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) Given the NEM has (roughly) 3000MW of solar PV capacity installed at present, this means an assumption of 30,000MW of solar capacity in this hypothetical future world. I note this is a more bullish scenario than any of the AEMO scenarios used in the 2015 National Electricity Forecasting Report (though still not as bullish as some industry stakeholders are calling for). There’s also a big uplift (10x) in the capacity of wind assumed. A key point noted in the first piece of analysis was that, as penetration rates climb the energy generated, still being concentrated in the sunny or windy times (all else being the same), becomes so large it’s surplus to total consumption at that time – and hence spills. The aggregate duration of this spillage is shown in the image below: Hence we note (with reference to the table in my prior post ) that the 10W + 10S scenario would deliver a total of 66% total consumption across the year from intermittent sources (wind and solar). That’s the “glass half-full” perspective. The “glass half-empty” perspective is that this would result in some periods where spillage is as high as 20,000MW, and (in total) where there is some amount of spillage 20% of the time. I posted an animation recently of yin and yang of wind in South Australia (currently). The above is just another example – albeit on a much larger scale – of the swings and roundabouts of intermittent generation sources. That’s one of the challenges the NEM would grapple with in accommodating a massive increase in renewable generation based on a simple extension of the current form of the RET (i.e. which is currently providing only two forms of generation – solar and wind – because of their cost advantages over other forms, some of which might be more controllable (or, at the very least, operate on a different intermittency pattern)). Increasing amounts of spillage could act to change the economics of all installed generation sources , and in particular all pre-existing intermittent sources: 1) These intermittent sources are paid (through the RET) on the basis of volume generated, irrespective of time or place, hence lower volumes (imposed by spillage) mean lower revenue; 2) Furthermore, when 100% of consumption is being supplied by intermittent sources, which particular wind or solar plant are told to – or decide to – turn down? Would it just be “last man standing” as the spot price threatens to go more negative? We’re already seeing larger shares of wind production in South Australia meaning SA wind farms are collectively shooting themselves in the foot because of coincident high volumes. To make these duration curves more understandable to a broader audience, I’ve pulled out the first 2 weeks of the year in question and highlighted them in charts below: We can see that peak “net demand” is still aligned with evening time – i.e. there are still evening peaks in this “consumption unserved”, which (especially during the winter weeks above) would be when solar output has fallen to zero. This “consumption unserved” is what the AEMO would be focused on in dispatching other plant to keep the lights on. However any thought of being able to differentiate weekday or weekend demand profiles just goes out the window. The difference from one day to the next results from how much the wind was blowing. What’s particularly of interest to me is that the “peak” is much, much peakier in 10x than it is in 1x – i.e. the concept of base-load demand just does not exist anymore . This is a key point, so just to be clear: 1) In the 0x scenario above, demand varies from a low of about 17,700MW to a high of 30,200MW (a difference of 12,500MW) 2) In the 1x scenario, demand varies from 16,100MW to 29,700MW (a difference of 13,600MW) 3) In the 10x scenario, demand varies from 0MW to over 25,000MW (a difference of 25,000MW). The move to a “peakier” demand shape is already happening and peaks will amplify as more intermittent supply is layered into the energy supply mix. This trend should not be confused with other changes that are occurring with respect to maximum demand. Frequent readers of WattClarity will note that we wrote about this after summer 2014-15 for the whole NEM , and separately for QLD , NSW , VIC , SA and TAS . At the same time, it means the need for (and hence value of) responsive “peaking” capacity (in some form) would become magnified significantly. In a “traditional” electricity supply industry there has essentially been two choices of plant to deploy: 1) Plant with high capital cost ($/MW installed), but low operating cost (incremental $/MWh produced) is best run as much as possible in order to amortise the higher capital cost over higher production volume. This plant has become known as “baseload generation” – whereas it’s my understanding that “baseload” was originally a label applied to demand, rather than supply. 2) On the other side of the equation we have plant with smaller capital cost ($/MW installed) but higher operating cost – because of lower efficiency, intrinsically higher priced fuel (e.g. gas instead of coal) and also uncertainty about production volumes (and hence inability to negotiate cheaper fuel supply arrangements – a problem increasingly facing the South Australian region at present – for instance) . These plant became known as “peaking” plant. Because they were the two choices available (and deployed), it was a happy coincidence that development on the consumption side of the equation could follow in a similar way – hence we arrive at the current point where we have major industrial loads (not just in Australia but around the world) designed with high capital cost and (relatively) low operating cost, incentivising them to “run flat out”. In the new electricity supply industry we’re moving into, the neat categorisation of yesteryear no longer applies. For instance, the solar and wind capacity that features heavily in the 10x scenario are both high capital cost ($/MW installed) – indeed, higher than coal – but very low (though still not nil) operating cost. Hence based on those two numbers they would fit the “base-load” label, but are physically incapable of running all the time. As we move into this new environment in electricity supply, does this also signal a transition (which might take decades) for industrial facilities that are also more “peaky” in nature to correspond with what might be – in this scenario – a distinctly more intermittent nature of supply. Remember that these scenarios (whilst the multipliers are hypothetical) are based on real historical numbers for consumption, for solar and for wind output . They are also scenarios that are plausible under a “more of the same” assumption – which is what, it seems to me, is likely to happen unless some change in policy incentive is implemented and/or a major shift in relative cost structures of other renewable sources occurs relative to solar and wind . Under these scenarios (where gross consumption is assumed to be the same as it was in 2014-15) , it’s clear that “something else” would need to be called upon to fill the gap when the sun’s not shining and the wind’s not blowing . Prudent risk management would call for that “something else” to entail multiple types of technology. Experience suggests that this “something else” might fit into three general buckets: Bucket 1) Storage is certainly flavour of the year, with all the buzz about Tesla and so on… but it’s important to remember that pumped storage hydro has been available for decades – and I have seen at least one proposal for a sizeable addition to that fleet. Bucket 2) Demand Response is my particular point of interest (especially with respect to my upcoming presentation at All Energy ); and Bucket 3) Finally there’s the “some other form of generation” category which seems to fall into two separate lines of thought, with no clear transition apparent to get from the first to the second: (a) We have the clapped out second car analogy with respect to existing assets progressively run into the ground; and (b) We have the [insert your particular hobby-horse zero carbon generation source] potential new development – none of which seems to be likely to get a gig under current policy arrangements. Alinta’s decision to walk away from solar thermal around Port Augusta can be understood as just a result of the current landscape with three factors: Factor 1 = an oversupply of capacity, with the RET pushing more in, suppressing spot prices (and expectations of unassisted and slightly disorderly exit as the clapped out 2nd cars give up the ghost). Factor 2 = the RET (large-scale) delivering more wind, being the lowest cost addition source that qualifies – especially given it is just a $/REC measure, with no reference to time or place. Factor 3 = the SRES delivering more solar, being the lowest cost distributed source. Back to my analysis of this potential future world, with a particular focus on Demand Response (at least for now)…",

    "title": "What would “demand” look like, in a “10x” intermittent scenario",
    "date": "18-09-2015 11:11:00 AM",
    "content": "I’m slated to speak at the All Energy conference in under 3 weeks about what role Demand Response might play in a future environment where intermittent generation sources supply a significantly higher percentage of the energy mix in the NEM. To be able to have anything meaningful to say, I have started crunching the numbers about some scenarios for how the future might unfold. In reading the following I would ask that you keep in mind what I wrote here about models compiled by others pertaining to what a “future grid” might look like. Of course it’s easy to shoot holes in the underlying assumptions of any particular modeller about how the future might pan out. However that approach is a bit like shooting the messenger to spite the message, and perhaps just as dangerous (in my view) as blind acceptance of “so-and-so said this, so it must be right” . Echoing what others have already said – models are always wrong, but sometimes they might be useful . I hope that you find the following of some use. If, indeed, you do find it useful, then I look forward to hearing more from you. If you’re able to come to All Energy to engage during that session, I’d be very interested to hear your input. 1) Constructing “future” scenarios In doing this analysis, I’m side-stepping any consideration about two particularly contentious aspects of the future: 1. I am not considering how quickly this can happen (given various constraints) or should happen (given concerns about climate change, etc…) 2. I am also not considering anything to do with what it might cost in arriving at the destination outlined in the scenarios below (or the other costs that might be avoided in that way). I’ve already commented on various aspect of the inclination to socialise costs whilst privatising profits . With this in mind, let’s just assume we arrive at the following destination – and explore how different (or similar) it might be from current reality … 1a) Assumptions about Demand (Consumption) In the creation of any model, one must make certain assumptions about what the shape of demand might be. Unlike the case 20 years ago (around the start of the NEM), or even just 5 years ago, there’s so much more going on behind the meter. 1. For instance in this report here, Hugh Saddler concludes that the rise in “behind the meter” generation is one of the significant factors contributing to why “demand” (as it’s commonly thought to be) has been declining. 2. So much so that several years ago the AEMO started to talk about three different measures of demand. The following is my paraphrase of the three categories (so it does not exactly match the AEMO’s formal definition): Native Demand = perhaps most similar to “Consumption” (i.e. probably closest to what a layperson might think of as how much electricity is actually used ) Operational Demand = a mid-measure that’s not so much relevant to my analysis. Scheduled Demand = what’s at the forefront of the operation of the market itself – i.e. what’s left over of Consumption (not covered by self-generation) that needs to be balanced by dispatch of generators in the market . My general hypothesis is that the ratio of Scheduled Demand to Native Demand will continue declining as increased volumes of electricity are supplied behind the meter. This should not be controversial, I believe. (i) A starting focus on Consumption, not “Net Demand” Hence to present a “truer” picture (and hopefully avoid unnecessary debate) I have opted to start with a view of Consumption (i.e. total electricity used). The catch is that the AEMO does not publish any data representing this Consumption, or Native Demand. Hence I have had to manufacture this. Since the start of 2015, we have been pleased to work with APVI to incorporate their estimate of the (live) aggregate production of solar from small-scale generation facilities across the NEM states, and in WA, This is shown: 1. On the (freely available) LiveGen Widget available here and here ; and 2. In broader detail in the NEM-Watch installed software product. (Again) with the permission of the APVI, we have constructed a series approximating NEM-Wide “Consumption” for every 5-minute interval in the 2014-15 financial year by adding this estimate to the best data the AEMO supply for Operational Demand. It’s not perfect, we know, but (we believe) it’s the best we can get our hands on. (ii) A focus on 2014-15 Normally, a modeller would need to make some assumptions about how this demand consumption trace would change at the point out in the future under consideration. We’re also ducking that point of contention, by just focusing on the 2014-15 year itself and looking at what would have been the case had the supply scenarios (below) already been a reality in 2014-15. This does mean, then, that there should be no debate about the demand side of the model, as we are using “actuals” (to the limit of the accuracy noted above) 1b) Assumptions about the Network I’m also ducking any consideration about what the form (and role) of the network might be at that un-dated future point in time. I’m doing this by focusing exclusively on NEM-wide numbers for everything – NEM-wide consumption, and NEM-wide supplies of generation. Hence it should go without saying that nothing in what I am doing provides a guide for what might be the cost in network development (nor how it should be charged) to facilitate the future supply scenarios. 1c) Assumptions about Supply My primary point of interest (in terms of the analysis for All Energy) is to understand the role that Demand Response might play in a future scenario with loads more intermittent generation. It seems to me the next step in this process, then, would be to determine what the curve for “Unserved” Consumption might be – i.e. what’s left for the market to supply, for every 5 minute period over So I took the actual aggregate trend of wind output for 2014-15 as one input data stream, and the aggregate trend of (small + large) solar output * SEE CORRECTION BELOW trended (small-scale) solar for 2014-15 as a second data stream, and simply grew them by a number of different multipliers – effectively creating 100 different scenarios , all being permutations on what actually happened in 2014-15. * CORRECTION in preparing for the analysis, I had envisaged creating a “total solar” trend for 2014-15 by adding the (APVI) small-scale series to the (AEMO) large-scale series, but decided against that on the basis that the large-scale series only began in March 2015 when Nyngan was commissioned. I reasoned that it was better to just use small-scale numbers so as not to overly bias production in April/May/June months because of the large-scale capacity in those months only. Implicit in this approach is that the future will represent “more of the same” – in terms of outputs, and standing behind this more of the same (just bigger) in terms of policies, and relative costs, etc… In other words, it’s assumed that this happens without new technology (nuclear, or solar thermal, or geothermal, or wave, etc…). Even seeing more diversity in terms of siting (for wind) or orientation (for solar) would change these scenarios, somewhat – following on from previous comments several years ago . For each of the 100 scenarios, then, I looked at the total consumption (the same across all 100) and subtracted total intermittent generation (different for all 100) to produce the total energy “unserved” as a remainder. This remainder is then expressed as a percentage of total consumption in the following grid: It should be obvious that, as penetration of wind and solar increases, it supplies more of the total consumption. It should also be reasonably obvious that there will be some declining efficacy of this type of approach because (at the root) there are three data series (consumption, wind and solar) that are not correlated – hence there will be increased spillage (all else being equal) as we move down to the bottom-right in the grid. This is also shown in the following chart (where the curves can be seen to flatten out, somewhat, towards the bottom-right): Different people will view these results different ways – some will view the 10W + 10S scenario as a “66% full glass” whilst others will view if as “34% empty”. In reality both are true. However the above is really not the main story in terms of my current focus. It’s just summary data that helps to set the scene. 2) A Duration Curve – in three parts To understand what the role Demand Response might play in the future, we really need to get into the detail of the time-series trace of the Consumption “Unserved” – to understand how that “Net Demand” trace looks. However 100 scenarios is too many to start with, so I opted for a diagonal slice through the matrix above – i.e. from 0W+0S through to 10W+10S. For each of these (now only 10) scenarios, I derived a load duration curve – as shown here: The 0W+0S scenario is presented to provide a reference point, though it is not possible in reality (i.e. it implies that existing wind and solar capacity was to disappear – something some particular people might like to happen, but not likely). It’s clear to me that there are three different stories that can be seen in these curves: 2a) More energy supplied by intermittent sources The headline news is that more intermittent supplies would reduce the “unserved” energy that needs to be served from other sources: These “other sources” are currently predominantly coal-fired sources (with some gas, and some hydro added in). What they might be at this un-dated future point in time is not really relevant to this particular analysis. 2b) Energy spillage A second story shown in this duration curve is that increased penetration of intermittent sources (beyond a certain threshold we are still some way from) will lead to increased spillage of energy: This increased spillage will have flow-on consequences in several areas. One of these will be the declining production volumes for incremental addition of new capacity, which will compound the declining spot revenues available (as these have already been seen to be “penalised” in some locations ) to make projects harder to finance. 2c) The peaks get peakier Finally (and most interesting to me, given the current focus for this analysis) is that the peak demand gets much, much peakier with increased penetration of intermittent sources (where “demand” is thought of as the consumption unserved by intermittent sources). This will obviously present its own challenges – which is what I am trying to work through with respect to the role of Demand Response . Back to the number crunching, for now (and looking forward to seeing those who are interested at All Energy).",

    "title": "Yin and Yang of Wind in the South Australian region of the National Electricity Market",
    "date": "11-09-2015 11:09:00 AM",
    "content": "Over the past couple weeks (partly in relation to this prior article on WattClarity ®) I fielded a number of questions offline, relating to wind farm production in South Australia (which has been, for several reasons) a very topical point of conversation in recent times. Whilst we have previously provided several animations online here with respect to market events using our ez2view higher-end dashboard (these animations several years old so looking quite dated now compared to the current version) , that software is definitely designed for those who are very involved in the NEM. Hence, as a result the animations are very detailed (hence for narrower consumption). To illustrate the yin and yang of wind over a 4-day period last weekend for broader consumption, we changed to using our NEM-Watch entry-level dashboard which, despite being 15 years old now, is still a very popular tool for new entrants, market spectators, commentators and other stakeholders. Especially with the inclusion of a live feed of the APVI’s estimates for small-scale solar production in each region, it does provide a clear, high-level overview of what’s going on in real-time. We recorded this animation for other purposes, based on conversations with particular people, but hope you’ll also find it of value here on WattClarity : Perhaps this might help to make more tangible the limitations of a (simplistic?) single-point-in-time view of the on (spot) price-suppressing effect of intermittent supply, now popularised as “the Merit Order Effect”. This animation is provided not because we’re particularly pro-wind (or anti-wind), as noted before , but rather because we believe it will help to raise the general level of awareness about the complexities inherent within the underlying electricity supply system, and hence the market constructed on top of it. In preparing this information, we switched a few options within NEM-Watch to make it clearer for general consumption in the animation (we turned to static arrows, and made the number sign relative to the arrow – i.e. changing from AEMO standards). For industry insiders, please keep these in mind when viewing. Next week I really have to get started on that analysis I promised to do for the upcoming All Energy conference in Melbourne (less than 4 weeks away now). As noted before, I promised to do some thinking about what the NEM might look like in the future with higher penetrations of intermittent generation – and particularly what that might mean for Demand Response .",

    "title": "A further look at the idiosyncrasies of wind in South Australia",
    "date": "31-08-2015 09:29:00 AM",
    "content": "Following on from comments received (online and offline) with respect to my article a couple weeks ago with respect to see-saw wind generation in South Australia (and hence prices as a result) I have been pondering a couple of things – but unfortunately no time to dig deeper. With a short amount of time late last week, I powered up NEM-Review to begin the task of delving further, but have had to curtail that contemplation to come back to the here-and-now. Rather than leave the analysis I’d done gather dust, I’ve presented two charts here for a sample of 21 wind farms in the NEM highlighting two key metrics that, I believe, sum up the two sides of the puzzle: 1) Capacity factors The sense I have picked up by reading commentary (and hearing comments) by people interested in wind energy in recent years is that there are people who sit at either end of two extremes: 1a) At the bottom end, there are those who operate with a rule of thumb that wind farm capacity factors will be 30% (with a layperson possibly inferring, from such comments, that this forms an upper bound to the capability of wind farms); whilst 1b) At the other end, there are those who speak about wind farm capacity factors of 45% and above (with the same layperson, if listening to this other conversation, possibly inferring that most wind farms will be achieving this 45%-and-above, whilst the 30% mark is an out-dated one of yesteryear). With reference to 21 of the wind farms currently operational in the NEM, here’s how they have actually performed: We can see from the above that, with the plant selected, the capacity factor did reach as high as 45% (one wind farm in one year shown – Snowtown in SA in 2013-14), but that there are also a number of wind farms bumping around at, or below, the old 30% mark. There is a fair spread of capacity factors from a low of 25% to a high of 45%. There’s a few series on the chart, so I have tried to make it more useful by colouring wind farms in SA some shade of red , wind farms in VIC green , wind farms in NSW blue and the only TAS wind farm shown black (my apologies if I made a mistake in some of these). What we can see, in the above, is that the wind farms in South Australia are the ones which are achieving the higher capacity factors – which provides some answer* to the question I asked back in this post here These higher capacity factors are especially relevant when considering that a significant proportion of the revenue earned by wind farms is a “simple” $/MWh measure (through the LRET target) that does not take account of the effect that increased production of energy from wind has on the broader energy market. Wind Farm Revenue = LRET Market Revenue + Energy Market Revenue The remaining amount of the the revenue earned by wind farms (Energy Market Revenue) is, however, affected by these locational factors – as discussed below. 2) Spot revenue “penalty” The other side of the coin is shown in the second chart, below – where I have calculated the average spot revenue earned by each of the wind farms. I’ve then taken that number and expressed this as a ratio to the time-weighted average spot price for the region in which the wind farms are located. For ease of understanding, the same colours have been used: Ratios less than 100% show that the wind farm is earning (per MWh) less than the average spot price for the region. In contrast, the volume-weighted average price for the year (i.e. paid by the “average” energy user) is typically above the time-weighted average spot price – because spot prices typically are higher when demand is higher. As can be seen in the above, wind farms in South Australia are (by this measure) “under-earning” their counterparts in the larger regions because of the larger depressing effect wind has on spot prices the South Australian region because: (a) Wind farm output shows high degree of correlation across South Australia (as all readers can observe by watching the NEM-Watch Live-Gen widget on RenewEconomy or in more detail in NEM-Watch itself ); and (b) Especially because aggregate wind farm output (when windy) represents a significant percentage of the demand in the region. In other words, performance to date of the LRET has seen a high proportion of wind attracted to SA because of higher capacity factors on offer – despite the fact that the large volumes of energy dumped into the energy market as a result are eroding the return all SA wind farms* are earning for their NEM component. * note – “return all SA wind farms…” might be more correctly labelled the returns earned by the counterparties exposed to spot prices for the revenue earned. That’s probably a key distinction. 3) Questions for the future It seems likely to me that the future will see even more of this dichotomy emerge in the South Australian region (i.e. lower prices when the wind is blowing and sun in shining, versus higher prices as thermal plant seek to recover fixed costs over less MWh when it’s cloudy and still). Hence the “Revenue Discount” shown above for SA wind farms will continue to grow – which might lead to its own form of self-perpetuating spiral. Now that there is (perhaps) some “certainty” about the 2020 target for the LRET, and stakeholders think more about what the trajectory might be out into the future, perhaps considerations might be given to whether simply continuing a split revenue-stream model and increasing the target is the most appropriate mechanism. I will continue to ponder this aspect of the evolving energy market and (as time permits) continue to analyse and post insights earned on WattClarity ®. 4) Considerations for All Energy As noted back in that other article, I am slated to speak at All Energy on 8th October , and so will really need to start digging deeper soon to be able to have something meaningful to say. In particular for that talk, I’m puzzling about the interaction of intermittent wind and intermittent solar on the supply side (with decreasing thermal capacity to cover for cloudy, still weather) and what could potentially be much more flexible demand patterns on the other side of the equation (with heightened price-responsiveness, more demand response , and storage of course). If you’re also particularly interested in this intersection, I’m keen to hear from you in the next couple weeks – tel +61 7 3368 4064. If you’re going to be at the conference, I’ll look forward to saying hello!",

    "title": "Pitfalls of Demand Management for the Domestic Electricity Consumer",
    "date": "17-08-2015 09:34:00 AM",
    "content": "Much time and effort is currently going into the development of home energy management systems, one of the objectives of which is to enable the customer to “smooth his electricity demand” by switching appliances on or off so as to reduce his maximum demand. Whilst this is seen as desirable, in that it purports to reduce the customer’s requirement for electricity network capacity, much of the effort is in fact counterproductive . Only switching actions, which genuinely shift customer load entirely away from periods of likely network maximum demand , contribute positively to network economics . Switching actions which merely smooth the customer’s load do not. The reason for this counterintuitive outcome is that networks are not built to meet the individual demand of individual customers but are in fact built to meet the collective demand of groups of customers. And when the collective demands of individual customers are aggregated, the random variations between customers automatically sum to zero. Typically the average demand of a collective group of domestic customers will be @ 1/3 rd of their individual maximum demands. At the collective level it is therefore only the customers underlying (or systemic) load pattern that matters. Here it is important to distinguish between the purely random and the systemic variations between customer load profiles. There is no point in managing a customer’s purely random variations down to zero, thereby reducing his demand to one third, if the result is that all the customers in the collective end up with similarly smoothed load profiles, with no random variation. Having destroyed random variation, the sum of the collective demand will be the same, as if no Demand management had been undertaken. Nothing will have been achieved. However if Demand Management is aimed at changing the customers underlying load profile, by shifting demand entirely away from times of likely network maximum demand , then that is a constructive outcome. However it too has its pitfalls. A great deal depends upon whether the future for network tariffs is: Time of Use Demand , Time of Use Energy or, Controlled Load tariffs (see note below ) Option 1 = Time of Use Demand Tariffs Whist Time of Use Demand Tariffs will provide some incentive for customers to shift demand entirely away from peak periods, their main incentive will be for customers to simply smooth their demand (as this will achieve the greatest and easiest reduction in the metric they are charged for). Time of Use Demand Tariffs will thus likely create a market for load management systems, which deliver little or no benefit for the network, with potential loss of amenity for the customers. Option 2 = Time of Use Energy Tariffs Time of Use Energy Tariffs, on the other hand, provide no incentive to smooth demand throughout periods of potential peak demand but do provide strong incentive to shift demand entirely away from the peak periods . The problem with these tariffs is that, whilst the process of aggregation during the peak periods will continue to “average out” purely random variations, the incentive of cheaper prices at the end of the peak period will incentivize synchronized “switching on” of appliances by customers at the “price break time”. The natural random variation between these loads will be destroyed and “artificial” network peaks created . Appropriately priced intermediate or shoulder charges go only part way towards addressing this. Editor’s Note Here’s a prior article highlighting what can happen on the energy market side if significant load returns at these “price break times”. Option 3 = Controlled Load Tariffs The industry has traditionally offered customers “Controlled Load Tariffs”. The advantage of controlled load arrangements is that they enable the distribution business to engineer variation into switching times , thereby creating artificial load variability, thus enabling the sculpturing of the collective load profile so as to optimally match network capacity. Differences between the 3 Options The load management technologies of these three approaches, whilst having many common features, are fundamentally different. At one extreme, there is the technology required for continuous real time management of a full myriad of customer; IP addressable, appliances such as is advocated by IT and Communications Industry interests (with its potential for “Big Data” processing requirements). At the other extreme there is the relatively simple minimalist technology required to remotely control, a limited number of significant high load appliances, which either have no timing imperative (such as pool pumps) or which have within them inherent energy storage capacity (such as storage hot water heaters and electric vehicles). From a network management perspective investment in Option 1 is unlikely to achieve any better an outcome than (or indeed as good an outcome as) investment in Option 3 – other than, perhaps the perception of “greater customer choice”. That is not to say that there are not other potentially worthwhile benefits from investing in Option 1. Customer home energy management systems that enable customers to conserve energy, offer the convenience of automatically anticipating customer needs, or which offer energy trading benefits may be sufficiently valued by customers to warrant such investment. However it is important not to attribute network economic benefits to such investments , if those benefits can be more effectively delivered in alternative minimalist ways. Notes about the Three Tariff Options Energy-Only tariffs charge customers for their aggregate energy consumption (kWh), during the billing period, whereas Demand Tariffs charge customers for their maximum demand (or peak rate of energy consumption (kW or kVa)). Controlled Load Tariffs charge customers lower prices for energy supplied, to selected appliances, at times which are controlled by the Distribution business (normally off peak times), but which remain unsupplied at all other times (normally peak times). Time of Use (ToU) tariffs (both energy only and demand) charge customers different rates at different times – normally higher rates at peak times and lower rates at off peak times. An intermediate, or shoulder charge, also usually applies. About our Guest Author Mervyn is a career engineer, engineering consultant and professional company director.

    "title": "Seeking to understand the great Network Debate",
    "date": "12-08-2015 12:58:00 PM",
    "content": "Back in mid-2010, I did start to put together this synopsis of opportunities and threats for (major) energy users – however, as you’ll note from that article, it was never finished. In particular, one of the areas in which I did not have time to focus (and write) is in relation to network costs, which have grown since the start of the NEM to represent a larger percentage share of the total cost of electricity delivered in the NEM – whilst wholesale unit energy costs have remained largely the same ($/MWh) over the same period. In the intervening years, the “network debate” has increased in volume and (at least it seems to me) the complexity of the positions on all sides. I have tried below to relate my current understanding of the key elements under debate, in the hope that: (a) Others, who are more knowledgeable in this area, can fill in some gaps; and (b) These starting notes (plus comments from more learned experts) might assist others who are also striving to understand what the debate’s all about. PLEASE NOTE In the discussion below, WattClarity ® Readers should note that reference to external material should not be taken as support (or otherwise) of any particular point of view. Rather, this post is provided to indicate the current state of my understanding of various perspectives in the debate – and, as such, might help others also seeking to understand. From the outside-looking-in, its seemed to me that the points of contention seem to fall into four categories as noted below: 1) Underlying boom/bust cycle With my career having been based in the energy sector, and now into its third decade, I’ve watched with interest what’s seemed to be an underlying boom/bust cycle that has seemed to sit beneath much of the results more apparent at the surface. My sense has been reinforced by tales told to me of older/wiser people who have been in the industry longer than I, and can remember the day when… etc The pattern has seemed to go like this: (a) Some scarcity event occurs – in which case the signal is sent to the Engineers to build, build, build. This signal might be sent through a market price, or might be sent more explicitly by a “the lights shall stay on” responsible Minister, or through some other means. If this boom stage is pronounced, then new metrics start to emerge that seem to take on a life all their own – such as “build rate”. The use of such metrics seems to shift focus away from the original reason for the build and the need to build takes on a life all its own. For instance, the Queensland region of the NEM was under-supplied right at the start of the NEM – and, following from that state, we had the commissioning of QNI plus 2,000MW of capacity at Callide C, Millmerran and Tarong North in relatively quick succession. Naturally spot prices fell, as a result (given a competitive market). (b) Then one day someone will realise that the cost of this supply has increased significantly (a customer, if on the regulated side), or profitability has fallen (a shareholder, on the market side) and the engineers will be reigned in. It becomes the Era of the Accountant whose mantra seems to be (in simple terms) running existing assets as hard as possible to generate higher utilisations and more effective returns. Over this period, a different set of KPIs are put in place – and, in some cases, also begin to take on a significance all their own – just like metrics such as “build rate” in days of yesteryear, they take on a meaning that becomes more and more separated from their original reason for being. What’s happening in global Iron Ore seems very similar, where a “stronger for longer” mantra has given way to a focus on slashing costs. (c) Everything seems to run swimmingly until something happens and the system that’s been gaffer taped together starts to spring a leak somewhere, which signals the Return of the Engineer – and so on it goes in cycles…. We’ve seen that these cycles are sometimes “helped” on their boom/bust way by aggressive (poorly thought-through?) government policy – such as noted by Nigel in relation to the ongoing SolarCoaster . Just today I noticed this post from TransGrid , which seems to strive to make the trade-off between investment and reliability more transparent (and the decision more explicit). This oscillation around an underlying growth trend (at least up until 2008 or thereabouts ) also seems to have parallels in other industries and with particular companies, and I have sometimes wondered whether it has to be that way – i.e. is it really possible to continue to have a dual focus on growth, and efficiency at the same time? Perhaps the ability to properly manage both challenges simultaneously is what sets the well-managed companies (and industries) apart. 2) How much to invest (or has been invested) Within the context of this underlying boom/bust paradigm we’ve seen an unprecedented change in the NEM, as in established electricity sectors across the world, in that demand has been declining in recent years. Whilst the rising tide might float all boats, the fact that the tide has gone out has exposed the fact that the industry has, to some extent, been swimming naked. This has, it seems, significantly compounded this aspect of “the network debate”. Graphically, my understanding of this part of the debate can be summed up in the following graphic: Currently, we’re beginning to see what I think is the second round of regulatory decisions being made by the AER on allowable capital investment on the part of each of the NSPs (transmission and distribution companies). I believe that these are showing lower levels of capital allowed than was the case 5 years prior – but I have not had time to check where these levels are with respect to the levels allowed 10 years ago. 2a) How much WAS invested One of the reasons why network costs have increased is because of increased capital allowances conveyed through periodic regulatory “Revenue Reset” decisions for the network businesses. For the middle period in question (shown in the illustration above) there was much mention made of two factors justifying an increase in capital spend: 1. There was much talk of growing peak demand . Whilst hindsight is truly a wonderful thing, and does present the “what were they thinking?!” question after the fact, I remind myself what I wrote here on WattClarity in mid 2009 (i.e. around the time of that regulatory decision) illustrating that I was certainly not wiser than those producing load growth projections at the time. 2. There was also much talk about replacement of ageing infrastructure . I’m not sure where this process is at. Summing this all up, there is a sense that some of this capital was for assets that (in the “declining demand” paradigm) are no longer required – i.e. the red bars above. If the NEM was operating in an environment whereby demand was continuing to increase, then it might just be a matter of time before demand “caught up” to network capacity – but now there are open questions about whether some capacity will ever be needed (or at least, from an economic point of view, needed within a timeframe to make the investment seem reasonable). This is the bit that some have called this “gold plating” (though perhaps, by some interpretations, this is not so accurate/helpful a term). Whatever the cause, what seems to be the eventual end-result of this component is that some of the “overcapitalised” asset value will (sooner or later) be written off . I can see different arguments for who might bear the cost of such a write-off: 1. It might be the asset owner (hence shareholders) , on the basis that they had built more than was required (and were involved in the generation of the load growth projections used to support the CapEx in the first place). However such a decision would not be without concerns of long-term effects due to changed perceptions of sovereign/regulatory risk (i.e. an outcome of “changing the rules of the game”) 2. It might be the government (hence the taxpayer), on the basis that they put the rules in place that produced this current result. Not without a political cost, and loads of finger pointing, as “wasn’t me!” politicians are prone to do. 3. It might be the customer that ends up carrying the can (hence with a bias towards big energy users) on the basis that they will be the ones that squeal the least. Another concern of energy users ! See my prior notes about the problematic nature of a capacity market on the energy side . Here’s Bruce Mountain’s view of write-downs as a way to address stranded assets in electricity networks. A different perspective is provided in this paper by the Energy Networks Association . Here’s some other commentary by Keith Orchison , and another from Joe Dimasi . 2b) How much is TO BE invested in future Much has also been written, in the past couple years, about a “Death Spiral” – one of the first mentions I can recall was this paper by the AGL paid or Simshauser and Nelson in mid 2012 . Whether or not such a calamitous outcome arises remains to be seen (as it will be dependent, in part on questions such as those following). However it does serve to illustrate the fundamental challenge of a regulatory regime which effectively locks in Capital Investment up to 7 years in advance in an environment where future load trajectory, and hence need for the network, seems much less certain than was the case 10 years ago. Surely there’s a better (i.e. more incremental) approach – however such an approach would not be without its own incremental costs, including: 1. Probable higher overhead costs of compliance, required at the NSP and the regulator as a result of a more continuous stream of data flowing backwards and forwards; and 2. Unavailability of volume discounts on “bulk purchase” of certain kinds of equipment that is a sound approach if demand is more predictable, but more risky if demand is uncertain. 3) What rate of return is allowed Let’s assume that we’re just talking about the green bars above (i.e. that through some magic wand or other economic tool we’ve managed to deal with the over-investment in the red bars above). 3a) Allowable return There still remains an issue, which has become increasingly debated, about what a “fair” return should be for “allowable” capital spend on the networks. The theory goes that the network businesses are lower risk (i.e. monopoly supplier, so guaranteed a return), so should receive a lower return than would be the return achieved by companies operating in a competitive market. What seems simple in theory appears to me, from the outside-looking-in at the debate, much more complex in practice – as it evolves to all the letters/variables and arcane acronyms that go to calculating a company’s allowable WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital). This Grattan Institute report from 2012 is one of a number I have noticed on the topic. There was a diagram published in the past week or two (that I can’t find now) which highlighted actual returns of network businesses (I think by Return on Equity) compared with others in the competitive sector that purported to show that the network businesses were achieving higher-than-necessary returns. If I find it later (or one of our readers points it out) I will link it here. 3b) How much actually is recovered Notwithstanding the discussion point above, there seems to be another issue that (at least in my reading) does not seem to have gained as much focus – that of how much of this return is actually being recovered (in real cash in the bank), if volumes are declining? I think the theory goes like this – the AER allows a return (i.e. total $$) which the network business then translates into some kind of tariff (predominantly $/kWh at present – see below) at which point two things might happen: 1. From an accounting point of view, this revenue (being “guaranteed”) might be able to recognised in the books. 2. However if volumes decline, then this might lead to an under-recovery. Hence the books might show X whilst the bank balance shows Y (where Y < X). If the revenue is truly “guaranteed” then the problem might just be a timing issue, in terms of recovery of revenue – but what happens if the demand does continue to decline, and the gap between X and Y widens over time? 4) How these allowable revenues are charged to energy users So let’s assume that we’ve worked out a “fair” amount of investment, and a “fair” return for the network businesses. I’m coming to realise that this does not mean we’re out of the woods yet – as illustrated here: 4a) What the network business charges The AEMC passed a rule change, effective from 1st December 2014, requiring network companies to structure network tariffs on a “Cost-Reflective” basis ( here’s the press release , and here’s the details ). Again, what seems to be simple at first glance, but appear to be a lot more convoluted in practice. I have not had time to read through the background material the AEMC has helpfully provided yet (so it’s my fault if the following is misguided) so I do wonder “what costs?”. Are we talking about recovering past investment (i.e. sunk cost), or are we talking about sending price signals to incentivise future behaviour to optimise future costs ? I’m not sure these are the same things (perhaps readers can help me understand)? Already there seems to have a couple different approaches emerge to the implementation of cost-reflectivity amongst the network businesses. There has been much written about the effect these mooted changes will have on various types of stakeholder in the electricity sector, such as on Monday in the FinReview – and many more bytes of space in focused publications like RenewEconomy (plenty of comments) and Climate Spectator + discussions at many events such as this CEDA event and this ENA event I was unfortunately unable to attend. This whole debate seems to have become significantly more clouded through the emergence of a significant number of vested interests across the industry, and a splintered (survival-focused) political narrative . 4b) What the energy user sees Even if the distribution company could determine the “perfect” tariff structures, the effect of these would probably be obscured through the fact that it’s the retailer that bills us as consumers, not the network company directly. This might be especially the case for those retailers still struggling with billing system issues. Are we, as part of this industry transition, going to see the evolution to the point whereby we start receiving 2 (unbundled) bills for electricity : 1. A “grid connection” invoice from our network company – which might be more akin to our monthly fixed price charge for internet connection (where it’s my understanding that the costs are almost solely related to the infrastructure we connect to) for those of us who don’t “snip the wire”; and 2. A separate “energy supply” invoice from our retailer – for those of us who don’t wholly supply (matching our consumption profile with self-generation each five minutes of every different day , in all weather conditions) ourselves with self-generation + storage. Whilst the network company might incur added costs in the provision of individual bills to each customer, perhaps the benefits delivered in terms of real response to peak network events (which Chris Dunstan alluded to here , and which we’d like to provide more focus to on our new site here ) would more than cover these added cost – and put us on a path to a more sustainable future. That’s all I have time for today… (but I will be very interested when more learned people than I can help fill in the blanks, and correct the errors, in the above).",

    "title": "Why large energy users are concerned about last week’s machinations in South Australia",
    "date": "03-08-2015 02:05:00 PM",
    "content": "On Tuesday 28th last week, I posted these comments about a few of the machinations occurring through South Australia during the week. As noted in that article, and by Ben Potter on Thursday in the FinReview , we received a number of calls from large industrial energy users in South Australia who were wanting to know what was going on. (A) Why are they concerned? A1. Some are spot exposed … For many years we have been serving a number of large industrial energy users who have had some form of spot price exposure in their electricity retail contracts – or, in some rarer cases, directly with AEMO. These energy users provide a form of Demand Response to the market by curtailing consumption when spot prices are high : (a) This delivers a benefit to the market as a whole, by helping to moderate spot market volatility; and (b) It delivers a benefit to the energy-user themselves, by delivering them lower average cost of energy than would be otherwise possible. Some energy users who operate this way like to talk about their experiences – whilst others prefer to keep the nature of these arrangements confidential (as being part of their competitive advantage). These energy users are keenly interested in what’s happening in the spot market in the region in which they reside. Some of these energy users have sites in South Australia – and some of these people asked questions last week about what was happening. A2. … whilst most are not Whilst the method noted above works for some energy users, it does not work for everyone. However a broader (and growing) number of energy users are watching the spot market , though perhaps not as intently as those above, because of how spot behaviour flows through to wholesale contract prices – and hence through to retail contracts (especially for the growing number of energy users seeking to time the market in terms of when they procure blocks of load). Some of these people called as well… My understanding of the concerns above can be thought of in three ways: Concern #1 – absolute prices in the week that just happened, Concern #2 – a need to understand what’s behind this (including questions about “gaming the system”) and Concern #3 – concerns about what this might bode for the future, with increase in renewables and a (perhaps “disorderly”) closure of thermal plant anticipated. (B) Some observations about what’s happened? I don’t have as much time as I would like to ponder these types of things, given a few other initiatives we have on the go at present – but the following is provided in case it’s of value to some of our readers. B1. South Australia is awash with (coincident) wind Given that, historically, South Australia has has higher spot prices than prices in other regions, it’s been no real surprise to see that South Australia has seen a significant amount of wind farm development enter this region in particular – a combination of (a) good wind resource (best in the NEM?); (b) higher historical prices (c) lack of hiccups in planning requirements (in contrast to VIC). The following trend of average data for financial years in South Australia from NEM-Review illustrates the result: As can be seen, wind production in South Australia has continued to grow, year-on-year. Combined with the fact that total generation has been declining since 2010-11 (i.e. non-wind sources declining significantly ) this means that the share of energy generated from wind in South Australia has grown to reach 37% of total metered generation* in 2014-15. * i.e. metered generation = what AEMO publishes data for, so it excludes smaller generation (and particularly residential solar PV). Coincidentally back in August 2013, I did some rough numbers to work out the NEM might support 37% wind production , though not without its own challenges. Is what we’re seeing in South Australia currently an indication of what would be the case for the NEM as a whole if this happened (or would the outcome be more extreme, given the NEM’s not connected to any larger market elsewhere). Whilst a casual observer might look at a summary chart like the above and conclude that there’s plenty of market opportunity for more wind in South Australia (i.e. because the South Australian price is still averaging above the average price in Victoria), the devil lies in the detail – with last week a good case in point…. B2. Last week, SA spot prices operated in 2 different paradigms It should not be a surprise to anyone, really, that prices dropped when large volumes of wind generation flooded the market, and then rose back up when the wind stilled. This is shown in the 2 charts below taken from NEM-Watch showing the trend in both over the week: There were, last week, clearly two separate paradigms operating in South Australia in terms of spot pricing – when the winds was blowing, and when it was not. Quite clearly there are “windy day” prices, and “calm day” prices – and it appears that the gap between the two is widening . That’s something that’s not captured at all in the summary analysis (such as in the first chart above) and poses a real problem for all generators in the region (wind, thermal and other). Given that the thermal fleet has a “fixed” (i.e. sunk) cost of capital, it’s not really a surprise that prices in the low-wind period are higher than they might otherwise be as generators seek to cover the same fixed cost base over a lower number of hours when the wind’s not blowing. I think I noted about some limitations of simplistic modelling earlier in this post in relation to the RET Review . My sense is that energy users are concerned about what this means for the future – and whether they will have to get used to an operating paradigm containing both sides of the boom/bust coin : (a) Low or negative prices when the wind’s blowing (which impact on the viability of all plant – including wind farms); but also (b) Higher prices (as a result of fixed cost plant chasing fewer hours to run) when the wind’s not blowing. From their perspective, especially if spot-price exposed and providing demand response (as above), it would be exceptionally difficult to operate a (capital intensive) plant with a capacity factor significantly lower than 95% (if trying to curtail when prices are high meant much of the time when the wind’s not blowing). Sounds like the same problem “base load” coal generators are having. B3. Gas prices were high, but not wholesale changes in bids What’s more unusual in the second chart above are the number of hours shown where prices hovered around the $300/MWh mark, or above (keep in mind that it’s a log scale that’s been used for clarity). In my post last week I highlighted how spot gas prices at the Adelaide hub of the STTM were high on Monday 27th July. GasWatch has a useful Time Travel™ feature that can be used to step back in time and show the market conditions for a given historical day – the following shows last Thursday (30th) as it shows prices wound back from the peak of $10/GJ on Monday 27th (coincidentally the day with low wind and high electricity spot prices) as the week progressed: Some might assume that with gas prices high, all gas-fired generation would raise their price to reflect the higher cost of gas. However that was not the case. Using ez2view (our tool for detailed analysis of particular nuances of the NEM) we see the following comparison of a trended bid-stack over 2 weeks for SA gas-fired generation: We selected the week in early April on the basis that it was a week with lower gas prices, but also after Pelican Point came offline (at the start of April). What this also means is that it’s also a week of lower electricity (and gas) demand, not being the winter season. The most obvious finding in the comparison above is that the July week saw significantly more gas plant bid into the South Australian region of the NEM (which makes sense given the higher underlying demand). It’s also clear to see that the vertical space covered by blue and green bids (i.e. bids up to $300/MWh) was higher in the week just passed than in the week during April – i.e. gas-fired generation was not all bidding capacity at much higher prices due to higher spot gas. We do see, however, the effect of more rebidding of capacity during last week, with a more dynamic colour profile in the top chart. B4. Individual Behaviours Whilst I’d like to have more time to delve into individual participant behaviours (second only to sitting on a beach this week and enjoying the warm Queensland summer), this is not unfortunately not possible. (C) Implications for the future C1. Decline of Thermal Generation Those in the industry (and outside) who support carbon reduction targets for Australia will understand the inevitability that the existing fleet of thermal plant is undergoing a terminal decline. Whilst this much is (mostly) not questioned, key questions remain, such as: C1.1 Over what time period? AGL’s much mooted “closure by 2050” announcement must win credits for gaining mileage from just stating what’s pretty obvious to the broader industry. On the left of field, there are others who wish to see far more radical change achieved by 2030, or even sooner. There’s a world of difference in between these positions – and what looks like no hope of sound, long-term, bipartisan policy in the foreseeable future (especially with ongoing concerns about the lack of leadership still shown at ministerial level ). C1.2 The degree of disorder in, and level of support provided during, the closure process? Starting from the position that the NEM, over its 17 year life (to date) has proven to be a market quite resilient to past challenges – like the drought of 2007 – I have been pondering this question (amongst others). Ben Potter, in his article last Thursday quotes others raising the prospect of some form of capacity payment to assist during – and possibly past – the transition period. Capacity payments were one of the options canvassed previously by AGL (and I think updated in this paper from June 2015) . Capacity markets are not without their own warts, however – as I noted before on WattClarity . C2. When will spot market implications of coincident wind output change locational decisions? One of the things that’s been puzzling me for some time has been the apparent willingness of wind farm developers to use development sites that deliver a wind farm with an output profile that appears very aligned to the output of other wind farms in the region. Demand in the South Australian region is much smaller than the size of demand in Victoria, NSW and Queensland, as is clear in our “Live Generation Widget” on RenewEconomy – for example in this snapshot from early afternoon today: To be clear – as more and more wind is layered into South Australia, this will continue to drive spot prices lower and lower (to the extent to which wind production patterns are aligned), with more prices being close to, or below, zero. It seems logical that this would prove problematic to any new project developer trying to bank a project based in South Australia where its output is going to significantly contribute to “windy day” prices dropping even further. Yet the most recent ACT power auction awarded a contract to the Hornsdale project – another one in South Australia (one of many listed on the 2014 update to our “Power Supply Schematic” market map ). Back in August 2013, I pondered much the same thing in this post . We’ve separately had discussions with several developers who claim that their wind production profiles would be very different from that currently exhibited. However I also note that those projects remain on the drawing board. What am I missing here? C3. What would incentivise other types of generation capacity? There are various stakeholders in, and around, the market that have assumed a number of other technology choices might be made to get to a 100% renewables scenario (or at least some high degree of penetration). These might be concentrated solar thermal with storage, geothermal, hydro (though not many sites – not counting clever use of disused mining pits), pumped storage hydro (even with sea water pumped up to the Flinders Ranges?!), and even the “dreaded” nuclear projects. The current state of low-emission technology deployment in the NEM suggests that, left to its own devices however the invisible hand plonking down generation capacity across the NEM will continue to select centralised wind and distributed solar. What would make this change? C4. With, and Without, Storage Cases As I think I have noted elsewhere, any crystal-balling into the future (as imprecise as such an art-form is) must now consider two very distinct scenarios – being with, and without, meaningful deployment of storage. How much storage would need to be meaningful , you might ask? If the NEM now has more than 1,000,000 households with rooftop PV solar systems installed – and is starting to see significant impacts at a regional level as a result, it seems reasonable to infer that it would be around the same numbers of residential storage systems would need to be deployed for a meaningful (macro) impact on the market. Gut feeling says that this number deployed will be significantly more than the “technology enthusiasts” (geeks) and the “visionaries” (I hate my energy company) people – hence requiring a decent number of “pragmatist” buyers in the early mainstream (who buy on the basis of real commercial value and proven performance). Geoffrey Moore’s “Crossing the Chasm” provides a good description of the type of challenge this represents. The solar PV rollercoaster (which Nigel Morris described here before recently switching seats) was supercharged by some very generous incentives for residential customers ( myself included ) but, unless I have missed something, I have not seen much clamouring for similar style incentives for storage. C5. Other Impacts on Market Design Running out of time here, so just some dot-point lists of other implications we’re puzzling through…. C5.1 Are we becoming a net pool by stealth? When the NEM was established, a deliberate choice was made that the NEM would be a “gross pool” market – i.e. all generation capacity would be scheduled and dispatched by the AEMO, with contracts between counterparties being financial instruments of one sort or another. With the rise of semi-scheduled wind production (at times when it’s not being scheduled) and the rise of rooftop PV, is the NEM moving towards a “net pool” market by stealth – and what are the implications of this? C5.2 Would the Market Price Cap have to rise as high as $80,000/MWh? It was with interest that I noted this (May 2015) presentation by Dr Jenny Riesz of the Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets at UNSW pondering the same sorts of questions as what I had been wondering about – as the market moves towards one with much higher levels of intermittency (and hence potentially severe boom/bust pricing) what would need to happen to the Market Price Cap to keep the lights on in an ordered way – in the absence of capacity payments? Jenny’s note about spot prices as high as $80,000/MWh is certainly food for thought (or indigestion?) C5.3 Implications for Demand Response Returning to the question posed through questions received from energy users during last week, this is something we’ll have a number of reasons to puzzle through. Amongst other initiatives during 2015, we’ve been putting together this general-access resource on the different methods of demand response that currently operate in the NEM (www.DemandResponse.com.au) – and so have been pondering how these forms of demand response might change as the market evolves…. (D) Thinking about Demand Response, in time for “All Energy” Conference on 8th October Given our background as a long-time supporter of Demand Response within the NEM , I’m happy to agree to speak at All Energy in October on the topic of the role that Demand Response could play as the market continues to evolve (from centralised to decentralised energy supply). That’s only 2 months away now, so I’ve not too much time to start thinking about this in more detail. Any readers particularly interested in this topic, I would like to hear from you ahead of time – either leave a comment below or contact me offline (tel +61 (0)7 3368 4064) That’s all I have time for today…",

    "date": "28-07-2015 01:28:00 PM",
    "content": "Ketan beat me to it in providing this chart highlighting a new all-time record for wind production this week across the NEM ( peaking at 3,378MW at 20:10 on 25th July according to the chart), eclipsing the 3,200MW level noted here on 10th May . Here’s the same data with the colours a little more understandable, from our full NEM-Watch Gold/Platinum application: Quick notes: (a) Wind is a more understandable green colour in the chart above (why the oxymoronic brown, Ketan?) . (b) Unfortunately we still only have permission from APVI to include 24 hours of history of the small-scale solar data ☹ so it does look a bit odd on this chart stretched out over a longer-term history (and still no possibility of adding into NEM-Review either). In a strange parallel to the very polarised debate about renewables (and broader climate) policy we’ve been “served with” (though one does wonder in whose service) in Australia over the past few years, we’ve seen almost the two extremes of wind production just a few days apart. Yesterday I only had time to tweet this image (juxtaposing GasWatch and NEM-Watch snapshots) to highlight how high gas prices – $10/GJ – at the Adelaide hub of the STTM were combining with almost non-existent wind production in South Australia to deliver sustained high prices over the day yesterday (and also today – averaging $250/MWh through the day today to 13:00): It was no surprise, really, that we also fielded a number of calls from clients of ours who are large energy users in South Australia, concerned about the ongoing viability of their businesses in state where the influx of renewables has been one factor (NOTE – there have been others) already noticeably, for some, having an impact on the prices they pay for their energy through: 1) Accelerating closure of Northern (though was this more just due to dwindling quality coal supplies?); and 2) The stated “perhaps” closure policy at Torrens A , not B (or were they foxing for capacity payments?). This has also been compounded by the ongoing unavailability of the large Pelican Point combined cycle gas turbine in the state (shown in the trend below from NEM-Review ) which would, were it available, be going a long way to alleviating the tight supply/demand balance and so some way to alleviating higher prices: (yes, I realise that I should probably have coloured Pelican Point as something other than green!) The NEM does have some big challenges ahead, from the point today where the industry transition is poised to accelerate – especially if an aspirational (i.e. vote-buying?) Labor 50% by 2030 brain-wave does evolve into considered & serious policy (i.e. built in a way that it does not make a 50% level “easier” to reach by virtue of the exit of significant slabs of large-scale industrial energy use from the country). Who was it who called this a “diabolical problem”? One organisation that might help us all wade our way through the swamp of climate/renewables/energy policy is the AEMO , which coincidentally has scheduled some sessions in all capital cities in the next 2 weeks titled “Renewable Energy and the NEM” .

    "title": "The RET Joyride",
    "date": "24-06-2015 07:42:00 AM",
    "content": "Now that legislation has passed through Parliament, and the Government works to implement the required regulations, it is timely to take a look at the Renewable Energy Target (RET) and how we got here. A post mortem of sorts . As a policy, the RET has a pretty poor track record. Since its inception in 2001 the RET has spent more time under review than free of reviews. That has been made worse as each review has struggled to be fully implemented before the next review gathers pace. Along the way we have seen the original target expanded to take over from state-based schemes, artificial multipliers to encourage uptake of certain technologies, splitting the scheme between small- and large-scale to limit cross-technology competition, and a disconnect between costs of permits and technology. Other ‘highlights’ have included some woefully inaccurate modelling of electricity demand and rate of uptake of rooftop solar that has meant the policy’s impacts are seriously at odds with its designer’s intent. For anyone whose business is materially impacted by RET – and that includes major electricity users as well as renewables investors – it has been an eventful joyride. It has created a situation where all players seek changes to the rules to resolve their “anomalies” while also seeking stability in the scheme. If the most recent stage of the RET joyride – the Warburton Review and subsequent negotiations – started in the land of good policy ( and that’s a big ‘if’ for people on both sides of the debate), it certainly didn’t spend long there before passing briefly through politics and arriving in a strange place of personalities and brinksmanship . At a glance, the RET targets appeared to be an orderly increase in the requirement for large-scale renewables (LRET), building off the base provided by the original MRET and “shandied” with the contribution from the small-scale scheme (SRES). What that orderly graph hid was the extent the policy would have overshot the initial intent of “20% renewables” due to declining electricity demand, and the overheated level of activity brought on by the small-scale scheme (compounded by State incentives). The graph below is a truer reflection of RET prior to the changes of 2015 . Editor’s Note It’s our understand that this second graph shows (for prior years) actual aggregate STCs created each year from the SRES scheme, hence reflects two significant factors: 1) that small-scale systems (under SRES) are credited with assumed “lifetime” production of energy up-front; and 2) for 3.5 years a multiplier was applied to the STCs that would normally have been created – as follows: June 2009 – 30 June 2011 = multiplier of 5 July 2011 – 30 June 2012 = multiplier of 3 July 2012 – 31 December 2012 = multiplier of 2 January 2013 – onwards = multiplier of 1 (i.e. reduced back to unity 2.5 years ahead of schedule) The LRET target alone – 41,000 GWh from 2020 – would have delivered more than 25% renewables. On top of this, the small scale scheme (SRES) was delivering many multiples of the estimated 4,000 GWh and would continue to do so despite some of the heat being taken out of that market through reductions in the multiplier. The Warburton Review ( linked here, whilst it’s still available ) – or more correctly the Ministers and Shadow Ministers who negotiated the outcome, and in doing so, rapidly moved on from the recommendations of the Warburton Review – had these realities to deal with, along with a strident campaign from the solar industry built around popularity of rooftop panels with voters and a (surprising for some) suggestion from the modelling that RET was exerting downward pressure on electricity prices. It prompted the question from some – if the technology needs a subsidy because it is more expensive, how is it driving prices down? That prompted the answer from others that it is the result of forcing new generation into an oversupplied market and the losers may be the owners of existing capacity in the short-term and consumers in the longer term. Electricity-using industry – like aluminium smelting – had plenty at stake as well. Aluminium smelters have attracted costs of more than $500 million since the RET commenced and this was slated to grow at a further $70-80 million per year. This cost wasn’t for a structural change in our electricity supply or for any Good or Service that we used, as aluminium smelting relies on continuous base-load power of a type that the RET was not instigating. It was a simple transfer of money from what might have been profits for our businesses (were market conditions better) to create profits for renewable energy businesses. The extent to which we felt the pain of RET (and any policy that impacts electricity prices) can be seen in the graph below. On the vertical axis is the electricity-intensity of the industry – the higher the column the greater electricity costs are as a proportion of total costs, and the more exposed that industry is to electricity prices. On the horizontal axis is the total value of production – the wider the column, the more of that activity we do in Australia. The total size of each ‘block’ is a measure of how much electricity is used in that industry and the likely amount of any electricity-related cost that is being paid. It is easy to see why RET was a hot topic for the aluminium industry, and why other industries also had a strong interest (many of them with operations in Tasmania, attracted there years ago by reliable, efficiently priced electricity). So as these positions and forces came to bear, some early indications appeared in the negotiation process: The recommendations of the Warburton review had less impact than expected; The rooftop solar campaign came early and hard; Downward pressure on electricity prices from RET became the accepted reality; The policy intent of “20% renewables” became subservient to the target of 41 000 GWh, rather than the reverse; Exemptions from RET costs for trade exposed industry received support from (almost) all sides of politics; and The case for a reduction in RET targets beyond that needed to provide an exemption to trade-exposed industry failed to gain much traction. So agreement was quickly reached on elements such as: no change to the small-scale scheme; exemptions for emissions-intensive trade-exposed industry; and an end to two-yearly reviews (or so we thought). The negotiation narrowed in on the level at which the LRET target would plateau after 2020. The Opposition started at the existing target of 41,000 GWh, the Government started at 27,000 GWh. Negotiations broke down. The Opposition moved to mid-high thirty thousands, the Government moved to thirty thousand. Negotiations broke down. The Government moved to 32,000 GWh, the Opposition moved to 35,000 GWh. Negotiations broke down. It seemed inordinately difficult and time-consuming to reach a deal on a number that was jarringly obvious to most observers . The mid-point of the opposing positions at each point that negotiations broke down was around… 33,000 GWh. A critical question around the future target was the achievability of investment and construction to meet the target. If the target couldn’t be built, certificate prices would rise to the penalty price and the worst outcome would be delivered – higher electricity costs without the benefit of investment. When the investment required to meet the range of targets was compared to historical investment (as in the graph below) a number of conclusions relevant to the negotiation become apparent. Editor’s Note It’s our understanding that historical capacity factors were assumed forward into four future years to translate each year’s incremental GWh target back to MW installed capacity The graph suggested that the Government (and the rest of us) had good reason to be worried about whether any of the proposed targets could be built. Assuming 2015 equalled the best year on record, then the next four years had to be double the previous best or more. Though it should be noted the task has not been helped by the 2014 lull in investment that resulted from the review itself. It is also clear that even the lowest of the proposed targets was not going to kill investment and would, in fact, require four spectacularly good years of investment for the renewables industry. And ultimately it led some to question whether the calls for higher targets came from those keen to invest or build or from those with an interest in high certificate prices or political outcomes. Ultimately, sanity prevailed (or insanity, depending on your preconceived views). A deal was reached that included: An LRET target of 33,000 GWh from 2020 ; No changes to the small-scale scheme; Full exemptions for emissions-intensive trade-exposed industry ; Removal of scheduled two-yearly reviews (despite a late hiccup). The major parties held to historical views on the inclusion of native forest wood-waste (Government for, Opposition against) that also enabled some final fiery arguments in the Senate. So through the good efforts of many individuals, and despite a number of significant setbacks along the way, the RET now seems to have a more solid and durable base than for most of its past. But beware the lessons from history. This is a policy that has rarely sat stable for more than a few months. There are clearly strong and opposing views still held within Parliament and indeed within each major party. Labor has indicated that it views the 33,000 GWh target as a minimum and is likely to take an increased target as part of its platform to the next election. The RET joyride, that has proved so eventful thus far, may well have a few more twists, turns and hurdles to serve up yet.

    "content": "With our brave Captain Tony on the “Team Australia” tinny carrying on the Quixotic quest today – tilting at windmills because of their poor visual amenity ( see note below ), accompanied by the customary squawking from the gaggle of onlookers on social media , I would have easily missed the somewhat more significant announcement made today in the energy space – except for the eagle eyes of two journalists, both: (a) Angela MacDonald-Smith in the FinReview (b) Matt Chambers in the Australian Matt’s tweet references this article here from Meredith Booth . In this article, Alinta CEO Jeff Dimery is quoted as saying the closure of Northern Power Station (and associated mine) could happen “as early as April next year” , with a hard use-by date of March 2018 . Any links to the current outage at Northern Power Station? Coincident with this (surprise, but understandable) announcement, we’ve been watching the machinations in the South Australian region with a deal of interest this week following the unfortunate power station fire at the Northern Power Station – we posted this NEM-Watch snapshot earlier on Twitter : I’d posted these quick comments on Tuesday evening , following the first day of volatility South Australia saw as demand rose following the public holiday Monday. We noted that Giles had earlier provided his own views on the outage , and what it meant in terms of the renewable energy drive. Given the two events (the fire/outage, and the closure announcement) happen within the same time-frame, I would not be the only person to wonder if there is a linkage – though I can hardly imagine a company like Alinta making a decision like this on a spare of the moment…. (including with an organised visit to site to break the news) The NEM-Watch snapshot above highlights the 2 attempts that Northern has made to come back online. The first attempt ended around midnight this morning, which means bids are currently available for that period, whilst the second attempt was only today (so no bids public yet). A quick look above at the rebid reasons in ez2view for yesterday’s attempt shows what could be expected at a station trying to come back online after coal stockpile fire, with associated problems. I had posted earlier about the “clapped out car” analogy to the struggling power sector . Whilst we can’t be sure of the extent (if any) the closure decision for Northern is related to unsustainable maintenance costs at the station, it is likely to be an area of increased interest to a number of stakeholders in the months and years, moving forwards… Looking backwards, over the longer term To provide some context to the “slide into oblivion” that is the Northern Power Station, I powered up NEM-Review to draw the following longer-term trend: (click on the image for a better view) In particular note that the early part of 2015 has seen lower production volumes than in the decade 2000-2010, but (importantly) that the spot revenues were not reduced by the same percentage (i.e. the reduced output at the station coincided with – and probably contributed to – an increase in the per MWh revenue earned in the spot market compared to that which would have otherwise been earned). Hence, unless I am missing something, it does seem that the tactic (of reducing output in response to a supply glut in the market) did help to increase revenue per unit of production – but that this was not enough to save the station, given the capital costs involved and the bleak outlook for the sector given the ongoing trend in declining demand (such as noted here for South Australia over summer 2014-15 ) and the recently secured continuance of the RET , albeit towards a reduced target. ———————– PS – What’s all this about Visual Amenity in the energy sector? I can’t believe this is what’s being talked about, by our leaders – and the followers (oops, me included now). Can anyone honestly point to much, at all, in the energy sector that is actually visually appealing ? 1) Centralised thermal power stations and associated infrastructure (whatever the fuel) – including the recently completed large-scale Nyngan power station ; 2) Long lengths of power transmission lines, or above-ground* distribution through suburbs (* because it’s too expensive to underground them) 3) Wind farms on “scenic” ridges 4) Solar panels slapped any-which-way on rooftops in character suburbs as a result of overly generous “get in quick” feed-in-tariffs of yesteryear, and the accompanying less-than-honest sales tactics employed by some companies I saw & heard at the time. Perhaps the Snowy Mountains Scheme could be called “attractive” (keeping in the mind that attractiveness is always in the eyes of the person looking through them). But reality is that there’s no other place we can build such a thing, over again – and it certainly would not earn a premium in the market for being “a good looker”. The majority of energy infrastructure is ugly – get over it. Whatever the technology, it’s being deployed to keep the lights on, not to win an Archibald (or whatever the architect’s equivalent prize is). Is this really the “grown up government” we were promised a couple years ago , or just an ongoing malaise of squabbling kindergarten kids that we have become accustomed to in Federal Parliament over quite a number of years…?",

Hence it might be of interest to some of our readers that the higher demand in South Australia this evening, along with the reduced output from wind, has led to the increased production from gas, and even a little output from (more expensive) liquid fuelled generation – as seen in this NEM-Watch snapshot: That’s one of the reasons why the price has spiked as high as $589.50/MWh (on a dispatch interval basis). Note that one* of the reasons scheduled demand is higher is that some of the wind acts behind the meter to reduce scheduled demand (so was a factor in a lower demand peak yesterday evening) – though keep in mind that the SA demand peak shown (around 2,000MW) is still a long way below its peak. * weather probably also played a role (I have not checked), as would have the public holiday on Monday (albeit peak demand was after 5pm).",

    "title": "Is the real issue related to 5 minute dispatch and 30 minute settlement?",
    "date": "09-06-2015 07:50:00 AM",
    "content": "The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) is considering a proposed change to the National Electricity Market (NEM) rules that is entitled “good faith bidding” . The NEM operates as a continuous series of auctions, where the market operator seeks to select the lowest-cost available generation in each 5-minute period. According to the proposed change, at issue is the timing and quality of information provided by market participants in advance of each auction, and whether this information is accurate and can be relied upon. Most auctions have no requirement for accurate and timely bids and offers. Participants are typically free to bid (or not) and offer (or not) as they see fit, with no need to consider the consequences of their actions on other participants. In most auctions, as in most markets, participants are expected to act purely in their own profit-maximising self interest. Electricity markets auctions are different only because of the underlying physical nature of electricity, and the need to reliably maintain continuous electricity supply. To paraphrase the objectives of the NEM, participants in the market are expected to profit maximize but must only do so in a way that does not threaten the security and reliability of electricity supply . The embedded assumption here is that prices in the NEM will be regulated by competition among electricity suppliers, and that free and fair competition will result in the lowest cost, reliable supply of electricity to consumers over time. As a result of a rule change in 2002, the National Electricity Rules (“the Rules”) require participants to bid and offer in good faith (clause 3.8.22A). For every bid or offer, a participant must have a genuine intention of honouring it, if the material conditions and circumstances remain unchanged. In the thirteen years since this clause was introduced (and the prior four years of operation), there has not been a single incident where reliable electricity supply was interrupted or placed at risk due to the bid and offer strategies of participants. So the question becomes – what is the problem that needs solving? The importance of this question is revealed by the AEMC in its draft determination document . AEMC states that the good faith bidding provisions were introduced in 2002 due to concerns of the jurisdictional ministers that wholesale price outcomes were being manipulated. The proponent of the rule change to modify the good faith bidding provisions (the South Australian Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy) is concerned that the outcome of a Federal Court decision in 2011 “introduced uncertainty around the operation of the bidding in good faith provisions and highlighted issues in relation to the implementation of the original policy intent.” Said another way, the South Australian Minister is not concerned about the security and reliability of electricity supply, but rather the possible manipulation of wholesale price outcomes. The rule change has been proposed with the objective of regulating prices. To answer whether prices need to be regulated through a restriction on bidding behaviour, the following questions need to be considered: Q1. How material is the issue? Q2. What circumstances and/or conditions motivated the request to regulate prices through the good faith bidding rules? Q3. Is there a better way to address the concern? Materiality The AEMC commissioned analysis to determine the materiality of the need to regulate prices. The analysis ( here and here ) supports the conclusion that as a result of late bidding practices, price spikes have occurred in South Australia and Queensland in the last year. It is reasonable to conclude that late bidding practices probably resulted in price spikes in other areas at other times as well. However, with average prices in the NEM well below all reasonable estimates of the price needed to justify building a new generator, it is also reasonable to conclude that the transient pricing power caused by late bidding does not occur frequently enough nor with sufficient financial impact to suggest that there is a need to regulate prices It is the author’s view that this issue fails the materiality test. Ordinarily, the AEMC stated that it would reach this conclusion (see p25 of its draft determination document ). However in this case, the AEMC concluded that because new fast-response generation or load activities could not respond to the price signal created through late rebidding, there might still be a need to regulate bidding activity. Rather than dismissing the need for a rule change because it lacked materiality, the AEMC asserted that competition cannot take place – an assertion which does not appear to be borne out by the facts. This review is being considered in an environment where market prices are being manipulated at a macro scale by extraordinary policy shifts and technology forcing subsidies. Policy makers’ concern over a few, infrequent, short-term, and broadly immaterial price spikes in limited geographic areas is misplaced. Motivation The motivation to regulate bidding behaviour appears to be the desire of the proponent and the AEMC to avoid explaining price spikes enabled by the market design, even in an environment where prices are below their long run expectations. The AEMC state that its consultants found that “late rebidding often has a role to play in responding to forecast price spikes and reducing anticipated market volatility” with the implication that this was a “good” outcome. It also found that late bids “in Queensland has resulted in price spikes”, with the implication that this was a “bad” outcome. The NEM is designed to be a volatile market when necessary and participants have the tools to manage the associated risks. This volatility contributes to overall pricing which signals the need for new entry; and the type of volatility highlights the type of new entry required. This short time frame volatility merely highlights the value of a faster response plant. Given this, the AEMC has not articulated why price spikes that result from late stage bidding responses are inconsistent with its stated objective to “allow the market to trend towards a longer-term equilibrium”. Is the solution really to impose a greater administrative burden on participants in the industry through the information requirements and complexity of the good faith bidding rule changes, or can we do better? The More Important Issue The proposed good faith bidding provisions are intended to address the inability of market participants to respond to bids and offers made immediately before a dispatch interval. However this inability is a function of: 1) The physical limitations of plant (both generation and loads) to respond to a modified price signal within 5-minutes; 2) The physical limitations of the transmission network and how it is represented in the NEM algorithms to allow competition across locations; and 3) A peculiarity in the NEM Rules that averages the 5-minute dispatch interval price outcomes into a half-hourly trading interval price . The AEMC considers that the physical limitations (1 and 2) favour generators that are online and regularly being dispatched. In some time periods, these generators can re-price their offering just before a dispatch period with only limited risk that their volume outcome will be lower because of the reduced competitive threat caused by the physical limitations. The averaging of price outcomes into half-hour trading intervals (3) distorts this further . Bidding behaviour that modifies a price outcome in a single dispatch period impacts the volume in the other five dispatch periods of that trading interval. A price spike in the last dispatch period will increase the price received for electricity volume in the five previous dispatch periods, effectively on an ex-post basis. Conversely, a price spice in the first dispatch period will carry over into the following five dispatch periods, artificially motivating additional supply. At its forum on good faith bidding in Brisbane, the AEMC heard how Sun Metals lost a month of production because, although it can respond to a 5-minute price signal, it could not risk being exposed to the ex-post recalculation of trading interval prices during the volatile summer period. The averaging of the 5-minute price across the previous five dispatch periods means that even if an end user is able to completely avoid consuming electricity during, say, the last of the six, five-minute price intervals that are averaged to form the NEM’s 30-minute settlement prices, a price spike in that last five minute interval will spillover—through the averaging process—causing prices in the other 25 minutes to be higher. Clearly, this sort of averaging greatly reduces the incentive to develop the sort of demand-response capability that is a natural competitive counterbalance to late-stage supply rebidding. Why does this market peculiarity still exist? Rather than introduce a confusing layer of faith-based regulation that risks ensnaring both legitimate responses to changing market conditions and the occasional sneaky bidder, why not tackle the underlying problem by increasing the effectiveness of competition instead? These are clearly issues worthy of being addressed, and should not be hidden underneath a restriction on legitimate bidding competition between market participants To address the physical limitations, the AEMC should investigate ways that network constraints are managed and represented in the NEM to reduce the number of time periods when the market is geographically sub-divided. Improvements in accuracy and a more dynamic representation of transmission constraints will enable competition to regulate prices. • Removing the averaging of prices across trading intervals will de-leverage late bids. It promises to simplify the market and improve its pricing transparency. The AEMC acknowledges that late bidding provides a useful role in price discovery process. However we need to be careful not to judge its value through quantifying the direction or volatility of prices in any limited period or geography. Late bidding allows market participants to absorb, consider, and respond to all information, limited only by the constraints of 5-minute market auction process, the need for electricity supply to be reliable, and the real physical constraints of the participant’s assets. Equally important, aligning prices to their underlying cause clarifies the value of fast response. It is not hard to imagine improved generation and demand-side response if the identified market flaws are addressed. The dynamic response in the medium term might involve new technologies. This is how markets work. Our Conclusion The AEMC is incorrect to consider regulating bidding activity to address issues in the market design. Late stage bidding is a necessary adjunct to the longer-term support of faster demand and supply response – a good outcome in the long-term, as it aligns with the increasing importance of faster response capability in markets with greater generation supply intermittency. However, such responsiveness is limited by price distortions resulting from the 30-minute averaging of dispatch interval prices. Moving to five-minute pricing , fully, would reduce incentives for manipulative activity as well as enhance incentives for faster demand response. The AEMC should shift focus to this much more important problem .

    "title": "Recapping Australia’s SolarCoaster Ride",
    "date": "28-05-2015 08:38:00 AM",
    "content": "Twenty something years is a long time to spend on a roller coast, especially if it’s a solar powered one. When I started in solar all those years ago, I had a naïve ambition that solar would save me from the volatility of the automotive industry where I worked at the time. I got that kind of wrong, but there has certainly never been a dull moment on this ride. I was recently asked to present at the Energy Users Association conference (in Brisbane in May) and used the opportunity to recap on the changes I’ve witnessed . I spoke on behalf of my business, and for Solar Choice . The event and audience was somewhat different to what I’m used to and I must admit, one of the more challenging gigs I’ve done. The audience included some businesses and analysts who were interested in what solar could do for them, but there were also a number of very large users and utilities who frankly, see solar as huge pain the backside. When the solar industry was in its infancy and the very first grid connected solar system was connected in 1994 at Mt Coolum in Queensland, solar cost around $27/Watt installed. A builder at that trailblazing home site will go down in history for his scoffing comment “hmmmfph; this will never catch on”. It may have been expensive, but it’s still working today and was a testament to what the future would look like. Only 18 months later, Australia’s first Commercial PV system was connected when a north coast business installed a 10kW, three phase PV system with wind and battery back-up for good measure. It was connected after long negotiations with an agreed export rate of $0.02c/kWh. Fast forward twenty odd years and its getting hard to keep up with the numbers of grid connected systems which now exceeds 1.3Million. Costs are typically around $1.00-$1.50/W and although it’s been a long time between drinks, storage is coming back with a vengeance. As I described to the audience, we have seen rebates, support and incentives come and go over the years but by 2011, a perfect storm of price reductions, favourable foreign exchange rates and hyper support sent the solar market into overdrive. When solar One was installed, annual sales in Australia were around 1MW per year and by the end of 2011 it had reached 1,000MW per year and cumulative capacity has grown from around 8MW to more than 4,000MW. Growth, support, rebates and incentives have a cost of course and I was left under no illusion as to what this meant to some energy consumers by the speaker preceding me at the Energy Users Association conference. “The RET is a massive challenge because of the wealth transfer” was my take on the core of his message. The previous speaker walked off the stage and I took to the podium with my presentation about “how awesome solar was”. Awkward. I stuck to my story but focused on the truth that there are undoubtedly winners and losers in every market and acknowledged that the revolutionary change that has been happening has created challenges for some business sectors. 1) I highlighted that during many of these politically motivated incentives, the solar industry had actually argued against excessive support . We could see that hyper support would create a bubble (with associated problems resulting from that) but politely said thank you and got on with the job once the decisions was made. 2) On the other hand, we have also come out ferociously in defence of support where the changes were considered too harsh, too abrupt and the consequences ignored. Today, putting aside the legacy costs of FIT’s, the solar industry effectively has a single support mechanism which is the Renewable Energy Target. Some argue that its cost is too high as a subsidised abatement measure. We will of course argue that subsidies and wealth transfers exist across a huge array of sectors and that comparatively, we still receive relatively little. We will make the point again, that there are costs and benefits to society with solar, as there are with the prolific uptake of air-conditioning, for example. The simple fact of the matter that I highlighted to my audience is this; Solar is massively popular if you are an energy user although it clearly works better for some than others. Tens of thousands of businesses are using it along with millions of homeowners and whilst there will continue to be ups and downs, there are no brakes on this ride because costs are headed in one direction. Around 5 million Australian’s live or work under a solar roof today and not understanding their enthusiasm and passion for solar will only end in pain. Compared to other interest groups, solar owners are extraordinarily engaged and protective of their beloved, bill reducing solar panels. At the macro level, the evolution of regulatory change to adapt to distributed rather than centralised energy architecture won’t come easily. But it will come, as long as consumers naturally continue to want more control over their energy costs. The hype around storage is quickly turning to real sales, too, and will add an exciting new dimension to the re-invention of the energy market. The naysayers will tell you it’s too expensive and doesn’t make an adequate return and is fraught with dangers and to some degree I actually agree. However, this assumes that consumers are rational and of course, they aren’t . They are emotional and react quickly, sometimes spontaneously to technology and things that ease the pain of daily life or improve their bottom line in business. If there is one thing that twenty years on the solar coaster has taught me it is this; when you do a half decent forward forecast about new technology uptake you will inevitably look back in ten years and realise you were no-where near optimistic enough. The builder at Solar One was wrong twenty years ago and personally, it’s my view that the solar haters are wrong too. It’s not a matter of if; it’s only a matter of when.

It was also noted by others, on Twitter , that the NEM reached 25% of its total generation supply being delivered by renewable energy (hydro, wind and solar) on Sunday afternoon – at least for the 13:10 dispatch interval highlighted. Note that the image provided comes from the NEM-Watch widget we’ve developed for RenewEconomy (it’s static in the image below but live in the link). The windy weather down south has been persisting for a number of days now – and has continued into this morning. Frequent readers of WattClarity will understand that we do strive to remain generation source agnostic . Our role is just to make the complexity in the energy market more understandable – whatever its rules of operation just happen to be. We hope that, by doing this, negative unintended consequences of policy choices that governments choose to make on behalf of their constituents can be reduced. Judging by the fact that I’ve been accused (by some) of being a front for wind farm developers, and also (by others) in the pocket of “big bad coal” I’m inferring that we’re not doing too badly at that (though, of course, there is always room for improvement). Naturally, the South Australian region contributes a sizeable percentage of the total wind supplies in the NEM – see the following chart (focused on South Australia and) extracted from our NEM-Watch software this morning: Part of the value of NEM-Watch is that it allows people (participants, spectators and commentators) to gain a clear view of how variables such as the above are integrated into the broader scope of what’s happening in the market – so they can more easily understand the implications of such events as high wind in South Australia. This morning I noted that AEMO has, once again, flagged a “LOR2 warning” for the South Australian region in its Market Notices – as highlighted in the following snapshot from NEM-Watch (and triggered through SMS alerts to my phone): I’ve annotated this display to help readers understand a few of the significant variables. Double-clicking on the Market Notice in NEM-Watch launches the full text of the market notice, as follows: Astute readers will notice, in the window of Market Notices within NEM-Watch , that similar Market Notices were issued last week. Readers in South Australia will be aware that this “credible contingency” did not happen last week (i.e. so the lights did not go out). 1) Hence we can (and should) conclude that – just because AEMO says it might happen, does not mean it will happen . I have previously commented, for instance, on doomsday predictions for security of supply . 2) However the converse is also true – just because it did not happen last week, does not mean it won’t happen today (or at some stage in the future). (a) Indeed, probabilistically speaking, it is almost guaranteed that it will actually happen on one (or more) occasion when AEMO issues a Market Notice such as this at some stage in the future – if the market does not respond. That’s why it’s deemed a “credible contingency”. (b) The key take-away here is that the South Australian region is operating in a less secure state than the Market Rules would like it to be at present, due in part to: i. maintenance works on transmission (which are being incentivised, under the rules, to schedule these works when they don’t ordinarily have a market impact – so times like now!); and ii. high wind production in South Australia. Unfortunately, in this case, I’m not aware of too much that the market might actually do in this case, given that windy conditions in South Australia are making it uneconomic for most thermal generation to start up, at present. It would be possible to shift the maintenance outages away from windy periods – but there would be costs associated with this, as well. Longer term, if further renewables were to be added to the grid particularly in South Australia: 1) This might give weight to the business case for augmentation of interconnection capacity between South Australia and the east (but to do so in a way to reduce the risk that these credible contingency events might happen – which might mean not augmenting along the identical flow path). 2) It might also provide an added boost to Demand Response – at a 150MW potential shortfall in South Australia today (if the “credible contingency” event were to occur) there would be a number of our customers involved in providing this Demand Response , as the price would spike to the Market Price Cap if load shedding occurred. 3) Needless to say (especially with recent press coverage) there will be many who will view battery storage as the panacea in this case. I am interested to learn what the response rates might be in this respect (i.e. in response to rapid frequency drops should the link be lost) – perhaps one of our readers might elaborate? That’s all I have time for today… PS – in the interests of completeness, readers should note that the AEMO Media Twitter account provided these details about this LOR2 notice today: My apologies for any readers who might have missed my reference to the transmission outage in this post.",

    "date": "10-05-2015 02:38:00 PM",
    "content": "During the past week, we helped Giles post this article noting that wind farm output had reached 2,988MW as a new record (higher than what we saw over summer 2014-15 , for instance). Today I noticed that, in the quiet of the night, wind output had roared along and peaked at 3,215MW in the 00:05 dispatch interval (meaning metered generation output measured at 00:00 leading into Sunday). This point in time is shown in the following snapshot from NEM-Watch v10 (using “Playback” to reset the display to how the market looked back at that time): See, that this had represented about 16% of the Scheduled Demand Target used by AEMO in dispatching the market: However note that: 1) this is not a correct measure, strictly speaking, as some of the wind output is non-scheduled, so nets off Scheduled Demand – the real percentage would be somewhat lower than this). 2) also note that demand around midnight is being inflated by off-peak hot water load in South Australia, and that (more generally) demand does not reach its low point across the NEM until around 4am each morning. The above, however, is indication of how the latest projects added to the grid late in 2014 are contributing to the increased output. Continuing into this afternoon, we see that the high wind output has continued (though slightly lower) and has been one of the factors delivering very low Scheduled Demand levels across the NEM, and also very low prices – negative in places: If it’s true that the political argy-bargy over the RET target is closer to resolution (not withstanding the latest political point-scoring shenanigans) then this is the type of thing we might be seeing much more of in the years ahead to 2020.",

    "title": "What are, and will be, business niches for aggregators?",
    "date": "04-05-2015 05:29:00 AM",
    "content": "Last Friday, I was fortunate to be invited to speak at a QUT Energy Forum with 2 other industry stakeholders – Mike Swanston (until recently with Energex) and Richard Schoenemann (recently joined Sunverge). It was a prior event of this type at which I’d heard Professor Gerard Ledwich speak at a couple months ago – leading to his guest article here on WattClarity . Following on the same underlying theme (with respect to the changes the electricity supply industry is grappling with at present), we three presenters were all asked to speak on the topic of “What are, and will be, the business niches for aggregators?” During my presentation, I indicated that I’d post some further thoughts on WattClarity later – so here’s what I managed to prepare over the weekend … What is an aggregator, anyway? The term “aggregator” is a term that seems to have come into vogue in recent years in the energy sector – but it was only when I started to prepare for this talk, that I stopped to think of what the term actually means, in terms of the energy sector. Perhaps this was the reason why 3 experienced industry executives had been asked to present their own views to the audience at QUT? Starting from first principles, I asked myself the questions – “Aggregating what? Why?” As discussion-starters, I illustrated 11 different types of aggregators we can see currently operating in the electricity supply industry in Australia. I’m sure many readers will be able to add some more… Some good conversations were had after the session. I’d also invite you (the reader) to contribute to this discussion – either online (below) or offline (call +61 7 3368 4064) – if you’re also interested in what could unfold. Aggregating Electrons As a company that strives to make complexity understandable , so our clients can make better decisions, we like diagrams . A (good) picture tells 1000 words. Two of the diagrams that have delivered value to thousands of people over the years have been our “Power Supply Schematic” and “Power Trading Schematic” Market Map wall charts which (together) detail the physical and commercial structures of the NEM in the east and the WEM in the west. (Massively) simplifying from the “Power Supply Schematic”, I highlighted what I believe is the original aggregator in the NEM (and other industrialised electricity industries): Because of their role in aggregating electrons for delivery to end-users (or, conversely, aggregating dispersed energy users for centralised generation) the network companies (TNSPs and DNSPs in the NEM) could be seen as the original aggregators. Thinking about what alternative methods there might be for delivery of power, two thoughts jumped out: Option 1 – with growing talk of a “death spiral”, and social media chatter showing disillusioned energy users “going off grid” there is obviously a growing desire by some to “cut out the middleman” and connect generation and energy use at home directly. Whether this particular technology will cross the chasm on the adoption curve is a matter for another post sometime… Option 2 – A second option could be thought of in the following pictorial terms – in terms of a fleet of Tesla (or equivalent) electric vehicles charging up at centralised charging points in cities whilst people work, then driving home to discharge in the evenings. Given electric vehicles and (mobile and static) battery storage represent two of the largest looming changes to the electricity supply industry, I’ve been trying to get my head around what it might mean. We had a guest author post some back-of-the-envelope calcs in terms of what it might do to demand, and I tried to work out what it might mean in terms of balancing large-scale intermittency . Perhaps it was somewhat naive to start with a basic bottom-up analysis such as that, but it did help to clarify to me the mismatched scale between the total peak demand requirement in the NEM and what electric vehicles might, on their own, be able to supply. Too many zeros difference for EVs to be able to handle, on their own. However it does leave me thinking what potential network benefits might come out of providing some moderation of evening peak demand through mobile battery storage – hence potentially delivering better economic bang-for-buck than might be possible with just distributed storage at home, with a mobile battery delivering both: (a) Some transport capability for commuters; and (b) Some network optimisation capability, being plugged in at night, at home, when the sun’s down and residential demand begins to peak. Perhaps delivering some benefit in oversizing the storage capacity in cars to enable greater discharge in the evening peak time (then slowly charge up again through the low hours of the night ready to drive out again the next morning)? If one of our readers knows of research that’s been done into this capability, please let me know – either in a comment below, or offline? Aggregating Payments When National Competition Policy reached the Australian electricity supply industry in the 1990’s and the National Electricity Market was formed at the end of that decade, a separation was created between the role of the energy deliverer and the energy retailer – thereafter creating the Electricity Retailer as another form of aggregator in the industry. This separation of responsibilities is the reason for our separate “Power Trading Schematic” . When (simplified and) viewed as below, the energy retailer acts by aggregating payments from (as part of the broader commercial relationship with) energy users to fund the constituent cost components upstream: Asking the same question, again, we also see that a disruptive influence already being felt in this part of the market is with respect to the rapid growth in the number of AER-approved exempt suppliers, largely providing solar PV to residential customers behind the meter on lease-back arrangements. I’ve posted before about the “socialised costs” apparent to me in this “exempt supplier” approach . Delving into a bit more detail (though still a long way from the detail of the “Power Trading Schematic” ) and looking just at the wholesale end of the market, we see another aggregator embodied in the role played by the AEMO, the physical Market Operator. As noted in the slide, I can’t currently see it possible for any other organisation to emerge to compete with the AEMO as facilitator of the physical market, given the “gross pool” nature of the market design of the NEM. I also struggle to understand what potential benefits might come from a move away from this model. On the financial side of the wholesale market, however, it’s a lot easier to see how a competing alternative to the service provided by the ASX and ASX Energy (formerly dcyphaTrade) might emerge: Indeed, I understand that there have already been some moves afoot, in that respect. Aggregating Customers Still at the wholesale end of the market, we have also seen (over the 16+ years that the NEM has been operational) a number of competing firms seek to establish themselves as wholesale brokers in the market – hence aggregating customers for financial trades. The 6 shown in the image below were the 6 firms listed in the “Power Trading Schematic” updated late in 2014 . As noted, these firms have tended to come and go over time – and there are concerns, in an environment of low volatility (and liquidity down from the heyday of 2007) whether there are too many brokers. At the retail end of the market, I’ve been interested to see a growing number of retail energy brokers hang out their shingle, seeking to provide energy broking services to larger commercial and industrial energy users . Some are quite large, well-established companies – whilst the largest percentage seem to be small-sized enterprises (even sole traders), many recently established by people who were formerly energy retail salespeople. Using their position of influence (as “trusted advisor” to energy users) I started to think about what “value-add” services some might offer to capitalise on their role as an aggregator of energy procurement managers concerned about cost of energy for their enterprises. Additions include types of services such as energy audits and the like – but also, more recently, the inclusion of on-site generation options. Cogeneration has proved not commercially compelling in many cases, but with growing concerns about emissions this has meant a more favourable business case and the reduced cost of solar also potentially makes that attractive. Hence, in this sense, the retail broker not only aggregates C&I energy users for delivery to traditional energy retailers, the aggregation can also serve other suppliers of technology or services. Continuing down the supply chain to the residential and small commercial customer end, we have also seen a steady increase in the number of comparison sites offering to be an energy user’s next best friend in making them feel more comfortable about their energy procurement arrangements. In the following image I have listed some of those I know about, but it’s an area of the industry that’s rapidly evolving, so there are bound to be others you know of… As noted on the slide, some of the marketing I have seen tends to imply that these comparison sites will deliver the lowest cost of energy (with the inference potentially being by the energy user that it’s absolutely the lowest), but I suspect one would have to read the fine print to understand that what’s actually being delivered would be a relatively low price – relative to the sub-set of available offers considered (with perhaps preference shown, in some cases, to a particular comparison sites’ favoured retailer)… At the end of the day, given the relatively low “share of wallet” for residential user energy bill, and the “out of sight, out of mind” nature of the commodity being purchased, I wonder whether most would even really care if they understood the limitations in this approach? For completeness, the three government-provided services (one in Victoria and one in Queensland, plus a national service elsewhere) are highlighted in the box. Aggregating Data The electricity supply industry has always been one reliant on a large amount of frequently changing data to manage the balance between supply and demand. Traditionally, the “big data” has been mostly concentrated at the wholesale end of the industry, with old-style accumulation meters satisficing further down at the retail end. Even in that paradigm, another category of aggregator was formed with the establishment of the Meter Data Agent, as a responsibility distinct to retailing and distribution. In practice, most MDAs operate under the same form of branding as “the usual suspect” retailers/DNSPs, but some subsidiaries are (at least) branded separately from the network arms. Moving into a “Smart-Grid” world, and with the “Internet of Things” just around the corner, the escalating load of data might easily become deafening noise, if not for the ability that some companies are exploring to mine the masses of customer consumption data to turn it into something useful (i.e. aggregated insights). Feeding these insights into techniques to help achieve desirable outcomes (such as moderating peak demand) are the types of objectives that might be a focus. I am aware that Opower has appointed local Australian staff but am not sure about the other two US companies listed. There are probably other local companies that operate in the same space (please let us know who you are!) Reversing the flow of the data, we come to an illustration of what is part of our business model – in that we aggregate data from a number of different sources, then present it in clear displays to help people make time-sensitive decisions relating to trading, operations, business development and energy policy etc… As time permits, we try to share some insights with you on WattClarity as another service in making complexity more understandable. Aggregating Eyeballs. Thinking back to the way the electricity industry was a decade or more ago, the general public really didn’t care to know too much at all – so long as the lights stayed on, and the power bill was not a surprise. Some days we might say that that part has not changed too much – but is that really the case? Raised awareness of the environment, emergent technologies being more up the community “excitement scale”, and the growing social media ecosystem are combining to give everyone the opportunity to feel like an armchair expert – weighing into debate and discussion about an energy sector that would have, a decade or more ago, triggered mass narcolepsy had it been spoken about at the neighbourhood barbeque. Even within the NEM, where there used to be a limited number of organisations (like the QEC, ECNSW, SECV, ETSA and HydroTas), there’s now a great number more – each with their own policy, strategy and operations people. What this has seemed to mean is an increase in the number of media organisations springing up, providing avenues for the aggregation of eyeballs (or bodies, in the case of conference companies) – focused specifically on the energy sector. The services pulling the biggest audiences seem to be attractive targets for energy-sector-specific advertising, and related models. Aggregating “NegaWatts”. The last example I gave was one that has not formally started yet in the NEM – but which, following the submission of this rule change request by the COAG Energy Council to the AEMC in March 2015 , should be implemented when the process has worked through: As noted in the image above, I previously posted some thoughts about the unfortunate naming of the both the “Demand Response Mechanism”, and the unfortunate naming of the new type of market participant that is to be created – the “Demand Response Aggregator”. For those interested, these other thoughts might also be useful . We’ll continue to watch with interest as the new rule is implemented and swings into action. At the conclusion of the brain-storming session in preparation for this brief talk, I came to the clear realisation that there is plenty of opportunity present in many different niches for new and old forms of “aggregators” . The above are some of those that I have had time to post about today…",

    "date": "20-04-2015 01:43:00 PM",
    "content": "On RenewEconomy here, a snapshot from NEM-Watch aggregating large-scale solar for NSW was used to illustrate the increased output (I’d supplied this image to Giles following earlier reports of the increase in capacity at the plant). It was the weekend so I did not check the details , and it was not until today that I noticed another development coincident in the solar space – the AEMO is now publishing metered generation output for the Royalla solar project (6 months after it opened) along with Nyngan. This makes a grand total of 2 large-scale solar plants whose outputs are published by the AEMO, so far. Here’s how a longer-term trend looks in our NEM-Review software (which enables the user to dissect generation by fuel type into its individual elements): Note the most recent 3 days in the trend, showing how Royalla is the “little brother” to the larger Nyngan project, even with Nyngan not yet at its full load. Peak output over these three days, according to this metered generation data, was just 15.5MW – well below the 30MW threshold at which AEMO requires registration, so presumably included into the AEMO data set (and passed through to NEM-Review automatically) because of the groundswell of interest in solar (large and small). Also noted on the image, I’ve illustrated two different price “blips” (to call them “spikes” hardly does justice to the most volatile commodity market in the world): 1) On Monday 23rd March we have morning and evening price blips that almost exactly straddle the output pattern of Nyngan; and 2) On Thursday 16th April we have a price blip that appears to coincide better with peak output times for the solar station. Zooming in (shown below) we see some how the price blip coincided with a drop in output at Nyngan (presumably because of some cloud cover). We have not investigated further to see about other contributing factors (but are sure there will have been some): As with all generation types, we’ll continue watching (through our NEM-Watch and NEM-Review software) with great interest – and publishing (on WattClarity ), as time permits. Note that this Royalla data feed was automatically picked up and included in the “NSW Large Scale Solar” metric published in NEM-Watch (sample shown below) and on this NEM-Watch widget on RenewEconomy : With reference to Giles’ article here , the appearance of Royalla is the reason why it appeared (as it did not occur to me that Royalla had appeared in the data) that “managed to produce above its nominal capacity – to 65MW on Sunday morning.”",

    "content": "All good things come to an end – and today I am able to identify to whom we award that 6th and final consolation prize for summer 2014-15 – this portable barbeque: Today the focus is Queensland (Competition #2), and earlier today I posted this analysis of what happened with peak Queensland demand . Hence the main thing that remains to do is to congratulate Peter Sherman, from (QLD generator) InterGen , as he was only 9MW above the actual peak with the closest entry of many we received! Recapping the winners This means that our competition table stands as follows: Competition #1 {The Main Prize} Peak NEM-Wide Demand for the “extended summer” period Demand did not even rise above 30,000MW – which surprised us, and most of our entrants (as we discussed here ). The winner, as announced on Tuesday 7th April , was energy-sector lawyer, Connor James. Competition #2 {Consolation} Peak Queensland Demand for the same period Today we discussed how peak Queensland demand (8,892MW) was very close to an all-time record – a record which I would expect will be broken in the following summer period. The winner, as announced here today was Peter Sherman of InterGen. Competition #3 {Consolation} Peak NSW Demand for the same period On Monday 13th April we highlighted how the NSW peak demand was 3,000MW shy of the all-time record . The winner, as announced here on that day was Jeremy Machet, an energy-focused student. Competition #4 {Consolation} Peak Victoria Demand for the same period In Victoria the peak demand was almost 2,000MW below the peaks achieved in other years – as discussed here . The winner, as announced here on Thursday 9th April was Elijah Pack from the AEMO. Competition #5 {Consolation} Peak South Australia Demand for the same period This past summer, the South Australian demand did not break 3,000MW – and, indeed, for only a small number of days was it above 2,000MW. Not daunted by this challenge, the winner ( as announced here on Friday 10th April ) was Cameron Butler from Energy Price Solutions. Competition #6 {Consolation} Peak Tasmania Demand for the same period Tasmania is normally a winter peaking region (the only one, these days), so picking the winter peak demand might be thought of as somewhat “easier” than for mainland regions – though not without its own challenges. On Tuesday 14th April we posted this analysis of peak Tassie demand . The winner, as announced on that day was Reinhard Struve, from a Government Department (though in a “foreign” region!). Competition #7{Consolation} Peak Aggregate NEM-Wide Wind Production for the same period On Thursday 16th April we highlighted how wind output peaked up at 2,848MW . The winner, as announced here today (Thursday 16th April ) was Elijah Pack from the AEMO, who was closest to the mark. That wraps up our summer competitions for this year.

    "title": "Queensland’s peak demand very close to a new record – more possible next summer?",
    "date": "17-04-2015 10:54:00 AM",
    "content": "With 7 competitions run over summer, it’s taken a while to cycle through them all and to post about what’s happened through summer with respect to all 7 metrics. Leaving the best region to last (we live here, so we’re biased) we finally come to look at Queensland’s demand patterns today. 1) What actually eventuated? For one last time in this series, we power up NEM-Review to produce this trend of demand over the summer: Note, with this chart, that the pricing scale (y1 axis) is shown in log form because of the remarkable volatility seen in Queensland over summer 2014-15 – unlike other regions, but similar to what’s happened in 2013-14 and 2012-13 especially (i.e. summers where actions possible following the “3-into-2 generator merger” combined with other factors to make it possible). As noted, Queensland’s peak demand over this period was a massive 8,892MW at 16:50 on Thursday 6th* March 2015 (* oops 5th, thanks Richard) – and that this peak demand was only 52MW off the all-time record. As it happens, we were actually watching the market closely on that day, so were able to publish this analysis at the time of what happened . As noted there, this peak demand would have been considerably higher (probably a new all-time record) if it had not been for injections of power behind the meter from distributed small-scale PV, even though those injections were declining rapidly so late in the day (and were completely gone when demand rose again early that evening to almost register a new peak). 2) How well was this expected? This summer, in conjunction with our traditional “main prize”, we also offered to give away a “consolation prize” for the closest to the market at guesstimating what the peak demand would be for the Queensland region (this was Competition #2 of a total of 7 competitions this summer ). 2a) Was it expected, by our competition entrants? Collating all the entries and plotting a distribution, we see this pattern: As I did for Tasmania, I used a 100MW step for the distribution curve – much finer grained than for the other 3 regions because of the “less peaky” nature of Queensland demand. As can be seen, the actual peak demand surprised most of our entrants. SO WHO WINS THE “CONSOLATION” PRIZE FOR COMPETITION #2 (QLD PEAK) THIS SUMMER? All good give-aways come to an end, so the last winner of the consolation prize (their new portable BBQ prize, from Barbeques Galore), is revealed here… We did see a few courageous entries further up the scale, including entries above 9,000MW – perhaps a summer too early? 2b) Was it expected, by AEMO? On 24th December, I posted these tips about what might be expected in Queensland’s peak demand for summer . We also published this tip about how you might use NEM-Watch to reference the AEMO’s forecast for peak summer demand , in the context of current market action. For ease of reference, this image is copied here: Just eyeballing this chart, we see that the actual level achieved (8,892MW) was at the upper end of the AEMO’s forecasts for Queensland this summer – i.e. a High Economic Growth scenario, and a 10% POE weather shape (i.e. extreme weather). It was certainly hot on that day! 3) Looking in more detail? As we did for other regions last week, we include this trend of the headline stats for QLD for the “5 hot months” of 2014-15 and the 6 preceding financial years: Unlike what we saw for all four other regions, we see that all three metrics in Queensland increase for summer 2014-15 . To provide more detail, we generated the following distribution curve for QLD: With respect to this curve, a few key points are evident: 3a) Minimum demand As illustrated by the zig-zag arrow on the chart above, all-hours demand (at the bottom end of the curve – shown as Area 1) has increased significantly from 2013-14 to 2014-15 as electricity used in upstream compression of CSG supplies for LNG export has reversed the smaller decline seen over several summers. 3b) Afternoon demand In the afternoon demand part of the curve (shown as Area 2) we see that, like other regions, solar PV (amongst other factors) had been successful in reducing afternoon demand – especially because Queensland had been boom town for solar developments, at least in part because of: 1. Better solar yield than the southern regions; and 2. A very generous, long-lived 44c feed in tariff that encouraged something like 400,000 residential customers to sign up ( including me ). However these reductions have been almost fully reversed over the past 12 months with the increase in industrial use of electricity. Demand is trending back towards the levels last seen in the “all-time max” summer of 2009-10. 3c) Peak demand Zooming in on the peak end of the curve, whilst keeping in mind that Queensland is much less peaky than regions like Victoria and South Australia, we see the following cumulative distribution: In this chart we can see how Queensland’s peak demand shape was much flatter in 2014-15 than it was in 2009-10, and yet we know (from the above) that the actual peak demand achieved in 2014-15 was only 52MW off the all-time record. In a market where peak capacity* is funded by payments made per MWh (as opposed to being made per MW) this is a significant – and, evidently, growing – challenge . * The “peak capacity” I refer to here is both network, and energy supply. 4) Looking ahead to summer 2015-16 Over the past 2 weeks in writing this series of articles, I have been asked by a number of people – what it means for the future . I’ll note some observations quickly here for Queensland, and return to this later – as time permits…. In the past 2 weeks we’ve walked around the NEM and seen a very clear picture (at least this summer) of a tale of two very different markets: 1. SOUTH of the border, we’ve seen regions where peak demand disappointed and, as a result, prices barely budged off “boring” . We’ve also seen how moderate weather has been the biggest contributor to this. 2. NORTH of the border, however, we’ve seen the continuation of the summer volatility that we’ve been seeing each summer since 2012-13, following behaviour made possible by the 3-into-2 merger (which was created as a way of staunching the red ink assaulting the state government’s finances). This has been partially possible due to peak (and average) demand remaining resilient – and rebounding – compared to its southern cousins. It does make me wonder what might be the case come summer 2015-16 after three big changes are made: 4a) Demand is higher still in Queensland Upstream electric compression still has a way to run – we keep a keen eye on this through the Powerlink data fed through our ez2view software . We wrote about a mysterious jump in Queensland demand as we believe current explanations only tell part of the story, and offered to dig further, but it did not make it to the top of our priority list. By next summer, we expect many more 100MWs of upstream demand to be functional. Hence, it’s reasonable to assume average demand will be higher next summer and, depending on what happens with the weather, we may well see a new demand peak set in 2015-16. 4b) Conversely, gas generation slides further down For the same reason, but on the other side of the coin, it seems almost certain that gas generation will wind back further in the sunshine state as all available supplies are corralled into tankers on their way to Asia. This has already begun, as shown here in the trended monthly average production from selected gas-fired generation across Queensland (again from NEM-Review ): With this will come a significant tightening of available supplies – especially independent supplies not owned by Stanwell and CS Energy, the dominant government-owned generators. 4c) 3-into-2 becomes 2-into-1? We’re not sure if this will happen yet, but it still seems a possibility, despite reservations being raised by a number of people, including the ACCC. The 3-into-2 merger unlocked possibilities for the 2 dominant portfolios to deliver market volatility in summer 2012-13 – and so increase average spot prices (which flowed through to the forward curve). Since 2012-13, we have seen 2013-14 and now 2014-15 similarly volatile – though not to the same extent, I think. What kind of pain would we see in 2015-16, with a 2-into-1 merger likely to deliver so much more of the same? Sitting on the outside, looking in, this does call to mind those famous words of Sir Humphrey Appleby in advising Minister Jim Hacker about what would have been “a very brave decision” to create a “StanCS” monster in an environment where demand is increasing, and competition evaporating. Of course, the silver lining in all of this (for some) might be what it does to “democratised” renewables in Queensland . I can picture the advertising now – “ buy your solar now to hedge against the price rises as the “big, bad, monopoly generator” runs rough-shod over the spot market and drives your power bills higher”. Might return Queensland solar to the boom-time sales trajectory, and without the added cost of the generous 44c feed-in-tariff of yesteryear? Problem is, it would also be “creative advertising”, and may even exacerbate the situation, with peak demand shifting later in the day – and even, potentially, to after the sun’s gone down – as shown in this example here . As a keen market observer, we will continue to watch with interest what happens, moving forwards – however this is not without a degree of trepidation in terms of how the outcomes that emerge might effect our organisations such as our clients, on all stages down the supply chain. Being a unashamed fan of the Sunshine state, and it facing some very big imminent challenges (like those above), we will be particularly watchful of what happens here, moving forwards….",

    "date": "16-04-2015 07:00:00 AM",
    "content": "Continuing with our series of competitions today, we assembled the entries to see who was closest to the mark in predicting peak wind output over summer 2014-15, and so who wins this portable barbeque: This was Competition #7, and earlier today I posted this analysis of what happened with wind output as it’s grown in contribution over the past 7 summers. Hence the main thing that remains to do is to congratulate Elijah Pack, from the AEMO , as he was only 1MW below the actual peak with the closest entry of many we received! Astute observers will note that this is Elijah’s second win of the series – and note that winning 2 prizes is something that’s perfectly fine under the Fine Print for the competition . We know he has good homes in mind for each of his prizes! Recapping the winners This means that our competition table stands as follows: Competition #1 {The Main Prize} Peak NEM-Wide Demand for the “extended summer” period Demand did not even rise above 30,000MW – which surprised us, and most of our entrants (as we discussed here ). The winner, as announced on Tuesday 7th April , was energy-sector lawyer, Connor James. Competition #2 {Consolation} Peak Queensland Demand for the same period The winner is still to be declared… Competition #3 {Consolation} Peak NSW Demand for the same period On Monday (13th April) we highlighted how the NSW peak demand was 3,000MW shy of the all-time record. The winner, as announced here was Jeremy Machet, an energy-focused student. Competition #4 {Consolation} Peak Victoria Demand for the same period In Victoria the peak demand was almost 2,000MW below the peaks achieved in other years – as discussed here . The winner, as announced here on Thursday 9th April was Elijah Pack from the AEMO. Competition #5 {Consolation} Peak South Australia Demand for the same period This past summer, the South Australian demand did not break 3,000MW – and, indeed, for only a small number of days was it above 2,000MW. Not daunted by this challenge, the winner ( as announced here on Friday 10th April ) was Cameron Butler from Energy Price Solutions. Competition #6 {Consolation} Peak Tasmania Demand for the same period Tasmania is normally a winter peaking region (the only one, these days), so picking the winter peak demand might be thought of as somewhat “easier” than for mainland regions – though not without its own challenges. On Tuesday 14th April we posted this analysis of peak Tassie pseudo-summer demand . The winner, as announced on that day was Reinhard Struve, from a Government Department (though in a “foreign” region!). Competition #7{Consolation} Peak Aggregate NEM-Wide Wind Production for the same period Today (Thursday 16th April) we highlighted how wind output peaked up at 2,848MW . The winner, as announced here today (Thursday 16th April ) was Elijah Pack from the AEMO , who was closest to the mark. Stay tuned to learn of the remaining winner – for peak Queensland demand…",

    "title": "Wind Peak Production climbs – linearly over 5 successive summers",
    "date": "16-04-2015 06:45:00 AM",
    "content": "This summer, we ran 7 separate competitions, asking entrants to forecast (for the first 6) peak demand across the NEM and/or in each of the NEM regions. For the 7th competition, given it’s of increasing importance in a number of ways, we asked entrants to forecast peak aggregate wind output across the NEM over the 4-month “Extended Summer” period. Today we have a look at what actually happened. 1) What actually eventuated? To provide an overview of what happened in terms of wind output, we once again reach for NEM-Review to produce this trend: As can be expected, given the nature of wind production, the pattern is more random than what we have been seeing with the daily load pattern for the regions studied to date (NEM-wide demand shown shaded behind). We see wind production drop below 100MW on occasions, and reach up towards the 3,000MW mark. Hence we’ve simplified the analysis in NEM-Review by showing only the daily extremes over the 120 days of the study period: Highlighted in this chart is the peak in wind output of 2,848MW in the 17:30 and 17:35 dispatch intervals on Tuesday 16th December (so roughly coincident with evening peak in demand on that occasion). 2) How well was this expected? In Competition #7 (of a total of 7 competitions this summer) we offered a “consolation prize” for the closest to the mark in forecasting what this peak would be. 2a) Did we expect this? Late in the summer period, I posted this article questioning why we’d not seen wind output as high as I’d been expecting it to be (because of the new farms coming online over summer). This followed from these tips posted when the competition was opened , illustrating how wind output (both average and peak) had climbed significantly from a zero base back in 2005. 2b) Was it expected, by our competition entrants? Collating all the entries and plotting a distribution, we see this pattern: As we can see, the peak wind production coincided nicely with the peak in the distribution of entries – which seems to indicate that peak wind output over summer was more predictable than forecasting peak demand for Victoria, South Australia or NSW (or NEM-wide). SO WHO WINS THE “CONSOLATION” PRIZE FOR COMPETITION #7 (PEAK WIND OUTPUT) THIS SUMMER? One person who can now be enjoying their new portable BBQ prize, from Barbeques Galore, is revealed here… Of ancillary interest to me were the entries we received from some far up on the right. Initially I thought that it might have been that these entrants did not understand what we were asking , but then an alternative explanation occurred as a possibility – perhaps, despite plentiful reports and media and social media coverage, there’s still lack of widespread understanding (even amongst the market participants, observers and commentators that read WattClarity and enter this competition) of how much wind production actually contributes to the energy mix of the NEM. Increasing the level of understanding about this, as another important metric relevant to the ongoing change in the NEM, was the reason we added a focus on wind production to our summer competition process (and why we have produced the NEM-Watch widget that’s hosted on RenewEconomy , for instance). 2c) Was it expected, by AEMO? For each of the regional peak demands, we’ve been able to look back at the AEMO’s forecasts (from the NEFR and the ESOO) of what peak regional demand will be. I don’t know of any such forecast provided by AEMO (so far ahead), of what the extremes of wind output are likely to be in each region, or across the NEM. Hence it’s not possible for me to investigate that question any further. If you can point me to a reference from AEMO that would have helped in the lead-up to summer, please do. 3) Looking in more detail? As we have been doing for the other 6 (demand-related) competitions, we include this trend of the headline stats for Wind Production for the “5 hot months” of 2014-15 and the 6 preceding financial years: As can be clearly seen, the (inclining & regular) trends shown here for wind production are very different from the trends shown: (a) for average and minimum demand (declining, and reasonably regular) and (b) for peak demand (much more irregular) in three regions shown to date – NSW , VIC , and SA . To provide more detail, we generated the following distribution curve for NEM-wide wind production: With respect to this curve, a few key points are evident: 3a) Minimum output As shown in the summary stats above, the minimum output from wind farms aggregated across the NEM has remained (and could perhaps always remain?) stuck around 0MW. This could potentially have significant implications to the cost of energy supply in the future, depending on how penetration rates increase and what replaces existing thermal plant when it closes. I previously discussed “doomsday predictions” for security of supply , touching on this issue. 3b) Median output As highlighted in the chart, we see the median output increasing fairly* steadily at the same time as the spread of output grows, and hence the incidence at the median output naturally declines. * Note that I said fairly steady as you’ll see that median output actually fell from 2013-14 and 2014-15 at the same time as the curve widened. I’m guessing this was due to the most recent 5 months being less windy (in the wind farm catchment areas) than the prior period, but wonder if someone can confirm for our readers? 3c) Peak output As with the analysis for peak demand at each region, we produce an aggregate distribution curve up the peak end – though it is a little arbitrary what we define as “peak” over 7 summers, given the rapid increase in capacity: In the chart shown here, we can see a reasonably uniform year-on-year growth in output at the peak end of the curve. With wind continuing to grow as an energy source for the NEM (though not to the extent we expected to see in terms of peak output this summer!) we will continue to watch with interest – in NEM-Watch and NEM-Review – what unfolds into the future….",

    "title": "A review of temperatures for summer 2014-15",
    "date": "15-04-2015 01:44:00 PM",
    "content": "Looking back on Summer 2014-15, peak electricity demand generally came in below most people’s predictions . Editor’s Note – these predictions were reviewed here for NSW , Victoria , and South Australia – and predictions for Queensland yet to be published. Predictions for Tasmania were more on the money, but the region is not discussed in this article. With peak daily demand strongly correlated to peak daily temperatures during the summer months, it is worth a look at how this summer’s temperatures fared. One benchmark is to compare this summer to the previous one. Focussing on the NEM’s major population centres, Brisbane and Sydney can draw a close comparison to last summer, while it is safe to say that this summer had little in comparison to the heat-filled Summer 2013-14 for Melbourne and Adelaide. But this shies away from focussing on the real issue: extreme heat. Was this year really as lacklustre in terms of extreme temperatures as it would appear? Let’s take a closer look, specifically looking at the last 10 summers across the NEM. Brisbane If there is one place that saw its fair share of extreme heat this summer, it is Brisbane . Frequent hot spells struck the region, with many days seeing heat persist well into the afternoon and occasionally even into the evening hours. Taking a look at Archerfield Airport specifically, extreme heat was no stranger this summer. In fact, Archerfield Airport managed to hit 35 degrees on 11 occasions this summer, more than twice as many as the average over the last 10 years . The graph below aims to dissect the extreme heat of the last ten summer seasons (October to March). Each line represents a single summer, and its plotted values represent how many days surpassed any specific temperature during that summer. This graph can be used to see if any given year, including the summer that has just finished, behaved similarly or differently to any other given year, as well as if it was above or below average when compared to the last ten years. There are two distinct observations that emerge about this year’s extreme temperatures at Archerfield Airport: · Its strong similarity to Summer 2013-14’s extreme heat distribution · the abnormally large number of days that climbed into the mid-30s. Sydney I have chosen the observation site of Bankstown Airport AWS as the most representative for the Sydney region for this analysis. As you can see below, this summer was a very middle-of-the-road one for Australia’s largest metropolitan area. There are three years that stick out as going against the grain, and were three years that were heavily influenced by El Nino / La Nina events. Similar to the graph for Brisbane, this is an indication of the importance of predicting this Pacific Ocean phenomenon, particularly La Nina events, when attempting to foresee eastern Australia summer temperatures. One thing to note about this summer was the abundance of warm days that occurred very early in the summer period and were notably lacking in humidity ; a fact that was mimicked by the previous summer as well. While temperature is able to explain a large portion of the story behind electricity demand, humidity is a second factor that cannot be ignored. Melbourne It will come as no surprise to many that this summer’s temperatures were below average for Melbourne no matter how you look at it. Contrasting this summer with the one prior, they were polar opposites. If looking for a summer to compare with, Summer 2011-12 comes quite close. Temperatures struggled to climb much above 35 degrees on most occasions, and the CBD failed to reach the 40 degree mark, an occurrence that hasn’t happened since Summer 2004-05. Unlike Brisbane and Sydney, Melbourne’s summer weather is not as driven by El Nino and La Nina events . Indeed, some La Nina years have proven to be above average in temperature for Melbourne, and vice versa with El Nino events. There are other more complex factors that come into play when it comes to forecasting extreme weather in Melbourne. There were early indications that Melbourne’s summer would fall into the cooler-than-normal category. Extreme heat predictions for the NEM’s major population centres usually start with Australia’s interior and how it will interact with the weather systems that track across the country over the summer months. Climate models consistently suggested that Australia’s interior heat would be largely sent eastward, as strong westerly wind anomalies were predicted. This meant above-normal bouts of heat for eastern Australia, particularly for Queensland. In stark contrast to Summer 2013-14, this also meant a lack of heat events for the southern NEM – especially for Melbourne – as there would not be the strong low pressure systems to drag the heat southward. In a nutshell, it was predicted that Melbourne would be robbed of summer heat, and instead it would be given to Brisban e. This forecast turned out to be quite accurate. Adelaide Adelaide’s Kent Town observation site came in below average this summer , but only by a fraction . Last summer’s plentiful heat is well observed on the graph above, with 11 days climbing above 42 degrees. That is compared to only two days reaching the same mark this summer. Seasonal Forecasting The main topic of discussion leading up to this past summer was the high likelihood of an El Nino event affecting this summer’s temperatures. This summer’s El Nino event was weaker than most computer model’s predictions , but MetraWeather also take other factors into account when predicting extreme temperatures in advance, and we’re really happy with how our seasonal forecast performed for this summer’s overall pattern of extreme weather. Conclusion Summer 2014-15 saw a near average amount of extreme temperatures across the NEM , with Brisbane seeing more than its fair share of extreme heat at the expense of Melbourne. This was hidden by the fact that the previous summer had an unusually large number of extreme heat days in all major population centres with the exception of Sydney. This analysis also shows quite clearly that the likelihood of a La Nina event is the strongest predictor of summer temperatures, particularly for Brisbane and Sydney . While not all La Nina events have translated to below normal summers, almost all below normal summers in the last 10 years have been La Nina years.

    "title": "Tassie’s “summer” demand peak comes with cold weather?",
    "date": "14-04-2015 06:42:00 AM",
    "content": "Over the past two weeks, we have walked through 4 of 7 metrics to ascertain what the extremes have been in terms of demand, and wind production. That leaves 3 still to go. Turning to one of our favourite destinations, we look at what happened in Tasmania over the “extended summer” period 2014-15. 1) What actually eventuated? Returning to NEM-Review , we produce this trend of Tasmanian region scheduled demand over the 4-month period: Of interest to us is the fact that the demand peak occurred towards the end of what we defined as “extended summer” (on 26th March) and at 6:50 in the morning – so we’re inferring that early-morning heating might have been a contributing factor on that day (see how neighbouring days were also higher demand). If this is true, we have an “extended summer” peak demand of 1,389MW occurring at a time when it was cold enough for heating to push demand higher. I’ve also highlighted on the chart two obvious instances where system technical issues resulted in the trip of significant amounts of Tassie demand (including some major industrial loads). We did find at least one other, in a quick inspection of the data (this was in the middle of the day, so is not as obvious in the above). There may have been other occasions. Keep this in mind when looking at the minimum demands below! 2) How well was this expected? This summer, in conjunction with our traditional “main prize”, we also offered to give away a “consolation prize” for the closest to the market at guesstimating what the peak demand would be for the TAS region (this was Competition #6 of a total of 7 competitions this summer ). 2a) Was it expected, by our competition entrants? Collating all the entries and plotting a distribution, we see this pattern: With reference to the above, keep in mind that I have used small (100MW) steps in the distribution curve and, even with these small steps, we find the actual peak demand coincided with the high point in the distribution curve. Hence we could conclude from this that the peak demand in Tasmania is much more predictable than in any of the other competitions we’ve seen to date. A glance at the chart above, which shows much less variation in demand from week-to-week than the other regions, illustrates why. Hence, in terms of entries, this one came much more down to the wire. SO WHO WINS THE “CONSOLATION” PRIZE FOR COMPETITION #6 (TAS PEAK) THIS SUMMER? One person who proved adept at taking heating into account in forecasting peak demand in Tasmania over this early-morning period (and so can enjoy their new portable BBQ prize, from Barbeques Galore), is revealed here… We see a small percentage of entries trailing off to the right in the distribution, including some above 2,000MW. However in general terms the entries were clustered tightly around what actually happened. 2b) Was it expected, by AEMO? On New Year’s Eve, I posted these tips about summer peak demand in Tasmania – to help entrants sharpen their pencils and put in their best entries. Included in these tips was this image highlighting AEMO’s forecasts for peak Tassie demand – shown in conjunction with current demand data: As noted in the image, Tasmania is (unlike the other 4 northern regions now) distinctly winter-peaking. One of our entrants pointed out when making his entry that, because we extended our definition of summer to include March, we left open the possibility of a cooler period late in March delivering higher demand than had been experienced in the three regular months or summer. That’s what’s seemed to happen. 3) Looking in more detail? As we did for other regions last week, we include this trend of the headline stats for TAS for the “5 less cold(?) months” of 2014-15 and the 6 preceding financial years: As noted in this chart, the effect of the tripping of a significant proportion of load (500MW or so, on occasions) can be clearly seen in the suppression of minimum demand for 2014-15. It should be noted, as well, that I did not check the prior years to see if the same thing had happened. Compared to the same chart for South Australia or Victoria , we can see that the average demand in Tasmania is much more evenly spaced between maximum and minimum (i.e. Tasmania is much less peaky – again contributing to the ease of forecast). To provide more detail, we generated the following distribution curve for TAS: With respect to this curve, we can see that it is almost a natural bell curve (at least, much more the case than is the case for the other regions we have looked at). The three areas highlighted still apply: 3a) Minimum demand Down at the bottom end of the curve (marked “Area 1”) we see a shift in the demand pattern occurring between 2009-10 and 2010-11 – and, further up the curve, between 2010-11 and 2011-12. I am not familiar enough with the Tasmanian region to hazard a guess as to what this might be – it might have resulted from a combination of a number of initiatives, such as: 1. More efficient street lighting; and 2. Better insulation Right down the bottom end of the curve, it does not seem that there has been much change at all in the demand pattern (for minimum demand) over 7 years. 3b) Afternoon demand Up in the area of afternoon demand (marked “Area 2”) we see a more distinctive pattern of change, beginning 2009-10. Whilst solar PV will have been one of the factors, the installed capacity in Tasmania is relatively small (and harvesting not so great, at the southern end of the country) – so I can only think that there will have been other factors at work. Perhaps some of our readers can suggest? 3c) Peak demand As noted above, Tasmania is much less peaky than the other regions we’ve looked at to date. For completeness, however, we include the same chart, focused on the higher end of the demand curve: As noted on the graphic, we can see a significant drop in the curve from 2008-09 to 2014-15 which (if seen on its own) might give cause for some to believe that the peak demand challenge had been tamed. However the much more similar load shape between 2008-09 and 2013-14 (5 years apart) implies that the challenge still remains, ready for weather extremes to unleash it again.

This morning I posted this analysis of what happened to NSW demand (including peak demand) over the summer period , highlighting how (just like in Victoria and South Australia) hotter summer weather did not arrive, and so demand stayed moderate. Hence the main thing that remains to do is to congratulate Jeremy Machet (and energy-focused student) , as he was only 5MW above the actual peak with the closest entry of many we received! Recapping the winners This means that our competition table stands as follows: Competition #1 {The Main Prize} Peak NEM-Wide Demand for the “extended summer” period Demand did not even rise above 30,000MW – which surprised us, and most of our entrants (as we discussed here ). The winner, as announced on Tuesday 7th April , was energy-sector lawyer, Connor James. Competition #2 {Consolation} Peak Queensland Demand for the same period The winner is still to be declared… Competition #3 {Consolation} Peak NSW Demand for the same period Today (Monday 13th April) we highlighted how the NSW peak demand was 3,000MW shy of the all-time record. The winner, as announced here today is Jeremy Machet, an energy-focused student. Competition #4 {Consolation} Peak Victoria Demand for the same period In Victoria the peak demand was almost 2,000MW below the peaks achieved in other years – as discussed here . The winner, as announced here on Thursday 9th April is Elijah Pack from the AEMO. Competition #5 {Consolation} Peak South Australia Demand for the same period This past summer, the South Australian demand did not break 3,000MW – and, indeed, for only a small number of days was it above 2,000MW. Not daunted by this challenge, the winner ( as announced here on Friday 10th April ) was Cameron Butler from Energy Price Solutions.

    "title": "Similarly, the NSW summer demand peak failed to arrive",
    "date": "13-04-2015 08:10:00 AM",
    "content": "Last week I was able to post some analysis of very modest demand peaks seen in Victoria and South Australia across the summer 2014-15, and across the whole of the NEM . Today I provide the same sort of analysis for the NSW region. Given the NEM-wide peak was so low, I began this analysis with an expectation that the peak demand for NSW would be reasonably low, as well. 1) What actually eventuated? To provide an overview of what happened over summer in NSW, we once again reach for NEM-Review to produce this trend: On this chart we have highlighted how the demand peaked to a level of 11,395MW on 23rd January , which was one day following the peak in Victoria for this summer . We see only 2 other days where demand rose above 11,000MW, and 22 more (out of 120 in total) where demand even rose above 10,000MW. Hence this confirmed our expectation that the data would show a low demand summer. 2) How well was this expected? This summer, in conjunction with our traditional “main prize”, we also offered to give away a “consolation prize” for the closest to the market at guesstimating what the peak demand would be for the NSW region (this was Competition #3 of a total of 7 competitions this summer ). 2a) Was it expected, by our competition entrants? Collating all the entries and plotting a distribution, we see this pattern: As we can see, the demand peak underwhelmed 90% of our entries . The bulk of the entries fit in a 2,000MW range beginning 11,500MW and ranging up to 13,500MW. SO WHO WINS THE “CONSOLATION” PRIZE FOR COMPETITION #3 (NSW PEAK) THIS SUMMER? One person who probably does not mind the fact that demand was on the low side in NSW this summer – and so increased the likelihood that their low-range entry in the competition would stand a chance, is the one who will be enjoying their new portable BBQ prize, from Barbeques Galore as revealed here… One other point to note is the large range of entries compared to other regions (particularly Tasmania and Queensland) – illustrating a higher degree of uncertainty of even how many thousands of MW the peak demand will be each summer in NSW. 2b) Was it expected, by AEMO? During the (slow Christmas and New Year) weeks when the 7 competitions were open to entrants, we posted some tips about most of the 7 – but did not find time to post any tips about NSW. However on 28th January (i.e. after the peak summer demand had been reached – it turns out) I did post about how forecasting peak summer demand would be harder than it might have originally seemed . In that post, I included a snapshot of NEM-Watch highlighting what the AEMO had been forecasting for peak summer demand under each of their 9 different scenarios – this is copied below for ease of reference: Reading off this chart, it appears that the 11,395MW level was at the very bottom end of the AEMO’s range of expectations (i.e. a scenario loosely described as “very mild summer”, and with with poor economic conditions as well). No wonder we’d not seen the NSW region colour scaling not budge out of the blue/green zone in our NEM-Watch dashboard running 24×7 in the office over the whole of summer! 3) Looking in more detail? As we did for other regions last week, we include this trend of the headline stats for NSW for the “5 hot months” of 2014-15 and the 6 preceding financial years: As indicated on this chart, we actually found instances of higher demand in NSW occurring in November 2014 (so out-of-scope for our competition ) than actually occurred during the “extended summer” period! Even with the added (400MW) uplift of the higher demand in November, we see that the demand peak in this 5-month period was similar to other cooler summers (2011-12 and 2013-14) and more than 2,000MW below the peaks reached in summers when the mercury rose! Also highlighted is the effect that can be clearly seen of the closure of the Kurri Kurri aluminium smelter during 2012 (with the final pin pulled in 2014). Other industrial plants have also closed (e.g. Caltex Kurnell refinery) but their average consumption was smaller. To provide more detail, we generated the following distribution curve for NSW: With respect to this curve, a few key points are evident: 3a) Minimum demand We can clearly seem in Area 1 marked at the bottom end of the curve, the most significant shift to the left registered from 2010-11 to 2011-12, and also from 2011-12 to 2012-13. This correlates with the closure of Kurri Kurri. 3b) Afternoon demand In Area 2, also marked on the chart, we can see that the curves equating to ordinary afternoon demand have seen the curve also shift to the left – to a larger degree, taking into account the compounding effect of industrial load closure but also the effect of other factors (like solar operating behind the meter during sunlight hours). In reading the chart, see that the most significant shift occurred from 2010-11 to 2011-12 at this end of the chart. 3c) Peak demand As with the other regions, the absolute measure of peak demand has been more random given the effect of weather extremes (and the variability of this). For a closer look we provide the same zoomed-in (and cumulative) focus at the section marked “Area 3” above: The miserable peak recorded for summer 2014-15 can be clearly seen on the chart. What particular stands out to me, however, is the amazingly “long tail” distribution of peak demand for the period Nov 2012 to December 2013 . To be clear, this was after* several hundred megawatts of demand at Kurri Kurri had been removed from the system. And yet the curve for 2012-13 reaches almost as high as the all-time record (2010-11), and is very, very flat – another indicator that the peak demand problem might be getting worse ? * it is noted here that “Hydro closed the Kurri Kurri plant’s remaining primary metal production in September 2012, and stopped producing casthouse products in October 2012.” Hence I believe this means that the Kurri Kurri load would not show up in data for 2012-13 shown in this analysis. As with all regions, we will watch with interest to see what happens in NSW, moving forwards.",

    "title": "South Australian peak demand this summer was a fizzer",
    "date": "10-04-2015 07:30:00 AM",
    "content": "Yesterday I posted some analysis of what happened in a lacklustre Victorian region this summer , in terms of peak demand. This followed from some analysis of broader patterns across the NEM . Today I recount a similar situation in neighbouring South Australia. 1) What actually eventuated? To provide an overview of what happened over summer in South Australia, we once again reach for NEM-Review to produce this trend over the four months we defined as “extended summer”: As noted on this chart, the peak demand in South Australia for summer 2014-15 was 2,784MW – achieved at 15:25 (NEM time) on Wednesday 7th January 2015. I note that this was actually 2 days prior to entries closing in our competition , so would have thought that this should have informed a number of the entries received in the 2 days following from that! Given that many businesses (and all schools) were still in holiday mode at that time, it was reasonable to expect that demand would have peaked higher than that level later in the summer – but this was not the case over this summer period, as shown above. Indeed we note that even moderately high demand was largely non-existent in South Australia this summer – with only 14 days out of 121 seeing scheduled demand even rise above 2,000MW ! Non-scheduled wind, and solar operating behind the meter, will both have had an effect, though we suspect that there are other factors that have played a significant role (such as the mild summer weather). 2) How well was this expected? This summer, in conjunction with our traditional “main prize”, we also offered to give away a “consolation prize” for the closest to the market at guesstimating what the peak demand would be for the South Australian region (this was Competition #5 of a total of 7 competitions this summer ). 2a) Was it expected, by our competition entrants? Collating all the entries and plotting a distribution, we see this distribution: As we can see, the majority of entries landed in the 3,000MW-3,500MW range (above where the peak demand landed this summer). There was also just less than 30% of entries in the 2,500MW-3,000MW range, within which the actual peak landed. Hence it’s fair to say that the level of peak demand achieved was not entirely unexpected – though below the majority of bids. SO WHO WINS THE “CONSOLATION” PRIZE FOR COMPETITION #5 (SA PEAK) THIS SUMMER? This is the second consolation prize we’re giving away for showing some talent (or luck?) – but definitely showing some initiative – and the winner is revealed here… Finally, we see that there were also a handful of entries well below this level – from the pessimistic sorts? 2b) Was it expected, by AEMO? Back on 29th December, when I posted these tips for entrants to competition #5 , I included a snapshot from NEM-Watch highlighting what the AEMO had said about what peak demand might be under the 3 different economic development scenarios, and the three different weather permutations. For ease of reference, here’s that image again: Just eye-balling this chart, it does appear that the actual demand peak of 2,784MW is below what the AEMO forecasted under a 50% POE (probability of exceedence) scenario but above the 90% POE scenario. Hence, in summary, the actual peak demand equates to what was expected to happen under pretty mild conditions. 3) Looking in more detail? Firstly (as we did with our analysis of NEM-wide & Victorian demand), we include this trend of the headline stats for South Australia for the “5 hot months” of 2014-15 and the 6 preceding financial years: Like in the case of Victoria, peak demand this summer was significantly down on what was achieved the prior year. Like in Victoria, there’s also a big gap between the peak demand and the average demand – indicating a significant degree of weather dependence on the demand at the peak end. We see peak demand is typically more than twice the average demand over these hot month periods. However what’s perhaps more striking, from this chart, is a massive 140MW (16%) drop in minimum demand over this period! To provide more detail, we generated the following distribution curve for South Australia: With respect to this curve, a few key points are evident – again in the 3 areas highlighted: 3a) At the bottom end of the curve (Area 1) In the “trended stats” chart above we see a significant drop in minimum demand seen from 2013-14 to 2014-15. In terms of the distribution, however, the most significant shift in the base-load demand a year earlier – with the change being obvious between the “hot months” of 2012-13 and 2013-14. Hence it seems that there was progressive closure of some continuously operating load in South Australia beginning July 2013, but that the closure did not complete until sometime in 2014-15 (when the minimum demand dropped). 1. I don’t recall the details of the timing of the closure of the various car manufacturing operations in South Australia (and I also wonder how much of the 140MW drop in minimum demand this would amount to, in any case). 2. We wonder if one of our readers can confirm if this is the result of some progressive closure of one (or more) major industrial loads ? 3b) With respect to “normal” afternoon demand (Area 2) As we saw for Victoria, and NEM-wide, there’s also a shift in the curve corresponding to the median afternoon demands – due both to whatever changes have caused the demand at the bottom end of the curve to disappear, and also the injection of solar PV behind the meter, netting off scheduled demand. With the shift of this part of the curve to the left, we can see why there were few days where demand rose above 2,000MW! Also of note is that the median incidence of demand (just like the average) has shifted below 1,500MW. This will have been due (at least in part) to the loss of whatever continuous (industrial?) demand was highlighted at the bottom of the curve. 3c) Peak demand (Area 3) As was the case for Victoria, and NEM-wide, we see that peak demand remains a separate issue – and one which, it seems, might be becoming a more vexed challenge at the same time as the “most hours” demand curve is being hollowed out. This is strikingly clear in the following chart: It seems clear, from this chart, that the lacklustre results for 2014-15 at this end of the curve don’t form part of a growing trend, but are more likely to be the result of a milder summer. As I have noted on this chart, in practical terms the curves for 2008-09 and 2013-14 are very similar – despite being 5 years apart and hence being separated by a significant number of developments in the energy market over this period, including: 1. Increases in retail price for electricity 2. Roll-out of significant volumes of solar PV in South Australia. 3. Continued roll-out of wind farms in South Australia. We’ve noted at other times ( such as here ) we’re a big fan – and a keen supporter – of Demand Response , in terms of what it can achieve for helping industrial energy users reduce their average cost of energy (whilst delivering a broader benefit to the energy sector, as well). However looking at the x-axis here, in relation to the charts above, the scale of the challenge for South Australia seems well beyond what demand response can address on its own . In simple terms we have a region where the average demand is 1,500MW and a median demand being somewhere below that – but a peak demand component of roughly that amount occurring, in most of the past 7 summers, for something like 3-5 days in total only! Switching off the majority of that “most times” demand in order to cater for an almost doubling of demand that occurs so infrequently some summers is clearly not a practical solution. Hence there needs to be some physical capacity to supply the bulk of that demand peak – and gas-fired generation has been the tool of choice in South Australia (and elsewhere) to date. However we note issues with this, moving forwards including: 1. An environment where gas prices look set to rise with demand increasing, but the supply-side restricted; and 2. Where gas-fired plant, like this one, are mooted to “possibly” close – though we did not the timing of this “might close” announcement coincided ☺with a spike in the debate about capacity payments (see these previous comments about capacity payments ). Certainly some interesting questions to be pondered, with respect to South Australia, moving forwards.",

Hence it was with interest that we progressed to investigating the Victorian demand in this post, to see the details of what happened over summer 2014-15. Having seen (from prior years) that NEM-wide peaks often accompany peaks in Victoria and South Australia, and knowing the NEM-wide peak was low, I was expecting a low Victorian peak (but I was still surprised by what I found). 1) What actually eventuated? That wasn’t the only reason I expected Victorian peak demand to be low. Having run NEM-Watch in our office for situational awareness over the course of this summer period, I had already been aware that this was a low-demand summer in Victoria – there had been plenty of green, and even blue colours observed (being down the bottom end of the historically-derived colour-scaling). In fact, I really can’t remember seeing anything “hotter” than light green in Victoria. This feeling was validated after crunching this summer’s stats and determining that Victorian demand made it only as high as a 8,638MW peak (and that this peak was actually at 15:55 NEM time on 22nd January 2015). Wow, that’s about 1,600MW lower than the peak demand achieved last year – and almost 1,900MW lower than the all-time record! For your reference, the trend over the four-month “Extended Summer” is shown in the following snapshot from NEM-Review : As noted on the image, there were only 2 days where demand peaked above 8,000MW (the 22nd January and the 7th January) and surprisingly few where demand even peaked above 7,000MW ! 2) How well was this expected? This summer, in conjunction with our traditional “main prize”, we also offered to give away a “consolation prize” for the closest to the market at guesstimating what the peak demand would be for the Victorian region (this was Competition #4 of a total of 7 competitions this summer ). 2a) Was it expected, by our competition entrants? Collating all the entries and plotting a distribution, we see this pattern: As we can see, the actual demand peak sat towards the bottom end of where the bulk of the entries landed – hence there were definitely some entrants who thought that Victorian demand might be as lacklustre as it turned out to be – and some considerably lower, as well. However, the majority of votes were for demand in between the actual level and up to the prior maximum experienced back in 2008-09 (a record which came close to being eclipsed last summer). SO WHO WINS THE “CONSOLATION” PRIZE FOR COMPETITION #4 (VIC PEAK) THIS SUMMER? One person who can now be enjoying their new portable BBQ prize, from Barbeques Galore, is revealed here… It’s always easier, in hindsight, to rationalise why such a big proportion of our entrants missed the boat on getting anywhere near what the peak demand ended up being. 2b) Was it expected, by AEMO? Back on 2nd January, when I posted these tips for entrants to competition #4 , I included a snapshot from NEM-Watch highlighting what the AEMO had said about what peak demand might be under the 3 different economic development scenarios, and the three different weather permutations. For ease of reference, here’s that image again: Just eye-balling this chart, it does appear that the actual demand peak of 8,638MW is in the vicinity of what the AEMO forecasted under a 50% POE (probability of exceedence) scenario. Hence, in summary, not really a surprise . Whilst on the topic of the above chart, note the big difference highlighted between the 50% and 10% POE predictions – we’ll come back to that below… 3) Looking in more detail? Firstly (as we did with our analysis of NEM-wide demand), we include a trend of the headline stats. From this we can see how the peak this past summer is the lowest it’s been in Victoria in (at least) the past 7 summers: We can also see the significant drop from the previous summer, which we suspect is primarily weather-related. Note, in this chart, the large gap between peak and average demand (and that there’s also a large gap between the 10% POE and 50% POE predictions by AEMO, shown above). These reflect the “peaky” nature of Victorian demand, in relation to some other regions – more on that in the coming days… Delving into more detail, we’ve extracted the relevant data and produced the following distribution chart, looking at the 5-minute dispatch intervals: When results are presented in this way, a number of specific changes are very evident. 3a) Closure of Point Henry smelter As previously noted on this site (by our guest author, Paul Taliangis) the closure of Point Henry aluminium smelter had a significant effect on Victorian demand. Note, in this post, that the consumption at Point Henry started declining in 2013-13, though the closure did not occur until August 2014. This can be clearly seen in the shift of minimum demands (highlighted in area 1 on the chart above) – beginning several years earlier, but with the major shift in 2014-15 (with the closure in August 2014 there’s no consumption measured for Point Henry in the chart above. 3b) The effect of solar not as pronounced in Victoria One of the other points that can be noted (in Area 2) is that the effect of solar is not quite as marked, given the lower impact of solar in Victoria (compared to the boom-region of Queensland, for instance – more on that when we come to Queensland). Using the limited range of small-scale solar production history we’ve saved into a pre-release beta of a future NEM-Review upgrade, we see that the APVI small-scale solar data for Victoria trends as follows: [please excuse the data glitch there for 2 days – it is a pre-release beta, after all] 3c) Peak demand there last year, not this year Also noteworthy is how (in Area 3) we see the peak demand that threatened to break the record in summer 2013-14 evaporate entirely in summer 2014-15. Using the same method as we did for NEM-wide demand earlier (zooming in on the peak demand level, and flipping the chart to cumulative) we see this very clearly: Keep in mind, as well, that the 1,000 dispatch interval amount of demand above 8,200MW* that’s been there in 4 of the past 7 years shown equates to 83 hours – or less than 4 days in total (again, a challenging proposition to cater for). Also keep in mind that in 2 years there were fewer intervals above 8,200MW – but that the peak demand did still stretch: 1) up to 9,624MW – 1,400MW above 8,200MW* for 16 lonely hours in 2010-11; and 2) up to 9,110MW – 900MW above 8,200MW* for about the same number of cumulative hours in 2011-12. * note that we chose 8,200MW arbitrarily as the place to start the x-axis, but the story is largely the same no matter what starting point we choose at the top end. Hence, in summary, Victorian peak demand : 1) occurs for only a couple of days each year, 2) at a level that’s more 4,000MW higher than average demand, 3) is higher some years and much lower other years (with a spread in the past 7 of almost 2,000MW), 4) that current technology (like demand response and solar PV ) are only partially successful in addressing ( refer here ), 5) hence is a very expensive challenge that’s not going away, and still needs to be catered for. Coincidentally I noted yesterday in the new Energy White Paper , hot off the press , (on p11) that it notes: “Peak use has been constant over time despite the overall reductions in demand, …” Well, looking at the last chart above, it’s clear that peak demand has been far from the same (year-on-year) – though it has certainly been a constant challenge , made even worse, perhaps, by the unpredictability of its extremes. As with all regions, we will watch with interest to see what happens in Victoria, moving forwards.",

    "title": "Benefits* of tracking systems in solar PV",
    "date": "08-04-2015 07:13:00 AM",
    "content": "On Thursday 2nd April, just prior to the Easter long weekend, I was fortunate to be able to attend an “Energy Express” seminar hosted by UQ Energy Initiative and the Global Change Institute – at which Professor Paul Meredith presented on the “Gatton Solar Research Facility”. Though not as large as the Nyngan solar power station, which opened recently , this one is also opened recently to add to a pre-existing portfolio of solar facilities at UQ that have been developed to assist in meeting a number of coincident objectives, including: 1) To assist UQ achieve some ambitious carbon reduction targets; 2) To assist in energy procurement for the university; and 3) To provide facilities for “learning via doing” enabling various disciplines to work together in a systemic way in areas relevant to where society is headed for the future. Professor Meredith covered a broad range of information during the talk, but one thing he noted stood out for me – and, I thought, would be of interest to some our readers as well. The following is my recollection of these particular points so, if there are any mistakes or omissions, please blame my memory and not Prof Meredith (for the benefit of our other readers, feel free to point these out below). At Gatton there are three different types of solar PV technology deployed (by First Solar, in this case): Section 1) The bulk of the facility is “standard” fixed solar panels; Section 2) There is a smaller share of the “off-the-shelf” single axis tracking system; and Section 3) UQ has, in conjunction with its partners, installed a “first of its kind” dual axis tracking system to ensure optimal alignment of each panel in this section With reference to the access provided here to the output data collected from the Gatton facility , I have copied in three static images that illustrate the particular point that caught my attention: 1) Production shape for the fixed-axis array Prof Meredith highlighted 19th March 2015, which appears to be only 13 days after the plant came online, as the day where he’d seen the text-book production shape for the solar array: Of the three banks of fixed-axis, I have selected the centre array. 2) Production shape for the single-axis tracking array Next, Prof Meredith highlighted the different production profile apparent when looking at the single-axis array: A “fatter” shape is clearly evident, which results from the ability of this array to change inclination to follow the sun’s path from east to west across the sky. 3) Production shape for the dual-axis tracking array. Extending the process further, Prof Meredith explained how UQ and its partners had implemented a “first-of-its-kind” dual axis array with a tracking system designed to maximise the output of the array at any given point in the day. The improvement in the shape here is not as marked (as from the 1st to the 2nd image above), but there does appear to be a higher capacity factor achieved. * Referring back to the title of this article “ Benefits of tracking systems in solar PV” you will note no reference (until now) of the costs involved in their installation. My memory is a little vague here, but I think it was mentioned that the cost of the dual axis tracking array was something like three times the cost (per Watt installed) of the standard fixed-axis array. As we’ve noted on WattClarity recently, demand in Queensland is peaking later and later in the day – including well after the 6pm sunset time implied in the charts above . Hence it does make it look difficult to achieve a commercially attractive payback on the fitting of tracking systems to increase the capacity factor beyond what’s possible with fixed axis arrays. It does, however, show evidence of the potential network benefits of west-facing (e.g. residential) solar arrays – though, I would suspect, this might have the countervailing impact of reducing the capacity factor possible with the traditional north-facing inclination. Perhaps those more knowledgeable in the solar space might like to help me understand better by adding comments below?",

    "title": "Peak NEM-wide demand this summer – the lowest in more than 10 years!",
    "date": "07-04-2015 06:40:00 AM",
    "content": "Back on 6th January, I posted this early analysis of prior peaks in NEM-Wide demand to assist those keen competition entrants who were trying to use a little science to place their entry into our “Best Demand Forecaster in the NEM” competition. This summer we used an extended definition of summer to include the whole of Q1 – meaning a 4-month long period of “Extended Summer” for the purposes of the competition. Seeing as we’ve just ticked over into April, we powered up NEM-Review to take a quick skim through what happened to NEM-wide demand over this 4-month period. For keen observers of what’s going on in the NEM, these results are truly staggering… 1) What was the actual peak this summer? Now, having run NEM-Watch in our office for situational awareness over the course of this summer period, I had already been aware that this was a low-demand summer (the colour-coding makes this easy, especially when coupled with these usage tips ). Indeed, I even had the suspicion that the demand had struggled to break even the 30,000MW mark. However it was not until crunching the numbers that I realised how startling this summer was… this summer the demand could just scrape up to 29,134MW as a peak . There was only the one day where the demand peered above 29,000MW. A few initial impressions of this amazingly low peak: (a) The peak this occurred at 15:55 on Thursday 22nd January , a day so unremarkable that (it seems) we did not see anything worthy of a post on that day. We did, however, post these comments the day before , noting higher demand forecast for Victoria. (b) The low peak is more than 4,000MW lower than the peak achieved just 12 months previously – and more than 6,300MW lower than what might stand as an all-time record for a long, long time – perhaps for all-time? (back from summer 2008-09); (c) This peak is more than 1,000MW below what was the previous lowest peak on record over the past 10 years – what we thought was a very low level of 30,218MW back in summer 2011-12 (prior to that time Tasmania was not part of the NEM, so NEM-wide comparisons are not apples to apples). 2) What did our entrants think it would be? As a company, we’re now in our 16th year of operations – and our long-running competition has become a much anticipated chance to test the skills of a cross-section of industry participants, spectators and commentators (though we do deliberately limit the pool of entrants by accepting entries only in the quiet weeks of Christmas and New Year). Because of the calibre of the people who enter, we take a keen interest in analysing the distribution of entries for this competition. For the past couple years we have limited entries to one-per-person for this grand prize, so the results presented below (we believe) are a reasonable proxy for where knowledgeable people in the industry do expect demand to peak over a given summer period. Wow, were most people this summer disappointed! SO WHO WINS THE GRAND PRIZE THIS SUMMER? One person who won’t be upset that most of the other entrants were well off the money is the person who’ll be enjoying the new BBQ prize this year. Click through here for more information . It’s always easier, in hindsight, to rationalise why such a big proportion of our entrants missed the boat on getting anywhere near what the peak demand ended up being. In our tips published on 6th January , for instance (just before the competition closed), we did show (last chart on the page) that the incidence of demand above 30,000MW had been declining over recent summers. The first point to keep in mind, however, is that there’s a massive 4,000MW reduction between the peak demand this year and what we saw just 12 months ago. Seen in this light, some might conclude that most of the difference seen over that period come back to weather-related differences. 3) Let’s look into further details… For the following analysis, we’ve added November into the scope of the analysis in order to provide a view of what’s happened over the 5-month period when hot weather has been experienced. Given the extreme demand experienced in summer 2008-09, we’ve started there and looked at 7 successive periods. Firstly, we include a trend of the basic stats: Delving into more detail, we’ve extracted the relevant data and produced the following distribution chart, looking at the 5-minute dispatch intervals: When results are presented in this way, a number of specific changes are very evident. 3a) Overnight demand is dropping (AREA 1) Demand instances down this bottom end of the curve are the ones that occur in the depths of the night. We see that demand is dropping off at this level – also shown above in a decline in minimum demand of over 1,000MW over this 7-year period . Keeping in mind that these are for the hot months, and that the sun is obviously not shining, it’s reasonable to conclude that this this is not due to heating, and that it’s also not to do with solar operating behind the meter. Instead,the closures of large industrial facilities (Kurri Kurri and Point Henry aluminium smelters being two obvious ones) have played a role in this – as will have greater use of energy efficiency in its multitude of forms: 1. at work (e.g. the now-cancelled EEO scheme); 2. out in the community (e.g. street lighting retrofit to LED) and 3. at home (e.g. perhaps more efficient appliances, with lower power draw on standby?) 3b) Instances of demand above 25,000MW are dropping (AREA 2) There’s certainly a pronounced reduction in demand instances above approximately 25,000MW (which would typically be in the peak time periods). In the first chart, this is also seen in the (>2,000MW) reduction in average demand observed. Again, these reductions will be due to a number of factors including the following: 1. This is where we see solar PV playing an increasing role – and that’s the reason why we have been so keen to add in a view of solar into NEM-Watch v10 (for both small-scale and large-scale). It’s early days for us with solar data, but our recent analysis showed a peak solar output of approximately 1,700MW across a 7-week period. 2. Layered on top of this, we hypothesise that wider use of insulation has reduced air-conditioning load during these “hot month” afternoons and evenings. 3. More broadly, we wonder about the extent to which this change is due to commercial responses to higher electricity prices , at work and at home? 4. There are undoubtedly other factors, as well. 3c) Extreme peaks come and go (AREA 3) Distinct from AREA 2 is the extreme right of the chart (marked as AREA 3). Here we see that the instances of demand above 30,000MW has dropped significantly from the high point in 2009-10 (the year after a record maximum was set) to the point where not a single dispatch interval was seen in summer 2014-15 above 30,000MW. This are of the curve is where peaking generation capacity is required, along with a significant amount of network capacity that is required for only those few days each year (or not at all this summer!) when the demand peaks. 3d) Is the peak demand problem getting worse? It might seem counterintuitive, for some, to post such a question at the end of a summer when demand barely raised a whimper. However I would leave you with the following chart that revisits the distribution above, but is cumulative, and looks just at the pointy end of the demand curve. Keep in mind that 500 Dispatch Intervals equates to just over 40 hours – so less than 2 days of cumulative incidence. In the first distribution curve (repeated below for just the past 2 years) we see how the 2 distributions are very close to identical, in practical terms – except at this peak end . Herein lies a big problem – and, it seems, all the initiatives noted above (solar PV, efficiency, closure of industrial facilities, usage reductions in response to higher average costs, etc…) don’t really help with this one. See how the curves overlay each other. Summer 2013-14 and summer 2014-15 were virtually indistinguishable – with the exception of levels of peak experienced, which saw demand in the prior year peak more than 4,000MW higher than the summer that followed. This is a very expensive challenge – to have generation and network infrastructure sitting around waiting for those few peak days that might occur one year, but not at all the next! We’ve posted before about examples of demand response in the National Electricity Market. There are already existing mechanisms for demand response in the energy market that can assist with respect to spot prices (and, in any case, surplus capacity in the generation sector represents a privatised loss as opposed to a socialised cost). In the network sector, on the other hand, there does not currently exist any systematic, NEM-wide method whereby demand response can play a role to assist in moderating the cost impact of capacity built to meet these extreme peaks. More on that one later… Over the month of April, as time permits, we’ll also publish analysis about the other 6 competitions we ran in parallel this summer – so stay tuned to find out what happened to demand in each region, and to wind production across the NEM (and, as a result, to who the other winners are)….",

    "content": "Two of the topical news stories to arise in the month of March (in a period where energy is quite topical indeed – with issues including the “never-ending story” of the RET Review debate , privatisation in NSW, coal seam gas inquiries galore and a seemingly endless search to identify “wind farm syndrome”) have been: 1) the first production* from large-scale solar PV at Nyngan; and * “first production from large-scale solar” – at least from large-scale solar PV for which data is published by AEMO – hence with apologies to Royalla! If there was data available, we’d love to include… 2) the coincident launch of our NEM-Watch widget , in conjunction with RenewEconomy , as another way we serve the broader energy sector by striving to make the complexity of the energy market more understandable to a broad cross-section of interested stakeholders. On the second point, we have appreciated receiving the range of feedback that’s come in from enjoyers of the service (with comments from David Woodgrove , Mike Reeves and many others helping to inform our plans for the ongoing development of the expanding range of services we provide). Please keep your feedback coming… We previously posted early news about first generation at Nyngan seen a week-and-a-half ago, and there’s been plenty of coverage elsewhere on the web (and some in hard-copy) since that time. This is understandable, given how solar PV is growing rapidly (off a zero base only a couple years ago), and looks set to continue ramping considerably – though the actual growth path will depend on a number of things, including what happens to government support programs, and to efforts to reign in actual network costs (and concerns about the perceived threat of their ongoing escalation – flames which were fanned again in the NSW and QLD election campaigns). We thought it would be useful to post this visual reminder of how small-scale, distributed solar is currently leaving large-scale, centralised solar in the shade : This snapshot was taken this morning from the full version of NEM-Watch 10 (also released recently). So we see that small-scale solar is producing roughly 100 times more than the large-scale solar shown (so 50 times, if we factor in Royalla). At today’s peak aggregate output of about 1,050MW compared to a scheduled demand of approx 22,500MW, this represents an instantaneous market share of 4.7% (or actually a bit less considering the small-scale solar nets off total demand, which AEMO calls “Native Demand”. There’s been plenty written about solar recently including why the currently small market share is big news , and why small-scale solar might be fading, but larger systems are where new business can be made currently (here’s one view of why small-scale solar is fading ) . As always, we will watch with interest to see what unfolds…",

    "title": "Approaching 62 hours becalmed on the mainland – what would this mean for battery storage?",
    "date": "30-03-2015 02:56:00 PM",
    "content": "This morning I noted ( and tweeted ) that there was virtually no wind production collectively coming from all wind farms across the mainland. This situation has continued through till this afternoon, which means that for the past 15 hours total wind production NEM-wide has been below 400MW, and as low as 200MW (with most of what is being produced in this spell coming from Tasmania). What’s more, the total wind production has been below approx 550MW since midnight heading into Saturday morning. This can be seen in the following snapshot from NEM-Watch v10 , highlighting how the current lull (approaching 62 hours) is longer than patterns seen over the prior 21 days: Note that I have not had time to do any definitive review of the longest period at which wind output has been low (such a review would turn up different durations for different definitions of “low”). For the purpose of these back-of-the-envelope calculations, this is a useful starting point. I’ve posted previously about the highs and the lows of wind production (including recently in terms of interaction with solar , given the inclusion of solar PV (small and large) in the new NEM-Watch v10 ) but today I have wondered what this means in energy terms – and the implications for storage . Let’s assume, for the moment, that it’s only wind that supplies the NEM – a very extreme case that not a single person is advocating (on the left, or the right) , but which I have found useful as an exercise to get my head around the size of the storage challenge. Since 1st November 2014, the daily average NEM-wide Scheduled Demand has oscillated from a low of about 17,700MW (on Christmas day) to a high of 24,100MW (on 22nd January – the day after I posted this ) – as shown in this trend from NEM-Review : Let’s pick 21,000MW as a rough median level, and knock off 500MW in a contrived scenario saying that the current doldrums would occur at a time when demand averaged this level – this means, in energy terms: 20,500MW x 62 hours = 1,271,000MWh of energy required from storage Note that this assumes all sorts of things, like no alternate sources of anything except for existing wind capacity (whereas we can see in the NEM-Watch snapshot above the effect of hydro, for instance, as another zero-emission source – and one with more flexibility). However it does also assume that the current level of solar injections would persist at the same time, as they are captured (as negative demand) in the scheduled demand numbers in the NEM-Review chart. The information in this article seems to imply (if my maths is correct) that a vehicle could contribute around 20kWh of storage – and this seems to be in the range of what I have read elsewhere. Leaving aside trickier technical questions (like how quickly injections can ramp up, and how controllable, how they’d be charged in the first place, how many cars could be left in-situ for 2.5 days without use to enable them to feed to the grid, etc…) this means that, if we were to deliver that amount of stored energy from electric vehicle batteries alone, we would need: 1,271,000,000kWh / 20kWh = 63,550,000 electric vehicle batteries required. How many cars are there in Australia, I wonder? The ABS here notes something like 17,000,000 vehicles in total, or only 26% of the total vehicle number required in this contrived scenario (notwithstanding a smaller number of passenger vehicles, and some not being in the NEM, etc…). Obviously this does not add up. Now, this scenario is contrived in a number of ways – so I wonder what might make it more “real”? Continuing from this back-of-the-envelope calculation , we hypothesise that the NEM might be able to absorb about 10 times the current installed capacity of wind – and that this might mean that, at peak wind production, wind farms might supply all the NEM’s consumption at some points in time. Assuming a 10-times multiplier, this might also mean the 500MW minimum output above scales to 5000MW, which might mean 16,000MW “unserved” over the 62 hour period. 16,000MW x 62 hours = 992,000MWh of energy required from storage 992,000MWh / 20kWh = 49,000,000 electric vehicle batteries (still nowhere near plausible). I’ll return to this thought process as time permits… Please refer again to our FULL DISCLOSURE 1 about how we strive to remain technology agnostic. Our role is just to make the complexity in the energy market more understandable – whatever its rules of operation just happen to be. We hope that, by doing this, negative unintended consequences of policy choices that governments choose to make on behalf of their constituents can be reduced.",

    "title": "Some interesting patterns emerge, with the interaction of wind and solar",
    "date": "23-03-2015 09:37:00 AM",
    "content": "As some of our readers are aware, this year we’ve been upgrading our widely-used NEM-Watch application , with one of the key enhancements being the inclusion of the APVI’s estimates for live small-scale solar production in each region (a data set produced as an outcome of ARENA funding). An early release of NEM-Watch v10 was made available last week. We’ve provided further information about the data sets combined in the NEM-Watch v10 dashboard . This “APVI Small Solar” data set was also added to enhance the NEM-Watch widget on RenewEconomy , which is a service we have developed in conjunction with our fellow energy-industry-observers at RenewEconomy. We have done this in order to provide transparency and so improve the level of discussion about policy decisions relating to a transition to lower-emissions energy , as noted in this testimonial by a user of the service. An image of the smaller widget (from Sunday 22nd – coincidentally at the start of production for the larger-scale Nyngan solar farm) is shown on the right -> We’ve taken this step because of the ongoing boom in solar PV that’s occurring across the NEM – mainly (at at this stage) small scale, and residential. As an interesting aside, we have also observed the emergence (in parallel) of the the solar industry as a powerful lobby group that seems to have had a telling impact in the never-ending RET Review process. This makes obvious sense, given the rapid growth of jobs in the sector – and also, perhaps, because it is not (yet?) dominated by large corporates (though we have noted that the bigger retailers have shown increased interest of late – in what I presume to be, at least in part, a customer retention strategy). Obviously there are different views in the energy sector & the broader community of what is seen (by some) as a success story by some, and (by others) another form of socialised cost /privatised profit in a market that’s becoming very crowded with them. As noted before, we try to remain technology-agnostic and just present data & information with clarity – to help people make better decisions . What’s particularly of interest to me, personally, is to understand the interplay between the two main intermittent generation sources currently available in the NEM – wind and solar. These back-of-the-envelope calculations performed a couple years ago highlighted some challenges that would have to be overcome for the NEM to progress to a large share of generation from wind. Using the current release of our NEM-Review v6 historical analysis package , we can sum up the path the NEM has taken over the past 16 years in this trended production-by-fuel type chart: It’s clear, from this chart, that there are a number of other stories that can be extracted from the chart. These will have to be food for other posts , or some of our readers might want to comment in their own sites and link with comments below? My focus in this post, is the growth of wind production over less than 10 years to be producing, on average, 4% of the large-scale energy generated in the NEM (based on data reported by AEMO and accessible through NEM-Review ). (a) To some this will be a “glass half full” story, whilst to others it will be “glass half-empty”. (b) With reference to these back-of-the-envelope calculations , the NEM might be able to reach 37% (requiring a massive capacity build even to get there). To go further than that would require: i. more diverse siting (the big projects proposed for North Queensland would probably fit this bill, but: – I have been (to date) unable to access data that would help to confirm whether this would be the case, or not. – whatever the case is, in terms of diversity, their connection would require transmission work (hence increasing the cost of energy delivered). ii. another possibility ( suggested by Joel in comments here ) would be scaling in the same locations as current wind farms, but “spilling” at times of peak production (which would reduce the capacity factor of affected farms – increasing the unit cost of energy delivered). iii. the holy grail, it seems, is cost-effective, widespread, distributed storage (which would increase the cost of energy delivered). Hence we have been interested to consider the interplay between wind and solar , as these are the only two* renewable technologies delivered by the cornucopia of subsidies that have been layered onto the electricity supply industry over nearly 10 years. * It seems reasonable to assume that, unless something significant changes (in terms of relative costs of other technology, or incentives for them) that wind and solar will continue to deliver the lion’s share of new renewable generation in the NEM Until now, it has not really been possible for us to investigate the interaction between the two …. It’s very early days for us, in terms of the availability of the ARENA-sponsored APVI solar data , but I have been interested to have a look at historical trends of solar and wind over the past month or so (the limit of our data collection, at this stage) in a very early beta of a NEM-Review upgrade that might be released later this year (pending a few things). Email us if you’d like us to notify you if/when this upgrade becomes available? So what have we seen in the limited range of solar production data history (29th January 2015 to 17th March 2015) we have collected, to date? Note that this is only a 7-week history , so be careful what conclusions you draw in the following. This analysis is not provided to be conclusive, but rather to stimulate further thinking. 1) The highs and the lows Stacking hydro, wind and solar (the three zero-emission generation sources currently contributing anything significant) together over that period produces the following trend: In this trend I have annotated the peaks and the troughs: (a) A peak of 5,465MW in the 15:30 trading period on Wednesday 11th February, and another peak at 5,422MW in the 16:00 trading period on Thursday 4th March (a day prior to this peak in QLD’s electricity demand ); (b) The lowest point being approximately 680MW at 03:30 on Sunday 8th March, with other low points also seeming to be in the depths of the night (unsurprising, with the sun resting at the time). Removing hydro from the chart above to focus on the two more intermittent (and less controllable) energy inputs, we see the following trend: The low point is at the same time as when all three were considered together (but, considering wind + solar only, we see the contribution was virtually NIL at that time). The high point was at a different point in time (at a level of 3,410MW). What’s perhaps more surprising (at least to me, given I have only had access to solar output data for a short period) is to see a NEM-wide peak solar production as high as 1,710MW on 3rd March . Keep in mind that this maximum is from a small sample of only a few weeks over this extended summer period, so it’s certainly possible that there would have been higher-output days earlier. It’s also of interest to me that this peak in solar output occurs when wind output was relatively low. I also noted that peak wind (in the time-range studied) was 2,740MW – and that this occurred in the depths of the night when solar output was NIL, and NEM-Wide demand was at the bottom of its daily cadence. Compare this level to this earlier note about peak wind over summer 2014-15, with respect to our competition give-away (competition #7). 2) Distribution of half-hourly wind and solar In the two charts above, we can see periods when solar was high when wind was low (and vice-versa) – but we also can see periods when both were high (or both were low). I wondered – again noting that this is a small historical data range to sample – what the degree of correlation is. Hence I used this internal beta version of NEM-Review to produce the following correlation: The first thought that jumps out in this plot of all half-hours over this 7-week history is that there are obviously (night-time) periods when the solar plant will be producing NIL – so we updated the same query to include only half-hours in the time-range 07:00 to 17:00 NEM time: In this chart we see what appears, to the eye, to be close to a “perfectly” random distribution . If this is the case, what it will mean is that the NEM will need to cater for both: (a) Periods when both wind and solar are producing near maximums; and (b) Periods when both wind and solar are producing near minimums. Thinking this brings to mind previous comments about doomsday predictions about security of supply , and prior comments about the challenges of implementing an efficient and effective capacity market for the NEM. This is something I will continue thinking about, as time permits. For instance, a logical (and interesting) third variable to add into the mix would be demand – though this will have to wait for another post… For the present time, I wanted to just comment on the three areas highlighted in the chart above: Note 1 = there are still some data points in the filtered (daylight hours) time range shown recording zero solar production. Our collaboration with APVI to add their small-scale solar data feed into NEM-Watch (and possibly into NEM-Review in future) is early days at present, so we are still ironing out the data feed. I suspect these points stem from disruptions to the data, as it’s not logical that the aggregate output (NEM-wide) would be zero during the day. Note 2 = I also noted that, removing the night-time data points removed the times of peak wind output, which happened to be at night. This is not the first time I (or others) have noted this, and is one of the reasons why prices plunge below zero in the South Australian region overnight on (windy) occasions. Note 3 = also of interest is the area to the top-right of the chart, which shows no peaks of wind output at the times when solar output is maximised. This does seem to make sense at first glance, given that we had also seen (on other occasions) that the wind tends to die away at times of extreme temperature, which I am presuming would have correlated with peak solar output. 3) Implied capacity factor of installed small-scale solar The solar data above is published by the APVI following ARENA-funding of the creation of the solar map (more details of the ARENA project here ). The current method used to derive the estimated production is to scale up a sample set of data by installed small-scale solar capacity in each region of the NEM. I am not aware of the precise magnitude of the installed capacity used in the time-range above (this will increase over time – and my understanding is that this is still increasing rapidly). However, if we assume that the installed capacity is only 1,710MW (i.e. the peak production noted above) and calculate an implied capacity factor from the volume of solar produced over these several weeks, the number produced should be an over-estimate of the actual capacity factor – i.e. the installed capacity will be more than this 1,710MW, so the denominator will be larger, so the percentage smaller. Hence we complete the following calculation: Average production (all hours) / Assumed installed capacity = Implied Capacity factor 435MW / 1,710 MW = 25% implied (over-estimated) capacity factor This result seems plausible. Using a 20% capacity factor (the number I have heard quoted most commonly) and working backwards this would imply an installed capacity of 2,170MW (perhaps one of our readers can chip in below with some real numbers?) . Assuming this is roughly correct, then 1,710 / 2,170 would mean peak production of only 79% of rated capacity. Obviously it’s not reasonable to assume that solar production spread across the NEM will all produce at maximum simultaneously. One of our readers might like to comment about whether peak production at “only” 80% of installed capacity across such a broad geographic area (and keeping in mind the nature of the assumptions in the APVI estimation method) is reasonable or not? Given the newness of this new data source, at the importance of solar to some of the more challenging issues the NEM faces moving forwards, I will return to this on WattClarity as time permits.",

    "date": "20-03-2015 10:46:00 AM",
    "content": "It’s Friday morning 20th March and I don’t have much time today. Two of the jobs today being: 1) making an early release of the new NEM-Watch v10 available here , and 2) updating the NEM-Watch widget we’ve developed for RenewEconomy . However I would like to include two snapshots of another high demand day in Queensland yesterday (Thursday 19th March) that again reinforces, to me, that it’s really becoming two distinctly different zones in the NEM – a higher demand Queensland region and the “southern regions” zone where (at least to my memory) demand has barely whimpered through the whole of summer. In the next couple of weeks – because of the impending close of our competition(s) for this summer – I’ll invest some time in crunching the numbers, but I can’t recall seeing any high demand days in any of the other regions. These snapshots (from the new NEM-Watch v10.0.4 application) are particularly timely given Gerard’s comments yesterday about how the ongoing solar boom is hollowing out demand in the middle of the day ( the “Duck Curve” ), but leaving later evening peaks – at least in some locations – largely untouched. As noted before , it seems that (at a regional level) the timing of the peak in scheduled demand is shifting later in the day than what It was before I left the office that I tweeted this this image noting that demand was high and likely to go higher, in marked contrast with what we saw in Victoria at the same time: It wasn’t till later that evening at home that I grabbed this image highlighting how the demand had peaked up at 8,408MW – and late in the day as well (18:50 NEM time): Yesterday’s late peak in Queensland demand provided one more reminder of a number of different challenges that the NEM is facing with the interplay between emissions-reduction policy and the traditional focuses of security of supply and cost of supply .",

    "title": "Electricity Pricing: An alternative to unlimited bill increases",
    "date": "19-03-2015 09:12:00 AM",
    "content": "Australia is unusual in the fact that more than 50% of electricity bills are related to network costs . The big issue is that networks must be built to handle the highest load of the year . The development of solar panels means that the generation in the middle of the day is reducing the average load, while the peak demand is largely unchanged. We need to develop a process to encourage load peaks to reduce. In the figure below for a feeder in Caloundra the midday load is reducing as solar power levels increase but the evening peak is almost unchanged. Automated use of batteries and demand shifting is the main hope for addressing the peak demand issue. The problem at the moment is that the electricity tariffs provide no incentive to residential premises to reduce the peak. However, create a market and the solutions will be found . There have been proposals for a high charge for the 4 hours around the evening peak and a medium charge for another 4 hours adjacent to that. The problem with this crude form of incentive is that it is not reflective of any real network constraint . If the real peak lasts 1 hour then increased charging for a longer time makes some solutions less viable. Similarly, if the time of peak shifts to 10pm the tariff is creating a new problem rather than actually reducing the peak. The appropriate charge is to reflect the long run real cost of supplying the loads. The wrong way If the price charged for electricity jumps by a factor of 10 at 6:15pm on some nights, all it does is to annoy customers with no real possibility of maintaining changes in the use of lights and TV for the long term. The right way What a real cost-reflective tariff should incentivise is automatic control of items such as pool pumps, hot water systems, clothes dryers and batteries to limit the draw at peak times . The response can be within parameters set by the customer possibly responding to signals sent about network congestion . Location matters For some areas there is not a congestion problem and the charges should reflect the ownership cost of the poles and wires. In other areas the peak load growth can be driving substantial network costs and it is these areas where a cost reflective pricing would drive investment in batteries and peak load reduction through automated responses. Why change? The current scheme is potentially on a path to a “Death Spiral” where increasing network costs encourage some customers to buy batteries and go “off-grid”. This raises the network costs for remaining customers, which incentivises a new wave of customers to go “off-grid”. Introducing true cost reflective pricing will provide a reward for customers with batteries to stay on-grid. Winners and Losers The costs for rural customers could rise substantially but other parts of the social security/tax system are a better mechanism to encourage right decisions than highly subsidized electricity bills. How it might work One option for the future is given in the figure below, which shows aggregators responding to the real costs and making a market arrangement with customers to make load variations in line with network needs.

    "title": "The NEM reaches Peak Gas",
    "date": "16-03-2015 02:35:00 PM",
    "content": "Analysis by Paul Taliangis and Zhi Oh at Core Energy Group shows that the gas powered generation sector (GPG) in the NEM has reached its peak and is poised to enter a steep fall in consumption from over 200 PJ in 2014 to 100PJ or below by 2018. In September 2013, Core Energy published an article “The Changing Role of Gas in the NEM” which presented a view that gas is likely to transition from a combined base, intermediate and peak role, to an increasingly upper-intermediate and peak only role in the NEM. This article provides an update on the changing dynamics of the GPG segment of the NEM. Recent GPG Consumption Near Peak In 2014, (utilising data from NEM-Review) GPG gas consumption was approximately 215 PJ, an increase of almost 30 PJ from the previous year . The growth in GPG gas demand observable in Queensland is largely attributable to unusually low gas prices associated with short term LNG production (so called “ramp gas”). This has resulted from in gas prices of approximately AUD1.00/GJ in the Wallumbilla STTM. Recent year consumption by the major NEM GPG generators is summarised in the following table. Table 1.1 Major Generator Historical Gas Use, Generation & Projections Generator State Historical Gas Use in 2014 Historical Generation in 2014 Projection Gas Usage in 2018 Projection Generation in 2018 Tallawarra NSW 17 PJ p.a. 2.4 TWh p.a. Braemar 1 QLD 25PJ p.a. 2.1 TWh p.a. Braemar 2 QLD 25 PJ p.a. 2.1 TWh p.a. Darling Downs QLD 27 PJ p.a. 3.5 TWh p.a. Swanbank E QLD 17 PJ p.a. 2.3 TWh p.a. Osborne SA 12 PJ p.a. 1.4 TWh p.a. Pelican Point SA 12 PJ p.a. 1.5 TWh p.a. Torrens B SA 16 PJ p.a. 1.3 TWh p.a. Mortlake VIC 20 PJ p.a. 1.6 TWh p.a. TOTAL ALL 171 PJ p.a. 18.2 TWh p.a. 85 PJ p.a. 9 TWh p.a. Sources: NEM-Review & Core Energy Group Editor’s Note – corrected transcription error (TWh not GWh) following Tim’s comment Core believes that GPG gas consumption has passed its peak and will enter a steep downward consumption curve as coal fired power and renewable energy edge it out of the base and lower to mid-intermediate load market. The key factors bringing about this change is the repeal of the Clean Energy Act and associated removal of carbon tax, and the massive increase in absolute gas prices from an existing weighted average of approximately $4/GJ to a marginal cost $8/GJ (ex gas processing plant) by 2018. Competition from Alternative Fuel Sources At marginal cost of AUD8.00/GJ, the cost of gas-fired generation is estimated at approximately AUD60/MWh, with some variation depending on the generator efficiency. Coal-fired generation, without the carbon tax, is in the range of AUD10/MWh for brown coal and AUD20/MWh for black coal. Coal has an evident cost advantage over gas, rendering gas uncompetitive for base load generation. Gas also faces competition from renewable energy, with increasing renewable capacity, mainly wind power that services the base load demand. The penetration of solar PV systems with energy storage pose as a potential competitor to GPG in the peak electricity segment in the medium to long term. The ability to store electricity would enable households to change consumption patterns by charging batteries during off-peak and using stored electricity throughout peak period. This would see falling demand for grid-electricity during peak times. Change is Underway The signs of change are already evident in the NEM and in Core’s view this will accelerate during 2015-2017. Announced changes include: › Stanwell’s mothballing of the 385 MW Swanbank E CCGT late 2014. Stanwell plans to redirect gas and has started up coal-fired Tarong Power Station to replace Swanbank E generation capacity. › AGL’s announced plans to mothball the 480 MW Torrens Island A in 2017. The key changes will be focused on generators which have provided significant base or intermediate load to date – as observable in the Table above. GPG Consumption to Nosedive Core’s view of GPG’s declining trend is broadly consistent with the recently published AEMO 2014 NGFR – a marked downward revision from AEMO’s historical scenarios. Table 1.2 GPG Annual Gas Consumption Forecast – Eastern Australia | PJ Source: AEMO 2014 NGFR Concluding Comments In a high gas price environment, compounded with challenging competitive forces in the electricity sector, GPG is expected to halve by 2018. As previously stated, gas will continue to play a key role in upper intermediate and peak generation in the short term, due to operational flexibility advantages and lower price sensitivity in this segment of the load curve. Its role in the upper intermediate and peak generation could also face growing competition due to technological advances in the medium to long-term future.

    "date": "06-03-2015 04:11:00 PM",
    "content": "Amidst the excitement yesterday of the new peak (sort of) reached in Queensland’s electricity demand , I did notice this article in the Fin Review quoting Bruce Mountain – speaking about the need for capacity payments in the NEM. I don’t have much time today, but wanted to list several aspects of this multi-faceted issue that I have been puzzling about, as time has permitted. 1) Why has this argument emerged? It should be noted, at the start, that any calls for capacity markets now (with the NEM having survived 16 years without one) revolve around each individual’s forecasts for the future – and it follows that the only thing that’s certain is that every forecast for the future will be wrong , each in different ways (especially in such a time of technological and social change). I’ve previously written about doomsday predictions for security of supply here . It is because of concerns about such a “doomsday” arriving (i.e. where the sun does not shine, the wind does not blow, but demand is still there – whilst thermal generators, starved of revenue opportunity, have been effectively run into the ground – so the lights go out) that we now see discussions about capacity markets. I have a vague recollection that prior energy market reviews (like Parer and ERIG) concluded no need for capacity markets at the time. In my doomsday article , I noted the irony about how some in the NEM are calling for the introduction of capacity markets (to avert looming supply/demand challenges) whilst in the WEM there are calls for its abandonment (due to concerns for value-for-money). These two counterposed arguments, to me, sum up the for-and-against case for capacity markets in general terms – i.e. you would not ordinarily need them (as the energy-only market works) but we’ve messed with the market to such an extent (a “messing” which is scheduled to continue into the future) that they now look, to some, as a reasonable (though expensive) proposition. Calls for, and potential designs for, a capacity mechanism need to take place with reference to an individual’s forecasts for the future. 1a) There’s the “what might be” cases… In one corner, there’s a plethora of different scenarios that might unfold – with these scenarios dependent on new technologies (and service models) emerging. For instance, we’re hearing a lot about the possible “rise of storage” – and its likely that we’ll hear much more in future. Much of the commentary I have seen has involved various projections about how the cost is coming down rapidly, to the point where storage can be ubiquitous. However the current status is that storage is not being widely used to balance supply and demand at present. Perhaps ironically, the introduction of a Capacity Market (for some, the lever to ensure continued operation of sufficient thermal capacity) might actually turn out to be one of the levers that helps with mass roll-out of storage capacity across the market. Nor is wave generation, or tidal power, or solar thermal, or nuclear (in Australia), etc…. 1b) … and there’s the “based on current trends” case The only prudent course of action seems to be that a capacity market, were it to be implemented, should be designed such that (as a “base case”) it could work with a continuation of the three most dominant existing trends working in parallel: i. Large-scale wind (incentivised by the LRET) locating in locations of highest wind intensity (but not necessarily with much thought to what effect this will have on the wholesale market, and hence prices there). In other words, in the south-east of the NEM as discussed here . ii. Distributed small-scale solar PV (incentivised by the SRES and avoided network charges) continuing to maximise production when the sun shines, hollowing out what used to be the traditional period of peak demand. iii. Existing thermal plant , increasingly asked to run cycling operations and ramp quickly over time, needing to recover more than a more volatile spot price might otherwise provide in a smaller number of hours run, on average, each day. Coincidentally, today I noticed this very interesting analysis by Opower of this type of issue, referenced to Germany with an upcoming solar eclipse. Having designed a market such that it might work in a scenario that we know is plausible (as it’s just a continuation of existing patterns) the more hypothetical alternate scenarios become sensitivities that the market should also provide for, where possible. 2) How can Capacity Markets be efficient, and effective? My sense is that there are a number of challenges that would need to be resolved to make capacity markets efficient, and effective. Some of these follow (note that they are inter-related, so apologies for some circular commentary): 2a) Who has responsibility for buying the capacity? Let’s start with the consumer of this “capacity”. Who should have responsibility for its procurement – and (as a related issue) what happens if they get it wrong? Option 1 = It seems clear to me that, in a perfect world , the consumer (or consuming entity) should have responsibility for ensuring they have enough capacity for that they require should be the person (or entity) that actually uses that capacity. After all, they are the ones who are most likely to know what they actually want. In this ideal world, the market would work such that a person’s consumption could rise to that procured capacity level and then no more. For instance, fuses could be set to the level of capacity procured. However the world is far from perfect, and it does not take long to understand why such an approach has many barriers: i. Firstly there’s the various technological and societal/cultural barriers to such an approach working, enmasse (picture the technologically-challenged Grandma at home trying to understand that concept). ii. Perhaps a bigger issue is, though, who’s responsibility would be to procure capacity, in advance, for the people (and organisations) that don’t yet exist as customers in the NEM, or even a particular region of the NEM? Option 2 = So we could crawl up the value supply chain to the retailer and mandate that these guys have responsibility for procuring capacity that meets the needs of the energy users they serve. These organisations are, at least, relatively close to their customers – and are supposed to understand the customer’s needs for other commercial purposes. However here, also, we encounter significant barriers to effective implementation: i. Keeping in mind that we’re talking about procurement some period in advance, in a market where (in Victoria for instance) the churn rate is something like 30% annually, what hope does a retailer have of predicting how much capacity will be required to service its demand at some future point in time. ii. Layered on top of that bigger issue is the emerging challenge of embedded technology “behind the meter” that has the potential to eat the retailers lunch – as discussed here . First solar, then storage, then “the next big thing” Option 3 = Perhaps we conclude that Option 2 is not a real option, either. So we crawl up the chain further and give that hospital pass to the poor market operator (the AEMO). We ask them to correctly forecast how much capacity is going to be required at some point in future (which is, some might say, what they already do) but then we layer into that significant financial cost on getting the answer right (or, more accurately, degrees of wrong-ness). Sounds to me like it’s similar, in some ways, to all the argy-bargy going on about “gold plating” in the transmission and distribution networks in recent years. There are certainly other factors at play in the network debate, but with reference to thoughts about capacity market for energy, there are some similarities: 1) Collectively we (through the rules in place at the time) asked the NSPs to forecast how much capacity would be required to serve us, and build to meet the need. 2) We then – directly and through government reviews such as the “2004 Electricity Distribution and Service Delivery (EDSD) Review” in Queensland – made it clear that the “lights going out” scenario was not a scenario we were prepared to talk rationally about, in terms of cost-benefit trade-off. 3) We, as energy users, are allowed to be very vague in terms of our plans to plug in more appliances (or build more energy-intensive industries) and yet assume capacity will be there to meet our needs at that future point in time; and 4) At some future point in time, we’re surprised when the cost for serving us in this way is so high. Go figure! Someone wise is reported to have once said something along the lines of “doing the same thing – again-and-again – and expecting a different result, is not very smart”. So why is it that it seems to me that calls for a capacity market have some elements of this same issue? 2b) How much capacity is required? In the process of determining who has responsibility for procuring the capacity, we also need to determine how much capacity is required. There’s a couple aspects to this – as follows: i. We need to start with Actual Demand . Whilst this is known in real time, it’s not known with certainty any time ahead of now (and the level of this uncertainty is greater further out into the future). To illustrate this, I have included an excerpt of AEMO’s 2014 NEFR highlighting one table containing some forecasts for Queensland’s maximum demand through summer 2014-15 which, you will recall, we watched quite closely yesterday here : The above image provides a comparison that’s not apples-to-apples, strictly speaking, but it does illustrate the type of issue that’s being discussed here. Now forecasting is, naturally, a thankless task – how much more fraught with dispute would it be if there was a large amount of revenue (or loss of load) riding on the result, in terms of firm procurement of capacity reserves? ii. An allowance on top of demand . The difficulty does not just stop there, however. Even if we can forecast demand perfectly (which we can’t) we also need to add an allowance on top in the procurement of capacity to take account of inevitable instances of plant not being available. In the old paradigm this did, in most times, just reduce to forced outage rates for plant – though there was the addition of energy limitations during the drought of 2007 as well. In the emerging new paradigm, this allowance will also have to take account of other variables such as sunshine intensity and wind speed. 2c) When is it required? Wedded to the question of how much capacity is required is the question about when it’s required to be delivered. Are we talking about a single capacity payment to ensure sufficient capacity for a peak (assumedly summer) demand – or are we talking about capacity payments that trickle each day throughout a year depending on the expected peak demand for a given month, or day? Are we talking about procuring today for tomorrow, or procuring today for next summer (i.e. which does not allow enough time for new capacity to be built – which might be fine now, in an oversupplied market, but what about in a number of years time after the fleet of existing thermal plant has been retired)? Each approach has its own challenges. 2d) How does the market operator ensure this capacity is available when required? It’s almost 20 years ago now when I worked there, but my vague memory is that the flawed design of the capacity market that operated in the original electricity market of England and Wales was one of the reasons why the review of “the Pool” was launched back in 1997. My recollection is that the capacity payments were set a day ahead of delivery, based on the product of two metrics – LOLP (loss of load probability) and VOLL (value of lost load). These payments the generators effectively banked day-ahead – with then no penalties for not actually turning up the next day to deliver that capacity. My recollection of this situation in EPEW was that this was a double-bounty for (portfolio) generators as they were then able to achieve higher prices on the spot market on the day of delivery because of less capacity being available. Perhaps one of our readers can confirm this for me? Regardless of whether this specific recollection is correct, or not, my sense is that it illustrates the 2nd vexed issue with respect to capacity payments – capacity is an intangible commodity. The only way to “prove” that capacity is actually available is to dispatch the capacity – but the nature of capacity procurement is such that the buyer needs to procure some percentage more than they actually need at any given point in time. Hence the energy user (who inevitably ends up paying) is left paying for a service they don’t even know is there, and can’t even know is there. What’s more, if it turns out not to be there (oops, my boiler tube has a leak – or the clouds are covering my sun – or …) then it’s the energy users that end up carrying the can for that as well. There would be different methods for working within the constraints of this issue – with each plausible option invariably involving some aspect of “socialising cost or risk”, for the alternative (opening discrete generation units up to damages for not delivering) would probably prove a very expensive option as this risk would be priced into the offers provided. 3) If a Capacity Market was introduced, could Demand Response also participate? If a capacity market were to be introduced, it seems logical that Demand Response should also be allowed to play a role in providing capacity reserve. * Note that we have been active for more than a decade in facilitating this form of Demand Response in the NEM. A growing number of energy users are operating in this manner (some with our help, some independently). Some have become very sophisticated in their operations, fine-tuning their curtailment decisions with respect to such parameters as: (a) The size of their order book; and (b) Their production lead time. The proposed design of the confusingly-named “Demand Response Mechanism” (discussed here and here previously) arose as a compromise solution because the NEM was designed, and has operated to date, as an energy-only market (i.e. without capacity payments), notwithstanding the effect of the RET (thus far, at least). Having not heard more about the status of this proposed reform for some time, I wonder where it is at? Should a capacity market be introduced, and Demand Response able to play a role in that space, it’s clear that the role for the DRM goes away. However the challenges noted above (in terms of “proving” that purchased capacity is available) are just as present – perhaps even moreso – with “negawatt” demand response than they are with physical “posa-watt”(?) capacity. As discussed at the bottom of this article my sense is that this stems from a conflict between what is (commercially) non-firm consumption and assumed firm (but actually non-firm) reductions from that non-firm consumption amount. 4) How might this fit in with RET payments? As noted above, the call for the introduction of capacity markets has arisen only because of the effect that an external revenue stream (the Renewable Energy Target) is having on the operation of the broader National Electricity Market. Whilst the addition of a third revenue stream into the mix (in the form of Capacity Payments) might “solve” the issues created with the addition of the second revenue stream ( the RET payments), what other issues might arise due to the interaction of all three revenue streams together in an increasingly complicated energy market? My concern is that moves in this way might be described as “jumping from frying pan into the fire”… I wrote previously about how the RET does have the effect of layering into a market that’s already complicated other aspects of “socialising costs whilst privatising profits” . That’s the reality – though (as noted in the same article and in this follow-up) it’s far from the only example of such cost-shifting. Please refer again to our FULL DISCLOSURE 1 about how we strive to remain technology agnostic. Our role is just to make the complexity in the energy market more understandable – whatever its rules of operation just happen to be. We hope that, by doing this, negative unintended consequences of policy choices that governments choose to make on behalf of their constituents can be reduced. This Powershop video does a great job of explaining how a single dispatch interval works in the NEM, but does not talk about any of the inter-temporal effects that are inherent in each dispatch interval. My sympathy for anyone who tries to explain more complex nuances such as this in a similar pithy way! The additional layering of a capacity payment into the mix, whilst making visible a “cost” that is now largely hidden in the balance sheets of incumbent generators, has the potential to make any discussion about “cash paid out by energy users” of any particular measure even more difficult to describe clearly. ——- Should any of our readers be able to point to substantial pieces of thinking about any of the above, please do note them below (or even just let me know of them, offline) in order that I can add them to the mix as well?",

    "title": "Queensland electricity demand hits a high mark on Thursday 5th March 2015",
    "date": "05-03-2015 03:57:00 PM",
    "content": "For a couple of reasons today (including the hot weather forecast for today, and the release yesterday of another interim upgrade to NEM-Watch v10 ) we opted to invest some time today to look at the level reached for Queensland demand today. What’s happened thus far in “extended summer” 2014-15 to date Back on 24th December, we posted these general comments about what might be expected in the Queensland region over the extended summer period for 2014-15. At that time, the Queensland demand had already peaked at 8,472MW on 17th December 2014 (a high level, but still 500MW or so off the record). In that post, I wrote about whether the increase in upstream compression would result in Queensland defying the overall trend of declining demand . In particular, we noted how it was of interest that this peak occurred later in the day than would have been the case several years ago, with solar PV hollowing out scheduled demand when the sun shines strongly. On 14th January, we also noted about the mysterious jump in Queensland demand observed (late 2014) by our friends at Pitts & Sherry. Hence, we thought it useful to recap, in the following chart from NEM-Review , what’s actually happened with respect to QLD demand so far over this “extended summer” period through until 31st March 2015: The key takeaway, at least from the perspective of those in the running to win competition #2 , and those more generally interested in the peakiness of electricity demand in the National Electricity Market, is that the result on 17th December has since been exceeded – with the new “highest so far” demand being 8,610MW . This occurred on Thursday 15th January 2015. Again, we note this was achieved later in the day – as aggregated solar PV injections was in its end-of-day decline. A detailed look at Thursday 5th March 2015 Hence this brings us to Thursday 5th March – a day on which I indulged my natural curiosity to have a closer look: Forecast on Monday 2nd March This curiosity was peaked on Monday this week, when we noticed weather warnings – and so posted these early comments about what was forecast to be a high demand day today. In particular, under the 50% POE weather scenario in ST PASA, the forecast peak was only around 8,250MW . Forecast on Wednesday 4th March Wednesday morning we looked in NEM-Watch v10.0.1 and GasWatch mobile and prepared this mashup highlighting how gas prices on Wednesday were helping to explain the high prices seen in the electricity market (and vice-versa). At the end of the working day, we looked forward into the following day and saw that the forecast peak demand for Thursday was in excess of 8,500MW (so higher than the 50% POE forecast had been in PASA on Monday). I tweeted this annotated image from NEM-Watch v10.0.2 (with a chart from GasWatch added in for the broader picture) to highlight potential issues: However we’ve lived through many instances where forecasts have not quite worked out in reality – hence we were uncertain what would actually happen on the day. As it unfolded on the day… It was of interest that we arrived at work this morning to see what was then forecast, as shown in the following snapshot from NEM-Watch at 08:45 NEM time: At that point we’d resolved to invest some time today in digging further, and preparing this post. At 15:15 we took (and tweeted) this snapshot of the market highlighting how (adjusting for approximately 500MW of solar PV injections behind the meter) the Queensland demand was very close to the historical record: As 15:55 the demand had passed the 8,500MW mark and was on its way higher (with temperatures high but solar output already well down from its peak* of 710MW at 11:40 this morning): * incidentally, the peak QLD solar output today (710MW at 11:40) was not far off the highest we’ve seen through summer (747MW a couple days ago). As the afternoon progressed, demand continued to grow. This snapshot from 16:50 shows a massive QLD Dispatch Demand Target of 8,892MW which was only 51MW below the all-time record. This is even more remarkable when considering that the solar injections into the grid at that time were estimated by APVI to be about 173MW – meaning that, adjusting for solar, a new peak in demand (9,065MW) was achieved at this point . It’s also worth pointing out in the above, with respect to demand levels being achieved, that there’s plenty of demand response activity we’re seeing as well in response to price volatility (though this was also the case in the peak reached in 2009-10). Given that solar has been progressively declining through the afternoon with the path of the setting sun, we’ve stuck around for a while to see what eventuates in terms of dispatch target demand As a brief PS to the post completed yesterday … By 18:00 on Thursday, demand was well and truly declining, so I headed home for the day – so it was with some surprise that I saw that, by 19:00 (as shown here in this snapshot from NEM-Watch v10.0.1 ) that demand had climbed back up , almost to that same level again: As noted on the image above, we presume that home air-conditioning load contributed significantly to this significant jump in after-work demand. One further outcome of the volatility yesterday is that the Cumulative Price for Queensland (the rolling total of 7 days of trading prices) had risen at that time to almost $100,000 (on Friday morning it’s above $110,000) – hence well on its way to the Cumulative Price Threshold (the level at which AEMO steps in to cap prices for the region). What this means for those in the running for a BBQ prize With respect to our summer BBQ give-away (and in particular competition #2 in this instance) we have a few entrants sweating on what happens to the lucky forecaster who is closest to the mark with their forecast for the maximum Queensland regional demand over this 4-month “extended summer” period. This chart sums up the situation, with most entrants already out of the running as a result of the high level of demand experienced today: This leaves a much smaller number of entries (under 10%) still in the running for the BBQ. Those entrants will have to wait for April to see who gets the prize…",

In NEM-Watch this morning, we see that the Queensland demand is in the green zone (in the middle of its historical range) and that the AEMO is forecasting in predispatch that the Queensland demand today might reach up towards 7,800MW (that’s more than 1,000MW below the all-time record – and below what we have been expecting the peak will be – so nothing to shout about). Looking further into the future this week with the ST PASA view within ez2view , we see the 50% POE demand forecast shows that (under the weather conditions assumed for the 50% case) the demand in Queensland might reach 8,250MW on the day. As shown in the table below, this compares to a higher forecast of 8,606MW under the 10% POE (extreme weather) demand forecast. Now that would make for a more noteworthy day!

    "title": "Where’s the increased output we expected to see with new wind farms?",
    "date": "25-02-2015 03:43:00 PM",
    "content": "Frequent readers will understand that we are particularly keen watchers of what’s happening in the National Electricity Market. Coupled with this underlying interest, we’re giving a portable BBQ away to the lucky forecaster who is closest to the mark with their forecast for the maximum wind farm output over an extended summer period. Hence we’ve been interested to see what’s happened over summer, to date. 1) Who’s still in the running for the competition? Back in early December, we provided these tips in terms of how wind output had trended over the period since late 2005 (when AEMO started publishing data). The chart has been copied here, for ease of reference: As can be seen in that chart, wind output had stepped up in mid 2014 with the commissioning of new plant, and was bumping around 2,900MW at times of peak output . It was with interest, then, when we tallied up the range of entries received over the few weeks we allowed entries in the competition to see the consensus view was that peak output would not be more than 3,000MW (and would, in fact, be pretty similar to what we’d seen in the preceding months). This was a bit of a surprise to us, as we were aware of a couple wind farms that we were expecting to begin generation through the summer period. Hence it was with interest that we have kept an eye on what’s happened, thus far. 2) So far this summer? Powering up NEM-Review and looking back over all days that have elapsed in summer to date, we see that the there have been only 2 days so far this summer where the wind output has peaked anywhere near that historic level (3 days above 2,500MW and only 2 above 2,700MW): Hence, whilst some low-ball entries are already out of the money, it does appear that the consensus view is reasonably close to where peak wind output has tracked this summer (at least so far). So, we wondered, why was it that we were expecting something higher…? 3) Having a closer look During 2014 we invested considerable time and effort in the updating of our “Power Supply Schematic” Market Map wall chart (2014 Issue) as highlighted here: Part of this job required us to update a long list of generation projects under consideration in the left column highlighted above. In this wall chart we used light blue to indicate wind farms (many different types of generation, so lots of different colours used). In the left column we can see a significant amount of light blue, reflecting the large amount of capacity at various stages of development (pending the long-awaited outcome of the RET Review ). Note that not all of those projects could be called “shovel ready” – some are but a glimmer in some developer’s eye – but a sizeable amount is, awaiting PPA as a sign to proceed. At the time we completed this chart (early September), stations under construction were also listed on the left and not the right (operational) column. Looking back to the start of 2011, we can see the following as an approximate trend in aggregate capacity of wind farms in the NEM: The four most recent additions (for which output data is now being published by AEMO) are highlighted. We had been assuming (without really looking at these specifics) that these new entrants would increase the chances of peak output being higher. However on closer note we see that only three wind farm operational start dates are remotely close to summer 2014-15 – as highlighted in this NEM-Review chart which shows averages for the day (as distinct from daily peaks): For scale purposes, I’ve also included the daily average output production from the large Macarthur wind farm on the chart. 3a) Boco Rock Wind Farm As noted above, Boco Rock output will have been already taken into account in the maximum monthly figures shown in the top chart for the months of October, November and December 2014. As we can see in the following detailed (half-hourly) view, the station’s peak output had reached its registered capacity by early December 2014: Hence no additional uplift can be expected for the remainder of summer. 3b) Taralga Wind Farm The same chart is shown below for the Taralga wind farm. As can be seen, metered generation (to date) has only reached about 40% of the registered capacity for the station. We have not checked but expect that this has something to do with the commissioning schedule of individual turbines onsite. Depending on how this commissioning progresses, we might see an additional 50-60MW contribution at times of peak wind farm output. 3a) Bald Hills Wind Farm Finally, the same chart is shown here for Bald Hills wind farm – indicating very early days at that station (it has been publishing data these past few weeks, but they are mostly zeros): On the project site here , it was still noting that expected date of full operations is “early 2015”. According to this article , it may be June 2015 before we see it fully operational. Hence we’re not sure how much contribution Bald Hills might make to maximum aggregate output by 31st March. Incidentally, we’ve been thinking about whether there are better ways of tracking project status, and would like to hear from you if this is also a concern of yours. Please please email us if you would also like to find a better way. 4) How you might track this yourself… 4a) For a free view For those who want to view what’s happening in the NEM from time-to-time, in relation to what type of fuel types are being used to generate each MWh of energy, then we would invite you to bookmark and return to this widget/page we’ve teamed up with the RenewEconomy team to provide: It’s one more service we’ve started to provide with the intent of continuing to make the complexity in the NEM understandable to a broad range of people. We’re keen to hear from your feedback, once you have had a chance to review this site – hence please let us know what you think ! 4b) For more detail, still at a fair price For a fuller view of which fuel type is generating what, and how this is impacting on price (and other) outcomes across all regions of the NEM, we’d invite you to run your own copy of NEM-Watch as a 24×7 dashboard in a central place in your office. Here’s a view of version 10 beta (release coming soon): 4c) To find out who wins the portable BBQ To learn who wins the competition, we’d suggest you set a reminder to come back and visit WattClarity in April, when the winners for all 7 competitions will be announced. Of course we hope that you’d be finding the articles we post here, including those of our growing number of guest authors , to be of value in the meantime….

    "date": "23-02-2015 11:06:00 AM",
    "content": "We know of people on the mainland who see Tasmania’s role in the NEM as nothing more than an alternating load or generation at the end of the Basslink subsea DC interconnector, but we have a number of clients on the island so (for this and other reasons) do take an interest in what’s happening there. We noticed this morning a significant drop in demand starting in the 1:05 dispatch interval this morning (so 2:05 Tassie time) – as can be seen here in this snapshot from a beta of the new NEM-Watch v10 : As shown, the Basslink interconnector tripped this morning around 1:55am Tassie time . Because Basslink was importing to Tasmania at the time, and because night-time Tasmanian demand was already low – hence local spinning reserve capability was low, this triggered the tripping of a number of approximately 600MW of load (industrial loads and probably residential load as well). AEMO published 3 Market Notices early this morning (highlighted above in NEM-Watch, and opened below) that explain further: As shown in the Market Notices highlighted, AEMO had to intervene in the market to direct a participant to maintain the system in a stable operating state (there’s not many participants in Tasmania, so you can probably guess who).",

    "title": "Forecasting NSW peak demand is not as easy as it might initially seem – is there a better way?",
    "date": "28-01-2015 04:20:00 PM",
    "content": "It’s past Australia Day, so Australia’s long, lazy, summer holiday season is at an end. As people drift back into work this week, having been trapped in the inevitable “back to school” (peak demand) traffic snarls, we turn our minds to wondering just what summer will bring, with respect to peak electricity demand. Particularly today, given all the press about the clash between the NSW Government’s network privatisation plans, the draft rulings from the Regulator and the understandable response from industry, I’m thinking about NSW. As a related question, I am wondering what the peak demand will turn out to be in NSW this summer. Demand (particularly peak demand) plays such a key role in these sorts of consideration – how hard can it be to forecast? 1) What does recent evidence suggest? Frequent readers of WattClarity will have noted that we’re giving away seven BBQs this summer to those entrants who show that they are good at forecasting some of the key metrics important to both infrastructure development, and to market operations. It’s a bit of fun over Christmas – but it does have a serious side, as we are keenly interested in analysing the results of this (highly unscientific) survey to see where there is greatest alignment (and, conversely, greatest divergence of views) about what might happen to these metrics. With some attractive personal inducement (at least to the entrants) in the form of the prizes, we secure entries from a diverse bunch of people – including people who, in their “day jobs”, have a keen interest in being able to forecast such metrics for their own businesses. We understand that these metrics do play a key role in the core business of many of the companies operating in, or looking to enter, Australia’s National Electricity Market . In the case of NSW peak demand (our competition #3), the following distribution indicates that there is a significant spread of entries from “industry insiders, commentators & spectators” that (we think) typifies the challenge of correctly forecasting metrics such as peak electricity demand: Figure 1 = spread of forecasts from NEM participants, spectators & commentators Let’s say that the peak demand lands somewhere between 12,500MW and 13,000MW (which is what the consensus view is this summer). For a peak demand at that level, we see a spread of over ± 2000MW (or ± 16% of that hypothetical level) in the forecasts received …. and these are forecasts made even as summer is already underway ! One reader might take this to mean that our self-selecting group of demand forecasters is not altogether that competent…. whilst another reader might infer from the above that they have been tasked with forecasting something that is, by it’s very nature, very difficult to forecast accurately. 2) So far this summer? To track how demand has fared in NSW so far this summer, we power up NEM-Review and produce the following trend of 30-minute (trading) data for the region: Figure 2 = trend of NSW demand in summer to date As can be seen here, the NSW has been depressed for summer-to-date, only scraping above 11,000MW on three separate occasions. The second chart here (also from NEM-Review ) compares 9 summers in a row for NSW to illustrate how low these peaks for summer 2014-15 to date have actually been. Figure 3 = comparison of this NSW summer with prior summers That this is the case is not surprising, given that the Kurri Kurri smelter closed in the 2012 year – adding a step-change decrease in demand to the pre-existing trend of declining demand (that has continued since then). However the question remains – where will the NSW demand peak this summer? It’s an important question (and not just for those who stand to win a BBQ on the answer). It’s also a challenge that’s central to future investment decisions in the generation, transmission and distribution sectors (plus the growing sector “behind the meter”) – as well as being central to the ongoing operations (and retirements) of existing assets. But the three charts above start to explain the story of why it’s such a difficult (and thankless) task . 3) What’s the “official” forecast for the remains of summer? Judging by Figure 3 above we can see that, whatever the peak demand will be for summer 2014-15, it’s highly likely to occur in the next week or two . We see that demand has always seemed to fall into a lull late in February and through March (except for that one spike shown for late March 2010). 3a) AEMO’s NEFR / ESOO forecast Back in August 2014, the AEMO published its Statement of Opportunities which included the demand forecast for summer 2014-15 (sourced from the NEFR from 2 months earlier, in June). We can use NEM-Watch to drill-in to see how those forecasts (under 9 different scenarios) compare with how summer is actually unfolding, as shown here: Figure 4 = demand in NSW today (being cold and wet) is way below what’s forecast for summer peak Using the higher-end dashboard, ez2view , we can look into two other demand forecasts produced over shorter-term time horizons – as follows: 3b) AEMO’s MT PASA forecast The AEMO’s MT PASA demand forecasts are updated once each week, and provide a view of peak daily demand under extreme (10%POE) and average (50%) weather conditions. The following is the view of the NSW demand forecast under the average weather scenario : Figure 5 = demand is expected to peak next week in NSW, according to AEMO’s MT PASA forecast As noted here, AEMO is forecasting a peak next week of around 12,000MW under the “average” weather scenario. 3c) AEMO’s ST PASA forecast Given that the MT PASA forecast (Figure 5) shows a demand peak expected next week , it’s particularly interesting to narrow the time-range of the inquiry and look into the ST PASA forecast (again within ez2view ). What we see is a very different story: Figure 6 = ST PASA forecast is 3,000MW lower… Because ST PASA is updated every 2 hours (compared to once per week for MT PASA) it can take account of changes to weather forecasts that are updated on a much more regular basis. Is this the only reason why the demand peak forecast now for next Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday is 3,000MW lower than was the case in the MT PASA forecast published yesterday afternoon (Tuesday 27th Jan)? Does this mean that next Thursday and Friday might be significantly hotter? If you know of other reasons, please help me (and our readers) out by adding your comments below… 4) Is forecasting becoming even more difficult? Back in 2008, we posted this analysis of the demand forecasts that had been made by TransGrid to that point in time. As could be seen then, the demand forecasting process was fraught with difficulty (no better than sticking a finger in the air too far out?). However since that time, it seems to me that the demand forecasting process has become even more difficult . With price elasticity of demand now clearly seen (at home, and at work), the rise of solar and other embedded generation behind the meter, and the potential rise of distributed storage, it’s becoming a “perfect storm” to make the future very cloudy. It’s also become much more politicised than was the case in 2008 when we posted that analysis following the conference I spoke at. (a) Since that time, the link between demand forecast rates and infrastructure development – and hence end prices (for the transport component, at least) to consumers has become much more apparent, and widely understood. (b) Coupled with this is the fact that we have privatisation (oops, leasing ☺ ) of network assets in Queensland and NSW, linked with billions of dollars of other investment promises, subject to two very contentious & imminent elections. Coincident with these elections are the AER’s decision process relating to revenue. Technology change is only part of the puzzle. Also playing a significant role in driving behaviour is pricing of energy delivery – and yet there does not seem to be anyone in particular in the driver’s seat on that front…. Because the horse has bolted with respect to cost-reflective network tariffs in the roll-out of distributed air-conditioning systems (*1) it has been seen by some as self-serving on the part of the network companies when “the sluggish battleship” finally starts to turn its direction and adjust its pricing methodology – coincident with the second technology change (*2). This is quite understandable (I’m not getting into the extent, or not, that it might be true – as, apart from anything else, I don’t really know). *1 = others have written of that aspect of “Socialising cost whilst privatising profit” *2 = The first technology change (air-conditioning) added to average demand in a big way (and peaks even more-so). The second technology change (solar PV) is having the opposite effect – reducing average demand and also reducing peak demand, hence shifting the time when scheduled peak demand occurs . Close on the horizon is the third big change (distributed storage), replete with its own challenges, as well. Given that the industry has not even dealt effectively with the first and the second, what hope is there that we can deal with the third? Many others have written about different aspects of storage (and solar, and air-conditioning). What puzzles me, today, is how anyone can be expected to have a reasonable stab on where demand will be in 6, 7 or 8 years time with all of these moving parts (and more). As shown in Figure 1 above, we can’t even accurately forecast what the peak demand will be in the summer that’s right upon us… 5) Surely there must be a better way? I don’t have any answers, but I am pondering this question… For those who don’t know, in a former life ( see here ) I did play a role in developing a probabilistic scenario planning methodology to assist network companies dealing with the mismatch between an uncertain market environment and the need for firm revenue plans. If we assume, for a moment, that all parties are altruistic, the cards still do seem to be stacked against the chances of achieving a reasonable and cost-effective outcome for energy users who are, at the end of the day, the people (and companies) that foot the bill for all players operating in the market (including new technology providers). My experience is similar to what Luke has noted in that, from the broad cross-section of people who I have the privilege of speaking with and serving, I find most genuinely interested in helping to meet the principles espoused in the National Electricity Objective. On the flip side, there have been those rare few who have been out looking after number 1, and they’ve not been uniquely located in any particular segment of the industry. I wonder, for instance, if asking network companies to submit firm revenue requirements out up to 7 years into the future (i.e. from the time the numbers are first crunched) is just asking for trouble – with the inevitable boom/bust cycle that seems to have threatened the industry for as long as I can remember.",

    "content": "With the heatwave that Brisbane experienced over the past few days, and the ensuing volatility that resulted, our attention has been mainly focused closer to home here. We had noticed that Victorian demand has been very low over the same period as a result of the cool weather (perhaps “unseasonal” given the Australian Open has commenced). However we noticed this tweet from AusNet Services today announcing a return to the heat we expect to see in Victoria around this time of year: AusNet Services’ Critical Peak Demand Tariff programme is one useful way of harnessing the power of demand response to lower the cost of networks in all customer’s bills (and a program that we know some of our customers use to augment the demand response benefits they enjoy in the energy market ). Shortly afterwards, when AEMO’s predispatch forecasts rolled out to encompass all of tomorrow, we saw a clear picture in NEM-Watch of how the two regions in question are faring: So we see Victorian demand rising from the amazingly low levels experienced over the weekend to be forecast to peak at almost double those levels tomorrow afternoon (though still more than 2,000MW below the all-time record experienced back here ).

    "title": "Factors contributing to declining demand during 2014",
    "date": "16-01-2015 01:07:00 PM",
    "content": "With energy and greenhouse continuing to be under the spotlight during 2015 we thought it useful to have a look at what happened in the National Electricity Market (NEM) during 2014. [ This is a summary of a more detailed paper that I put together which can be downloaded at www.greenmarkets.com.au .] Electricity consumption (measured as scheduled demand from NEM-Review ) in the NEM continued to fall in 2014, dropping by 1.1 per cent (2,098 GWh) compared to 2013 levels. Electricity consumption fell in all states except Queensland which increased by 0.9 per cent. Victoria experienced the biggest fall of 3.5 per cent due largely to the closure of the Point Henry aluminium smelter at the end of July 2014. Figure 1) Metered scheduled demand from 2006 to 2014 The reduction in electricity consumption masks the contribution that solar and energy efficienc y activities have made. We estimate that solar installations supported by the Renewable Energy Target and energy efficiency activities supported by the various state based schemes will have contributed 1,877 GWh in 2014 or 89 per cent of the observed reduction in demand for 2014. Nearly 700 MW a year of roof-top solar PV was installed in NEM states and created certificates under the Renewable Energy Target over the 2013 and 2014 period. This is estimated to have generated an additional 963 GWh in 2014 and accounts for 46 per cent of the reduction in overall consumption. The contribution of solar hot water and an array of energy efficiency activities supported by state based energy savings schemes (in Victoria, NSW, ACT and South Australia) have also contributed to lower electricity consumption (further 914 GWh). Figure 2) Reduction in electricity demand (2014 cf: 2013) There was a dramatic drop in the level of renewable generation in 2014, falling from 13.8 per cent share of the market to 11.8 per cent. This drop is due to a 25 per cent reduction in hydro generation levels and was only slightly offset by a 6.4 per cent increase in wind generation. Brown coal and gas-fired generation increased their output making up for the lower hydro generation. Brown coal-fired generation increased by 4 per cent and gas-fired generation increased by 11.5 per cent in 2014. Figure 3) Differences in metered generation by fuel (2014 cf: 2013) Wind generation increased by 6.4 per cent largely due the commencement of three new wind farms and a full year’s output of several wind farms that commenced operating late in 2013. Overall 2014 was less windy than 2013 with those wind farms that were fully operational on 1 January 2013 producing 11 per cent less in 2014 than in 2013. The average capacity factor for these wind farms dropped from 35.1 per cent in 2013 to 31.1 per cent in 2014. Wind accounted for 34 per cent of South Australia’s total generation in 2014, slightly higher than the 32 per cent achieved in 2013. Three new wind farms started generating for the first time in 2014; Boco Rocks (NSW), Taralga (NSW) and Snowtown 2 North in South Australia. Five fossil fuel plants ceased generating in 2014. Greenhouse gas emissions increased by 1 per cent in 2014, notwithstanding a 1.1 per cent reduction in electricity consumption. With the increase in fossil fuel generation, the emission intensity of the NEM increased by 2.1 per cent. This article is based on work originally published here and follows reporting of this at other locations such as at RenewEconomy . It has been included on WattClarity because it adds to the articles previously posted here about declining demand in the NEM (and is also a useful update to the analysis completed by Hugh Saddler for the Australia Institute in Dec 2013 ).

    "title": "Three sample approaches (of 173 worldwide) to integrating renewables into the grid",
    "date": "15-01-2015 01:36:00 PM",
    "content": "The dramatic rise in renewable energy generators connecting to the grid is transforming the traditional electricity supply chain – particularly small-scale embedded generators (primarily solar PV) connecting to the distribution network. This transformation is by no means smooth sailing for those involved, and there are a number of issues that have been raised impacting the successful and sustained integration of more renewables into the grid. These include commercial and economic issues such as the impact on network business models and the costs of connection and integration, as well as technical issues such as reverse energy flows and reliability issues related to intermittency. But are these issues valid? Have they been successfully addressed by projects, studies or trials in other parts of the world? Are international solutions transferable to the Australian market? Marchment Hill’s recent analysis of projects from around the globe has revealed some innovative approaches to integrating more renewables into the grid. We highlight three of these below. Example 1) The eTelligence project (EWE AG) The eTelligence project provides important tools for the future by intelligently linking the fields of telecommunication, IT and energy. Germany’s aim to obtain 50% of its energy from renewables by the year 2030 was already realised in the Cuxhaven region in 2008, where the urgency to look for new solutions is already evident. EWE has set the course for the future with its eTelligence project in Cuxhaven by linking large and small-scale consumers and producers via ICT technologies into an intelligent system. “the foundations have been laid for the energy supply system of the future” The Cuxhaven model demonstrates how the regional balance between generation and consumption can contribute to security of supply and how ICT, in combination with existing energy structures can enable the optimisation of distributed energy supply. As a result, the foundations have been laid for the energy supply system of the future, by creating an efficient system that integrates distributed energy resources intelligently into the energy system. It is worth noting that the eTelligence project addresses most of the renewable integration issues recognised by the industry ranging from commercial, economic to technical aspects, with a number of innovative concepts. What makes it special? The fundamental elements of the project include the Regional Marketplace, the Virtual Power Plant and the Intelligent Distribution Network. The eTelligence marketplace The digital energy marketplace enabled small and medium-sized power-generating systems, as well as medium to large electricity consumers, to trade energy products in a fully automated way. Plant operators did not need any extra know-how or extra time to participate in the electricity market and they were still able to achieve excellent prices when generation and consumption by the power plants, and renewable energy supply followed the requirements of the overall energy system. EWE TRADING also offered a link with the wholesale market to ensure sufficient liquidity on the marketplace. Some of the market participants included EWE NETZ GmbH, various cogeneration plants and a virtual power plant consisting of a PV system, a wind farm and two refrigerated warehouses. Active distribution network In order to understand the network behaviour, network measurement data (active and reactive power, voltages, currents, frequency) was collected from 100 substations in the distribution network, saved and exported on request. The data was recorded for the participation of the network in the regional marketplace. The installation of sensor and feedback technologies is the key in order to overcome infrastructural challenges related to the successful integration of renewable energy resources. It is an innovative approach which helps to avoid the expansion of the electricity network, helps to support the integration of renewable resources, and offers a major economic advantage. Figure 1: Participants in the eTelligence marketplace (eTelligence) The savings and load shift potential of the energy consumers were also evaluated in 650 households. The most important instruments for this were customer specific tariff incentives and the use of intelligent metering technology (smart meters), as well as the feedback of electricity consumption in real time. On average, electricity consumption was reduced by 11% with the real-time visualisation, which leads to higher energy savings and lower CO2 emissions. What can we learn from this? The technical and operational ability to create a far more efficient energy supply system exists. This new approach recognises and embraces the decentralised nature of the modern energy “ecosystem” and creates efficiencies for customers and value for the members of the supply chain. The challenge for the Australian electricity market is to remove the regulatory and commercial barriers that prevent this future operating model from becoming the norm. “The technical and operational ability to create a far more efficient energy supply system exists” Example 2) Jeju Island Smart Renewable Project To achieve South Korea’s national greenhouse gas emission reduction goal, establishing Low-Carbon Green Growth Infrastructure is an urgent task for the Korean energy industry. To promote the use of renewable energy, distributed energies and electric vehicles, which cannot be accommodated with its existing network infrastructure, establishing a smart renewable system is the key in this project: South Korea needs to foster the smart grid industry as a new growth engine that surpasses semi-conductors and IT products: they expect exponential growth in the world smart grid market. A great ripple effect in the economy is expected not only in the power and heavy electric industries but also in the related key industries of South Korea, including telecommunication, smart home appliances, construction, electric vehicles, and energy. South Korea aims to create more jobs in the highly value-added renewable energy industry, as well as creating various new business models. What makes it special? South Korea’s renewable integration and technology development are the result of its national strategic planning. Commercial, economic, and environmental benefits are among the key drivers. The Korean government also seeks to create the synergy between renewable development and other key national industries that are already playing an important role in the world market, especially the home appliance and automobile industries. The Korean National Road Map committee, which is composed of approximately 130 experts from industry, academia, and R&D, collects expert opinions through interviews and workshops. It also holds hearings to solicit the opinions of experts and citizens who do not participate in the committee, with a view to developing a National Road Map for the smart grid and renewable integration to lead the low-carbon green growth in Korea. The Jeju Island project embodies the Korean government’s long-term holistic vision. It is estimated that establishing the smart grid will not only solve Korea’s future energy problems and improve the quality of life, but will also bring other benefits such creating new jobs, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, lowering dependence on energy imports, increasing exports, creating domestic consumption, and avoiding the need to build new power plants. Figure 2: Estimated job creation of renewable and smart grid development in South Korea (KSGI) Figure 3: Estimated export contribution from renewable and smart grid development in South Korea (KSGI) What can we learn from this? Having a strong, national, coordinated and stable strategy for the transition to a low-carbon economy, which recognises the transformation the grid must undertake to support renewable energy targets, has a huge impact on the ability for that country to undertake ambitious projects to support that transition. While the project is ongoing, it has the potential to give South Korea a significant competitive advantage in the global market for smart technology. Example 3) Orkney Island Smart Grid The electricity network on the Orkney Islands is served by two 33 kV circuits of 20MW import/export each connected to the Scottish mainland. The existing generation at the outset of the project included 21 MW of capacity that could be automatically ‘intertripped’ in the event of an outage on one of the circuits to the mainland regardless of the demand on the Islands. According to conventional planning standards, the Orkney network was “full”. Scottish & Southern Energy Power Distribution (SSEPD) sought a quicker and more cost-effective way to provide further wind generation than the traditional approach of costly and time-consuming upgrades to the network including an additional subsea cable, which would cost about A$50 million. It also wanted to: Facilitate bankable connections for new generators Minimise dependency on operator and manual actions. What makes it special? An active network management system was developed which curtails the real-time output of participating generators, demand or storage devices, to manage capacity constraints when they arise. It included dynamic line ratings assessment. Generators are instructed directly under automated controls to limit their power output to match the available export capacity to the mainland grid. Crucial to the scheme was agreement on defining the grid access arrangements including the real-time curtailment of wind generation output when necessary. “The Orkney network is a blueprint for how power companies can use smart grids to connect high levels of renewable generation cost effectively to resolve grid congestion” This approach was modelled and the curtailment forecasts were found to be acceptable to the banks who finance the schemes. There are now 20 generators with a capacity of 24MW, and in 2013 Orkney became a net exporter of renewable energy with 100% of local demand met by wind. Smarter Grid Solutions’ technology has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of the electricity distribution network in the UK. The Orkney network is a blueprint for how power companies can use smart grids to connect high levels of renewable generation cost effectively to resolve grid congestion. The total cost of developing and delivering this innovative technical solution was less than A$850k. To connect similar levels of renewable generation by reinforcing the network in the conventional way, it would have cost around A$50 million, and taken considerably longer. What can we learn from this? Integrating more renewables into areas of network constraint can be achieved with efficient outcomes if networks and generators work together to understand the constraints and the technical and commercial options available.

    "date": "14-01-2015 01:54:00 PM",
    "content": "In recent weeks we’ve fielded questions from a number of different parties about a mysterious jump in Queensland demand that some have observed late in 2014. Pitts & Sherry in this Cedex report for January note that: “Demand would have been even lower, were it not for the sharp increase seen in Queensland. The data suggest that this is entirely attributable to a very large new continuous industrial load of around 400 MW , which came on line on 27 October. The identity of this load appears, surprisingly, to be commercial in confidence. It is about the same size as either one of the two recently closed aluminium smelters. In a full year, a load of this size would add about 3.5 TWh to annual electricity demand, equal to almost 2 % of current NEM demand and over 7% of Queensland demand prior to its connection.” Hugh Saddler (of Pitts & Sherry) also added a question for WattClarity readers in the comments on this post . For those without the same ability, the following trend from NEM-Review of daily demand extremes in Queensland shows the change described: We’ve begun a process of digging further, to see what we can find – this we will fit in with other priorities, so an answer won’t be immediate.

    "content": "Yesterday evening I received an advert for the latest joint UQ + Grattan Institute event in Brisbane on Thursday 5th February provocatively titled “Gas: too good to burn?” . Upon reaching the office this morning and reviewing our series of dashboards, I was confronted with this stark reminder from GasWatch : No, that’s not a misprint. At a price of $8.69/GJ today at the Brisbane hub , it seems that there surely are people falling over themselves to gain access to short-term gas. Eight-buck-gas would be newsworthy at any particular time of year – at least for the east coast (with the west having been stung a long time ago), and particularly for Queensland given the low gas prices seen at the Brisbane hub through much of 2014 ( such as here in September ). In the prolonged holiday season, with a state election only a couple weeks away (one with some focus on gas and electricity), and with the first LNG deliveries leaving Gladstone, it makes does make for interesting reading – hence articles like this in the FinReview . In NEM-Watch yesterday, we saw how gas production volumes in Queensland had reduced through December: It’s important to note that gas has not entirely disappeared (far from it – for now, at least? ). Hence the title of the event might be tweaked to be “Gas – too good to burn for next-to-nothing in the middle of the night ” (though that is more of a mouthful). Powering up NEM-Review to look further back in history, we see the following trend of how generation from gas in Queensland grew from next-to-nothing in the early years to be given a kick-start in 2005 with the start of the Queensland Gas Scheme to the current point in time: At a more microscopic level, looking just from 1st July 2014 through to now and using NEM-Review to calculate daily gas burn at Queensland power stations, we see how some gas stations have had their production levels curtailed, whilst others are continuing to power on (at least for now). The other point that can be gleaned from the relative volumes of gas burn (keeping in mind that 1,000,000 MJ = 1TJ) is that the volumes of reduction in gas burn each day account for the same order of magnitude as the total quantities delivered at the Brisbane hub of the STTM. Bodes for interesting times at Queensland’s gas/electricity intersection through 2015. I will be interested to see what comes out of the discussions at State Library on 5th February. Whilst on the topic of conversations about gas, I can’t help but notice Keith Orchison’s promotions for the upcoming “Australian Domestic Gas Outlook 2015” conference on 23/24/25/26 March . Might also be useful for those who are interested. [Note that we’re not associated with either event in any way – just mention them as a service to our readers]",

    "title": "National regulations encourage new entrant retailers",
    "date": "07-01-2015 12:05:00 PM",
    "content": "The emergence of new entrant energy retailers represent a significant threat to the ‘big three’ . There are a number of reasons for this and the story is set to play out further in 2015. (1) New retailers approved Attracted by the prospect of taking market share and retail margin, a large number of new entrant retailers have applied for and been granted retail authorisations from the Australian Energy Regulator. In the last 18 months, the Australian Energy Regulator has granted nine electricity retail authorisations, together with more than 35 individual exemptions from the requirement to hold an electricity retail authorisation (typically companies offering solar PPAs). Combined number of current gas and electricity authorisations issued by the Australian Energy Regulator Source: www.aer.gov.au/node/1265 as of 15/11/2014 (2) National Regulations making it easier to join the party The gradual implementation of the National Energy Consumer Framework (NECF) (currently applicable in NSW, SA, TAS and ACT) has had the effect of emboldening new entrant electricity retailers. The NECF means that a company can apply to the AER to retail electricity in all NECF jurisdictions, whereas they would previously have to apply in each separately. The harmonisation of energy retail regulations as a result of the implementation of the NECF has most certainly made it easier for electricity retailers to comply with their obligations and for new companies to enter the market (refer to www.aemc.gov.au/Energy-Rules/Retail-energy-rules/Guide-to-application-of-the-NECF for a summary of the NECF). Electricity retail is a highly regulated industry (perhaps to the benefit of not only consumers but also lawyers…). The rules cover the operational, technical and financial aspects of energy retail (in other words, basically everything) and are there to ensure integrity and reliability of the market as well as for the protection of consumers. (3) Less actual or perceived volatility in the market The three main barriers to entry for new entrant retailers are: 1) lack of understanding of the wholesale market and the risk management tools required; 2) lack of capital to support the operational, wholesale and prudential requirements; and 3) concern about the volatility of the price of electricity on the wholesale market. On the first point, there are plenty of great tools such as NEM-Watch to assist in understanding the market. On the second point, there are also a few investors who are okay with a lack of return for a few years whilst a retailer is established. On the third point, new entrant retailers have been watching the market and can see that there has been less volatility in pricing since 2009-2010. They also appreciate that this trend is likely to continue, as we have excess generation and falling demand thanks to demand side efficiency and solar (and soon with battery storage). With new and proposed regulations further restricting the operation of generators and others, new entrant retailers also appreciate that there is less opportunity for them to be ‘gamed’ by the other players in the market. (4) Consolidation in the Middle Whilst the bottom end of the market is getting crowded, there is space in the middle. As noted in a previous WattClarity article, ‘Incumbent Retailers under siege on both sides’ : “Since the NEM started many years ago, we’ve seen the initial group of retailers grow smaller and smaller over time – as Origin, AGL and EnergyAustralia have gobbled up pretty much everyone else who was there at the start.” New entrant retailers see this gap in the market and most are looking to eventually get into that space. New entrant retailers also sense that many incumbents operate with inefficiencies , struggle with legacy billing systems, and generally think they can do a better job. Lastly, new entrant retailers know that there will be more acquisitions and there will be further consolidation . For many new entrant retailers, particularly those with a small base of investors, the exit strategy is a sale within the next five years. (5) Consumer malaise presents opportunity Consumer dissatisfaction with current providers provides leverage to new entrant retailers, who are keenly aware that people don’t have a great degree of loyalty towards their existing energy retailers. After all, it is hard to develop a brand around a product that no one can touch or see. The only experience people have with their electricity retailer is when they receive their bills, or when the lights go out (and when they do, they blame the retailer not the network company). Customer dissatisfaction with electricity retailers has risen dramatically over the past five years. This is partly a result of affordability issues, as the price paid by consumers has risen dramatically and people have been struggling to pay their bills. Customers don’t necessarily see a distinction between network components and the retail margin represented in their bill. Last financial year, the Energy and Water Ombudsman NSW (EWON) received 30,349 electricity related complaints (see page 18: EWON Annual Report 2012-2013 ). Although compared with the previous year this increase was noted as ‘modest’, in comparison to the number of electricity complaints to EWON in 2010-2011, it represented an increase of 153 per cent (see page 14: EWON Annual Report 2010-2011 ). Similar figures were seen in other States. In Victoria in 2012-13, there were 56,795 electricity cases reviewed by the Energy and Water Ombudsman (Victoria) (EWOV) , representing an increase of 19 per cent from the previous year (see page 3: EWOV Annual Report 2012-2013 ). Seventy eight per cent of complaints received by EWON in 2012-2013 were lodged against the big three retailers Origin Energy, EnergyAustralia and AGL. Whilst those three supplied approximately 77 per cent of small electricity customers (see page 120: AER, State of the Energy Market 2013 ), the overall conclusion is that there are plenty of unhappy energy consumers—and their unhappiness is increasing. For a new retailer, this represents opportunity. It is much easier to keep 5000 customers happy than it is to satisfy 5,000,000 customers. Smaller retailers operating in niche markets are able to focus on higher margin customers and ensure that those customers are not lost in a legacy billing system. (6) Power to the People Consumers are responding positively to new entrant retailers. In 2012-2013, the combined market share of the top three fell by 2 per cent (see page 120: AER, State of the Energy Market 2013 ). Ultimately, the beneficiaries of increased choice will be energy consumers, not only in terms of pricing but also by improved customer service, better delivery of service, new products and blended offers co mbining grid energy with products such as solar. Watt-ch this Space With the larger number of retailers now operating, there is obviously a greater risk that one will fail or that consolidation of the market will be required (assuming that retail margins may not be as profitable as they currently are or are perceived to be). The financial capacity of electricity retailers will undoubtedly be a focus of energy retail regulators such as the AER, ESC and AEMO. One thing is certain; 2015 is shaping up to be an interesting year in the retail market. New entrant retailers are beginning to offer hybrid products combining grid energy with solar, lighting, energy management and, of course, storage. We are also likely to see stronger responses from incumbents to this increasing threat to their business model.

    "title": "Recapping prior peaks in NEM-wide demand",
    "date": "06-01-2015 03:53:00 PM",
    "content": "It’s Tuesday 6th January – so (counting today) entrants only have only 4 days remaining to submit their forecast for what the peak NEM-wide demand will be this extended summer period (1st Dec 2014 to 31st March 2015). This year there are 7 competitions running in parallel ( further details of all 7 here ) but, like prior years, it’s your forecast for peak NEM-wide demand that sets you up to win the main prize (Competition #1). Because entrants only get one chance with the main prize , many have been holding fire until this week (shortly to be updated here ) to place their entries for Competition #1. The following analysis might help them – and it can help you as well… 1) The extremes of prior summers With NEM-Review we have generated the following trend of demand extremes for every month since the start of the NEM, up to and including January 2015, but to only yesterday 5th January . Looking back over prior summers in particular, I note the following summaries previously provided at the time: Summer 2013-14 Following summer 2013-14 we posted this summary of highlights of how NEM-wide demand trended through the summer period.See in particular how there were only two separate hot spells during which demand rose above above 30,000MW – one of them being the week of Thursday 16th January, which was when the NEM-wide demand peak at 33,223MW . An AEMO staff member (Magnus Hindsberger) use a very scientific process to ensure he was within 0.26% of the mark. You might like to read Magnus’ comment at the bottom of this article , where he explains some of his method. Summer 2012-13 Summer 2012-13 saw fewer instances of demand peaking above 30,000MW – as shown in this summary published in March 2013 . The peak for that summer was 31,846MW .As noted here to follow , it was Joy Chan (of Delta Electricity) who just scraped past other colleagues at Delta, and the rest of the entrants, with an entry just shy of the mark – in a summer where the peak demand crept close to 32,000MW. Summer 2011-12 The La Nina summer of 2011-12 was very lacklustre (as shown here) , where the demand just scraped past 30,000MW on one day – and, on that day (24th February) it peaked at only 30,218MW . Winning entry from that summer was Aden Fanning (of InterGen). Summer 2010-11 As shown in this trend for summer 2010-11 , demand barely budged above 30,000MW – except for one stinking hot week where demand peaked at 35,004MW on Wednesday 2nd February 2011 . Winning entry for summer 2010-11 came from another AEMO staff member (Richard Hickling) who was – compared with winners in other years – further from the mark, but still close enough to win. Summer 2009-10 We did not run a competition over that summer period – must have been too busy?However we still did record in WattClarity these pieces of analysis of noteworthy events over the summer period. Summer 2008-09 The massive demand peak of 35,478MW ( discussed here ) set on 29th January 2009 might be (it seems) a record that stands for more years. At the time of writing this article, it is a peak that has not been bested.Various articles linked to analysis of this broader summer are included here . Every single forecast was blown out of the water in that summer – with the “least wrong” being Thao Doan (of Stanwell). Summer 2007-08 We also did not run a competition for summer 2007-08.There were a number of interesting developments over that summer period, including: (a) A very volatile weekend in Queensland; and (b) The extended heatwave experienced in South Australia through March 2008, if we’re using the current extended definition of summer. Summer 2006-07 Through summer 2006-07 we posted this series of articles in a summer that included a significant blackout. Winning entry this summer came from David Turnour (of Origin) – who was 129MW from the mark (0.4%) Summer 2005-06 In summer 2005-06 the daily peak demand rose above 30,000MW on perhaps 6 instances ( as shown here ), with the highest excursion being to 30,994MW late in January 2006.The winner for this summer was Trevor Persal (of Ergon Energy). Note, in the post linked here, the distribution of entries – and how most forecasters were way over the mark. Hence, the above summary of 9 prior summers (since Tasmania joined the NEM) reinforces how the demand – most of the time – has remained below 30,000MW for much of every summer period . On the occasions when extreme temperatures has driven demand higher, the peaks for the summer have been very much dependent on weather extremes in either NSW, or VIC+SA. We have not really seen extreme temperatures in QLD or TAS contribute to peak NEM-wide demand thus far… (or, noting another way, when extremes of demand were experienced in QLD in particular, demand in the south has been very moderate). 2) Trended distribution of NEM-wide demand To provide a little more context to help you with your single forecast for the main competition this summer, we’ve used NEM-Review to generate the following trended, coloured distribution of the incidence of NEM-wide demand each month (colouring the counts of demand in buckets above 30,000MW in green – as this is the area of particular interest to you). This follows from this analysis leading into summer 2011-12 , whereby in that case we aggregated up just to the (regular) summer periods of December, January, February. Note, in particular, that this prior analysis preceded the demand spikes above 33,000MW in summer 2013-14. 3) What does AEMO forecast for peak NEM-wide demand In the past couple weeks, as time has permitted and especially because each region has also been the focus of its own competition this summer (with more than one entry accepted for each of these). Queensland (Competition #2) On Christmas Eve, we posted this analysis of prior Queensland summers – and included some tips on what AEMO’s current forecasts suggest for what the peak regional demand for QLD might be this summer.Several readers have left clarifying comments, and forecasts have continued to be submitted each day since that time. NSW (Competition #3) We’ve not yet had a chance to provide a summary for NSW, and to update AEMO’s forecasts for that region – perhaps if time permits later this week, in time for your last entries. Victoria (Competition #4) On Friday 2nd January we posted this analysis of prior Victorian summers , and included some tips based on what AEMO’s forecasts are saying for peak Victorian demand this summer. South Australia (Competition #5) On Monday 29th December we posted this analysis of prior South Australian summers , and included tips based on what AEMO’s forecasts are saying for peak SA demand this summer. Tasmania (Competition #6) On New Year’s Eve we posted this analysis of prior Tasmanian summers , and included tips on AEMO’s forecast for the region.The consistency highlighted suggests (as noted in the article) the need to fine-tune your forecasts, certainly down to nearest whole number! The key message here (in terms of peak NEM-wide demand) is that, unlike peak regional demand, the AEMO does not really give you a hand , explicitly, by providing any forecasts for what the peak demand is likely to be across the NEM this summer. Now that you’ve considered the background above, don’t forget to email in your forecast for peak NEM-wide demand for extended summer 2014-15. You only get one entry, so make sure it counts!",

    "title": "Analysing trends in VIC electricity demand",
    "date": "02-01-2015 02:45:00 PM",
    "content": "We’ve rolled into 2015, and you now have only 8 days (counting today) to email your entry in to win a portable BBQ in Competition #4 (peak VIC demand this summer), one of 7 separated, but similar, competitions we’re running this summer to celebrate 15 years of service. In the process of writing this analysis, we can’t avoid noticing the forecasts for extreme weather in Victoria today and tomorrow, with the state of the market this morning captured in the following NEM-Watch snapshot: The following analysis could prove useful for those still contemplating their remaining 8 entries (remembering that you can enter once each day – in Competition #4 – till Friday 9th January with this one). This analysis will also prove useful in a more general context to some of our readers on WattClarity . 1) Specific prior peaks in Victoria Victorians won’t easily forget the scorching heat that preceded the Black Saturday bushfires of early 2009, which also meant a new all-time record Victorian demand peak of 10,496MW was set on the same day as when a yet-to-be-broken all-time maximum was set for NEM-wide demand. Last summer’s extreme demand event in Victoria was close to eclipsing that prior peak and will, likewise, be hard to forget for Victorians. Given the current holiday season, it’s not expected that the current spell of hot weather will deliver anything like those prior demand peaks – what remains to be seen is what will occur in summer 2014-15, if VIC experiences extreme weather conditions at a time when business is back at work, and schools back at school. 2) Updating long-term trends Powering up NEM-Review provides us the ability to update the insights already gleaned (above) from prior analysis. First we attached a trend of the key monthly stats for Victorian demand: This chart puts the two peaks mentioned above in the context of all other monthly peaks experienced in the Victorian region. We can also see that (perhaps minus such extremes of heat) demand peaks in the intervening four summers (09-10, 10-11, 11-12 and 12-13) were significantly below those two points, with summer 2011-12 being particularly benign. Also highlighted is the timing of the closure of Point Henry smelter, which will have an impact on all three demand measures moving forward (see these prior notes about Point Henry by one of our guest authors about how production volumes – hence electricity demand – had been declining for several years). Delving further into historical demand data in NEM-Review we generate this trended distribution chart, to highlight other interesting developments: The inclines of each of the distribution buckets shown seem to reinforce how it’s been for a variety of reasons* that demand has been declining across all hours of the day. This is seen in the declining average demand shown in both charts. * Three years ago we published this combination of factors contributing to the decline in demand . Over time the influence of various factors has changed, but the fact remains that it’s for a combination of a range of different reasons that demand patterns are changing. Somewhat (but not fully) independent from this overall pattern has been the (relatively rare) extremes in demand that occurred most significantly in summer 2008-09 and summer 2013-14. In the trended distribution chart, for instance, it’s not as easy to draw approximate “lines of best fit” through the distributions at the top end of the demand scale (i.e. coloured a shade of red or – at the extreme – purple). What this means, in essence, is that the peak demand this summer will be more difficult to predict than what the average demand would be (part of our reason to focus on this in our competition #4). 3) So far this summer Producing a Custom Chart in ez2view for the first period of summer enables us to highlight what the highest demand has been, thus far this summer (this was actually a demand of only 6,878MW on the first day of summer (dispatch demand target, same as shown in NEM-Watch at the 15:45 dispatch interval on Monday 1st December 2014): Updating today’s demand at 13:55 NEM time as the south-eastern mainland swelters , we see that it has not yet even reached 6,200MW – but is climbing rapidly (food for another post, perhaps, is the up-and-down pricing outcomes shown here): Whatever the weather holds for January, February and March, we are very confident that Victoria will see considerably higher demand periods in the weeks to follow… 4) What the AEMO forecast for VIC this summer Using the method outlined here for context-setting with NEM-Watch , we can drill into AEMO’s peak demand forecasts for this summer as published in its Electricity Statement of Opportunities during 2014 (i.e. only a few months ago). As can be understood with reference to the earlier charts of historical demand patterns above, AEMO has indicated a significant difference between the 50% POE (i.e normal weather) and the 10% POE (i.e. extreme weather) demand shape. Given current talk about this being a long, hot summer (with more bushfires like we’re seeing in Victoria today) it seems likely the actual peak demand will land at the upper end of this range . For those who really want to understand more, there is the added option of using ez2viewAustralia to compare and contrast AEMO’s MT PASA demand forecasts – which are updated once each week to focus on peak regional demand forecast. From the table shown below, I have selected the 10% POE demand forecast (i.e. what is currently expected to happen extreme temperature) and trended this. Also note that there’s not been a change in these forecasts in the past 4 weeks. Now there’s some big hints! 5) An update on today Finally, as this is being published I checked NEM-Watch again to see that the VIC region demand is now standing at 6,669MW (at 14:40) in the heat. Though it is increasing quickly, it is still almost 4,000MW below the all-time record : After considering all of the above, you can now email your forecast for peak VIC demand this summer to have your chance to win win the “Ziegler & Brown Portable Grill” from Barbeques Galore .",

    "title": "Barcaldine Solar Farm output – and the audacious 50% by 2030 renewables ambition",
    "date": "28-12-2016 01:49:00 PM",
    "content": "In amongst the pre-Christmas madness last week, we missed the opportunity to post about the advent of a new data feed for the Barcaldine Solar Farm in Queensland – the first of what will end up being a large number of solar farms across the “Sunshine State” if the current Government’s audacious “50% by 2030” transformational plan comes to fruition. 1) About the Barcaldine Solar Farm For those without a paid licence to one of our dashboard-style display products (like the full NEM-Watch or our higher-end tools) you are still able to keep an eye on the output of Barcaldine as part of the broader energy mix in the popular, RenewEconomy-sponsored NEM-Watch Fuel Type Widget , as illustrated here: Currently Barcaldine is the (first and) only Large Scale Solar plant in QLD so the total output for the state will equate to what is produced for the Barcaldine plant. However there are a number of others following on the heels of Barcaldine, so expect the total to be augmented by other projects through 2017 – where time permits, we’ll post about these on WattClarity . Out of curiosity, we also generated this trend of half-hourly data using our NEM-Review analytical tool (new version coming in 2017) – we’ve highlighted the output from Barcaldine down the bottom of the chart: Clearly the Barcaldine plant (maximum output to be 25MW) is still undergoing commissioning over the past week – we’ll expect to see its output ramp up over the coming weeks. I’ve also noted how the outputs of the three big NSW Large Scale solar plant appear to be slightly staggered most days – which I presume is due to their location (east-to-west). Perhaps one of our more informed readers can confirm this for us? 2) About the current QLD Government’s audacious* 50% ambition The current Queensland Government has announced an ambition to have 50% of electricity supplies coming from new renewable sources by 2030 – and in 2016 established the Queensland Renewable Energy Panel to consider how to achieve this . According to that website a final report was provided to the Government for some light Christmas reading, so we hope to hear more about that in early 2017. * my dictionary has the definition of audacious as “showing a willingness to take surprisingly bold risks” and, in my mind, the current QLD 50% ambition is surely that. That is not so say that it could not be achieved – however a key point is the word “risk”. It’s clear that there are risks involved (technical, political, commercial and otherwise), just as there are risks in not having such a plan (to do with climate change, ageing infrastructure, etc…). Currently it seems that there has been too little emphasis placed on how these risks can be effectively managed. Now with the current vexed political climate (with a sizeable group of people at either end of the Emotion-o-meter , shouting at each other and drowning out more rational discourse) I can understand why the hesitation by openly considering the risks inherent in the transition. However surely to not do so and adopt a “she’ll be right, mate!” approach is just to make matters worse? As shown in the snapshot of this morning’s energy mix in Queensland above, it’s a huge share of black (coal) and red (gas) that always makes up the lions share of the energy supply in Queensland. That’s not to diminish the substantial contribution coming from small scale solar (including my own 5kW rooftop power station at home ) during sunny daytimes. We should not be under any illusions about the challenges involved in getting there. A number of submissions to the draft report flagged some of these challenges – and I noted the “more work required” score given to the Draft Report by David Leitch on RenewEconomy here . David noted that: “The report is successful politically in that the key conclusions are that prices won’t increase, no thermal generation has to close and system reliability isn’t compromised.” For me, this was based on a rather “courageous” assumption that existing thermal plant would all stick around, despite having volumes collectively cut in half, to put a lid on prices and keep the system secure. (a) This (i.e. that loss-making plant will choose to stay) seems to fly in the face of recent history: i. in the Queensland region (such as with the mothballing of Tarong units, and now Swanbank E, in response to oversupply); ii. more broadly across the NEM(with closure of Redbank , Wallerawang , Anglesea, Northern and other pre-existing thermal plant, including the looming closure of the big-ticket and much-hated Hazelwood plant ); and iii. in what’s happening internationally in many markets suffering from oversupply and an incentivised influx of lower-emissions plant. (b) Now the QLD government does have another ace up its sleeve – in that it does still own the bulk of the generation assets through the Government-Owned Corporations CS Energy and Stanwell. So it could presumably take the approach of instructing them to “run the assets into the ground”, but not actually close them (notwithstanding concerns of the “clapped out 2nd car” I have already spoken about ). i. Given that the privatisation boat has long since sailed for the generation assets in the Queensland government portfolio, successive (Beattie-Bligh-Newman-Palaszczuk) governments have all tacitly agreed to a reduced return from the generation assets under its control over 10 years or more. Hence, to some extent, the financial damage has already been done. ii. However Queensland Treasury has already shown its unhappiness in the past of handing over cash to prop up loss-making, government-owned generation companies. Expect plenty more of that in the years to come to 2030 if they want to shoe-horn in more supply options to an increasingly oversupplied market and not allow plant to leave… Recalling those infamous words of Peter Beattie when speaking prior to the sale of the Energex and Ergon retail arms (along the lines of “power prices won’t rise”) I do wonder if this is not another Minister setting themselves up for opprobrium – by seeming to simplistically claim that there are no trade-offs to be made in this energy transition: Across the energy sector there are a large number of people openly acknowledging the challenges inherent in balancing the three legs on the stool that is the “Energy Trilemma” – image above taken from the E.On website here . Surely, in 2017 we can have a More Mature Discussion of the challenges involved in such a transition ( not solved yet, but solvable with rational discourse and less political slogans from both ends of the Emotion-o-meter )? Will the final report of the Expert Panel contribute to this “more mature discussion” – or will it continue with the large degree of wishful thinking contained in the draft report …",

    "title": "Managing Energy Sector Disruption is Like Delivering a Joke’s Punchline… Timing is Everything",
    "date": "20-12-2016 11:36:00 AM",
    "content": "One of the most disruptive impacts on Australia’s electricity system over the past decade or so has been the rapid uptake of air conditioners – a consumer driven response to the introduction of inexpensive products from China. Proportion of Australian Households with air conditioners 1990-2014 The impact of this has been the requirement for energy networks to increase their ability to cope with peak demand… a burden they have only been too happy to comply with, with some suggesting an over-zealous response has led to ‘gold-plating’ of some networks. Many billions of dollars have been spent over the last decade, upgrading our ability to meet ever-increasing peaks. These costs have been passed through to consumers – both those who have benefited from air conditioning and those who have not. While policy makers are typically slow to react to disruptive events (e.g. air-con efficiency standards only tightened towards the end of the uptake), the fact is that the impact on the energy sector was being effected by actors one or two steps removed from the sector itself. Homeowners bought air conditioners to meet a consumer want. Air-conditioner suppliers and retailers sold units out of self interest. Neither had much incentive to think about the cost impact to the electricity network, where perhaps more appropriate network pricing structures and demand response measures might have led to lower network augmentation costs and a more equitable outcome for consumers. And so it is now with solar and storage. As chief scientist Alan Finkel noted in his preliminary report into electricity security, the “unstoppable” move toward distributed solar and storage is a consumer driven demand . Again, it is homeowners, and to an increasing extent businesses and large energy users, and the suppliers and retailers of solar and storage systems, of whom many are one or two steps removed from interests of the electricity sector , that are driving the next wave of disruption, which will continue for at least a decade to come. Policy responses are required. Not in the future, when hindsight can make a genius of any fool, but now… as a matter of urgency. Take for example capacity mechanisms. While the NEM agonises over whether it is an appropriate response to the rise of distributed and semi-scheduled generation, we have had a capacity mechanism here in WA since 2006. There is nothing controversial about them – most energy markets around the world have some form of capacity mechanism or other. But they do need to be fit-for-purpose. The WA capacity mechanism was introduced in 2006, largely in response to supply-side shortfalls a few years earlier. At this time, basing the capacity mechanism on constructing a diesel fired OCGT was probably a sensible idea. It used appropriate technology of the day and met the construction timeframes believed to be required to head off future supply shortfalls. But a decade later, besides some tinkering at the edges, the mechanism remains the same. Is it appropriate in 2016? Unlikely. Will it be appropriate in 2020 and beyond, when the “unstoppable” force of consumerism delivers an air-conditioner-like-impact from solar and storage? Almost certainly not. Decisions made now have a chance of mitigating poor efficiency outcomes being driven by consumers who don’t have appropriate incentives to do otherwise. Of course… had the explosion in air conditioning uptake occurred 15 years later, or the solar and storage disruption begun a decade or so earlier, we might have seen a gloriously unintended coincidence of complementary technologies. Instead, we have spent billions on upgrading networks to accommodate peak demand, and now ponder how to pay down all that network capacity, as the demand disappears behind the meter (solar) and the peaks flatten out (storage).

    "title": "What’s going on with Victorian electricity demand?",
    "date": "18-12-2016 12:22:00 PM",
    "content": "Today’s brief post is more of a question than a post, really. I would really appreciate your thoughts in the comments box below (or offline, if that suits you better). You see I have been watching the NEM unfold through our NEM-Watch dashboard, and other things, and have been frequently seeing Victorian demand down the dark-blue end of the sliding colour scale, even during the day – such as today: Now, for readers without their own paid licence to the full NEM-Watch application, you can have a look at similar data through the NEM-Watch Consumption Widget, which is located: 1) On the Energy Consumer’s Australia site (our sponsors with this widget); 2) Here, on the NEM-Watch portal – including an explanation of the numbers; and 3) On a number of other sites where people have chosen to embed the widget (no charge). Might be something of interest to you, as well? Just keep in mind that the full NEM-Watch product focuses on “Scheduled Demand” whereas the Consumption Widget focuses on “Operational Demand” (which is closer to total consumption). The measures are a bit different, but the message is the same – Victorian demand is very low, and has been for some time . How low, you ask? With NEM-Review I have produced the following trend (since January 2010) of daily maximum and minimum demand in Victoria. As you can see, there’s a continuing trend of reduction in minimum daily demand: We can clearly see the two big peaks in VIC demand , associated with: 1) the Black Saturday bushfire period in summer 2008-2009 – peaking over 10,400MW on 29th January 2009 . 2) the heatwave period of summer 2013-14 – peaking over 10,200MW on 16 Jan 2014 . At the other end of the scale, we see that the lowest demand period in the year is typically associated with the Christmas period – when not even the mouse is stirring, etc… Of particular note on the low side are: 1) the low, low point down below 3,300MW on 28th Sept 2014; 2) an even lower demand level on 1st May this year below 3,200MW; and 3) a consistent bunch of days in the past few months when there have been 10 days with the demand dropping below 3,300MW. In terms of the most recent lull, we know that: 1) there are problems continuing since the power troubles on 1st December led to damage at the smelter which has made a troubled commercial situation worse (the latest being today’s note of a mercy dash by politicians to Alcoa corporate HQ ). 2) Back in 2011, I posted this list of reasons why demand had been declining across the NEM . 3) We also know that, when we are talking about minimum demands, it’ can’t be as a result of solar PV – because minimum demands occur at night time (hence please leave that hobby horse alone in comments below). 4) With respect to the NEM-Watch snapshot above (which is during the day) we see how Melbourne’s weather has been very mild for a December period. I am interested in real insights you can shed about why minimum demands seem to have ratcheted lower in Victoria (moreso than in SA, NSW, TAS and QLD perhaps) in recent months? Thank-you, in advance.",

    "title": "Forecasting is a Mug’s Game",
    "date": "16-12-2016 08:02:00 AM",
    "content": "It should be obvious (but is most often forgotten in the “excitement” that surrounds the release of key forecasts, like AEMO’s NTNDP , or the AEMC’s Pricing Forecast ) that looking forward into the future is a mugs game ( as previously noted ). It is, however, something we need to make a fist of, to make any sense of answering key questions about what we should be doing now to make the future better. Unfortunately there are three main flaws in the forecasting process: Flaw #1: A Model’s just a Model – it’s not reality I’ve noted this before, a number of times , but it is worth stressing here. There is no model that exists (or even could exist) that can accurately represent all of the intertwined technical and commercial intricacies of the National Electricity Market. It is worth noting that there are those who might disagree with me, like Dean over at Reposit , who links to this article at HBR : My own take is that models will certainly get better , but they will never be perfect. A key question, then, is what is the level of “good enough”? Some of the current shortcomings in the models that exist today include: 1a) The good models currently model the fully interconnected transmission grid across the NEM, taking into account all (or almost all) “System Normal” constraint sets. However it is not possible to fully accurately model the effect of the transient constraints (e.g. such as the transmission outage that led to load shedding on 1st December ), as (by definition) they cannot be known in advance. Unfortunately, because of the nature of pricing in the NEM (and especially how this is changing ) it is these outliers that will have a hugely disproportionate effect on price outcomes across the year. 1b) As noted here , the NEM is a Market – and, as such, people in a market respond (on both the supply side, and the demand side). I’ve noted this before , including how we want this to happen – indeed, we need it to happen, for the market to deliver efficient outcomes. It does mean that we can guess at – but not know – how “the market” might respond to what’s actually happened, and expectations of what might happen in future. 1c) The NEM is also not an island. As others have noted, it’s impacted by other external factors – some of them market-based (like the RET , a market in and of itself) and some of them more policy-driven (or should I say “politics-driven”, like the broader response to the climate challenge). In my experience, some models are better at the physical side than the commercial/economic side, whilst other models are the better on the economics than the engineering. All need to make simplifications. All have their uses – but you’d better be sure you know of their strengths and weaknesses. Takeaway #1 – Unless you understand the key simplifications made in that particular model (they all have them, but they will be different), and understand the significance of them, then you are very likely to be deluded by the results in some way. Flaw #2: Garbage In = Garbage Out We’ve all heard this one before, I would hope. At the very least, the industry has (collectively) improved a long way from 20 years ago, when forecasts were released with great fanfare but analysis of the underlying assumptions might not even have been buried in an appendix. It’s why, for instance, we invested the time way back in 2008 to do this sort of analysis of successive demand growth forecasts – which just happened to be (coincidence) around the time that demand growth began to flatten off, and then decline . However the macro demand numbers (energy and peak) are but a few of the great many input assumptions made in any model. Giles has included his own critique of one particular modelling exercise here (and a particular comment by David Pethick below that article is also worth particular attention). Back 20 years ago, models had to deal with variability of demand, and randomised forced outage patterns of thermal generators. Both difficult, but do-able to some extent. To that mix we now have to add in a number of other independently variable factors that are different to model over a longer time horizon: 2a) variability of energy stored in hydro storages (as everyone was blindsided about with the 2007 drought). 2b) variability and diversity of wind harvest patterns from wind farms – one reason I have been intrigued by the surprising lack of diversity across the current stock of wind farms in the south-western part of the NEM. With wind, we only have 5-10 years of history, so not enough to form a complete picture of any longer-term performance challenges that the turbines might encounter (and which should be taken into account in long-term modelling) 2c) variability and diversity of solar production patterns from small-scale solar PV, and also the few large-scale plant currently existing. Take, for instance, the fact that the storm that blanketed South Australia on September 28th and led to the state-wide blackout also had the effect of covering pretty much the entire state and so severely curtailing solar production, as seen in this chart from NEM-Review : Now let me be very clear here, for the emotional finger-pointers at both ends of the Emotion-o-Meter : i) my point here has nothing to do with the blackout . ii) my point is that we have a real case, here, where a state-wide storm has temporarily dropped the entire solar production for the state by 80-90% over a period lasting several hours. These types of incidents (e.g. the frequency and duration) will need to be taken into account in modelling as the NEM transitions to one heavily dependent on solar production. This task will be made harder by the opacity of solar PV . 2d) in the near future modellers will also need to incorporate input assumptions about battery storage (both large scale and distributed) – particularly in terms of: i. How much will be deployed – where, and when; and then ii. How it will be operated – by whom, and what their commercial drivers are (e.g. tariff arbitrage, or spot market trading, or other); and [more on this one in 2017] 2e) there are others, as well… Suffice to say that more attention should be focused on the input assumptions made by the modeller in running a model. Some might see that as an exercise in “disproving” the results of a given model – I view it as a more general process of saying “given that you assumed X, and the Model produced Y, what can we learn about what might really happen” Takeaway #2 – We need to invest more time to understand the input assumptions made in the modelling. Flaw #3: Consultants are only human – they (like all of us) talk their own book I’ve also notice a trend for people to adopt their favourite forecaster, and to bag their “least favourite” ones – a trend which seems to be based on the degree to which the outputs from the modelling exercise align with the recipients own preconceived notions of what the outcome should be. It’s part of the bigger game that’s called “Consultants at 20 Paces” which I spoke about in 2014 here . Here’s a recent case: As I noted in response, everyone is talking their book – referencing the comments I had made previously here . The sooner we all accept that (including the fact that we are no different ourselves ) the sooner we can progress to a place better equipped to deal with the insights a particular consultant might be providing. Takeaway #3 – Learn how each individual forecaster might be biased in order to factor this into the results they provide, and (they all have them, but they will be different), and understand the significance of them, then you are very likely to be deluded by the results in some way. In summary, software’s not perfect (flaw #1), nor are humans (flaw #3) and data can lie (flaw #2). With this in mind, I hope we can (collectively) approach the modelling that will need to be done in future with more of an open mind… [Oh, and next time someone tells you that some particular model “proves” a particular outcome (which just might align with their tightly held beliefs), feel free to reply that Forecasting is a Mug’s Game , and direct them to this post]",

    "date": "15-12-2016 10:44:00 AM",
    "content": "Well, well – where’s Sir Joh when you need him? Whilst busy working on other developments to keep our many and varied paying customers happy, one of our canny WattClarity readers alerted me to this Market Notice from yesterday evening talking about likely industrial action at Loy Yang A power station – taken from NEM-Watch : Talk about pouring oil onto a blazing fire… No sooner have the COAG Energy Ministers disbanded from their chinwag (and photo opp) session yesterday will they be considering re-convening to address the latest emerging risk to security of supply (one I noted here as a potential game changer ). Here’s one view of AEMO’s MT PASA forecast for the next 12 months showing aggregated generation capacity scheduled to be made available in the Victorian region of the NEM: For those not familiar, scheduled generators have to indicate to the AEMO how much capacity they are planning to make available to the market (at any price) each day for the next 2 years. The AEMO stacks these up and updates every 3 hours. In the ez2view chart above, we highlight the current run (from 09:00 today) and compare this with the one from 18:00 yesterday (i.e. prior to the announcement). What the AEMO does then is compare this available capacity with what they expect the demand might be to produce a daily figure for Surplus Capacity (with the general idea being the higher the surplus the more secure the supply, and also the lower the price). It’s obviously dependent on what the demand actually turns out to be, but gives a useful guide as to the relative risks on each day over the period. Here’s a view (again from ez2view , this time in Forecast Convergence) of how this forecast of Surplus Capacity from MT PASA has changed over the past 2 years – each row a separate weekly forecast. I’ve highlighted the step change following the Hazelwood closure announcement, however it does not yet* reflect the effect of the Industrial Action at Loy Yang A : * the effect of the industrial action is not yet shown as these forecasts are only updated once each week (on Tuesdays) – hence we’ll have to have a look next week for an update. Now it must be said that the Christmas period will be one of lower demand, and that Hazelwood is still running for another few months – hence the risk of “lights going out” is low if the industrial action is of short duration . However one does still wonder – with Brown Coal generation businesses facing terminal decline, how does such an audacious plan actually represent the interests of the workers at the plant ? Are they smoking the stuff down there, rather than burning it in the boilers? I’m pretty sure the soon-to-be-redundant workers at the neighbouring Hazelwood plant would be all too happy to swap jobs with those workers at Loy Yang A who evidently want a longer Christmas holiday (in fact, perhaps that is part of the plan the unions have in mind in a “young for old” swap). One might wonder if the Unions have a suicide mission in mind? Another example of unions playing Russian Roulette with our electricity supplies (i.e. following the risk of action at Longford, since averted)? This is a situation far too familiar for those with long memories of the SEQEB workers dispute of the 1980’s – and we all know how that ended… I can already hear the responses from those on the green/left of the energy debate, using this as an argument for the risks inherent in large, centralised (and heavily unionised) production facilities , which in this case just happen to burn dirty brown coal . The moves by this unionised workforce will only work to hasten the demise of Loy Yang A – and where does that leave the employees (and union members)? Redundant, but perhaps with a bigger redundancy payout by virtue of these high-stakes moves . PS – another astute WattClarity reader has posed the question of what this means for next door Loy Yang B, given that the same mine (which will be affected by the industrial action) supplies both, and from a common bunker, I believe. Does it mean that a mine stoppage will take out both? What game are these union heavies playing, one does wonder… PPS at 14:25 – it gets much worse . See below the latest run showing the effect of the capacity of Loy Yang A being out for the whole of 2017. No apparent mention of Loy Yang B, though… (though I do see it in this article on the AFR ) PPPS at 15:41 – if that was worse, than this is dire . See below a more updated run, which shows another 980MW of capacity coming out from 28th December through until 17th March . This suggests perhaps Loy Yang B, as well? I also note that this article in the Age today is growing in length, and now notes that: “The Andrews government quickly responded on Thursday, stepping in to terminate the actions from both sides due to the risk of significant damage they posed to the economy. Industrial Relations Minister Natalie Hutchins launched the application to the Fair Work Commission. ‘This will force both parties to get back to the table to end this dispute and the Fair Work Commission is the appropriate place for this to occur,’ she said. The government’s request could cause the tribunal to intervene and force the long-running dispute to be settled without negotiation.” PPPPS at 16:30 – strike has been called off ? According to ABC news, the strike has been called off: One does wonder – what has been achieved, for the CFMEU, other than to stick a big target on its back (and the back of Bill Shorten, by association) with respect to Industrial Relations reform… Several days elapsed, during which time comments were added below. PS on Wednesday 21st December – ETU calls for strike now According to articles in the Age yesterday ( here and here ) the ETU is now calling for a strike on Christmas Day.",

It’s Friday we’re more interested in. Given our keen interest in the the electricity sector (and particularly a keen interest in what peak summer demand will be over many prior summers *) I had a quick look at one of the older views of AEMO forecast data within the ez2view energy sector browser, and see the AEMO forecasting demand to peak above 9,000MW this Friday, even in just the 50% POE case : The level forecast here for Friday would be up very close to the new all-time record maximum set on Monday 1st February 2016 as noted the day after . Obviously what the actual demand ends up being will be a result of a number of semi-independent factors, including: (a) How high the temperature (and humidity) reaches, and whether there is a storm change that day; (b) Cloud cover, and the impact this will have on the large amount of solar PV in the state – particularly in the south-east corner, including my own little power station (though solar will be rapidly declining that late in the day); and (c) Any instances of price-induced demand response in the region (it’s fair to assume that prices might be bouncing around a bit on the day).

The market ancillary service provider is required to satisfy certain registration requirements and deliver FCAS services in accordance with AEMO’s specifications just as any other market participant currently is required to do.

In the past, I have wondered (on hearing such high numbers) how these sentiments have translated into action for both residential and business customers. Hence today I accessed the most recent of these GreenPower Quarterly Reports (Q4 December 2015, so there seems to be a fair lag) to check out the statistics provided herein: There does seem to be a big disconnect, that I don’t understand – if 83% of people surveyed in NSW want more renewable energy generated, then why is it that a much lower percentage (less than 5%, with an assumption of many more than 1,000,000 residential customers in NSW) seem to actually pay for it themselves, directly? I understand that some customers won’t be aware of the availability of the GreenPower program, as a means through which they can (today) put their preferences into action. But gut feeling suggests there would be other factors involved… I assume that someone else has already worked this through, to explain the reason(s) for the difference.

    "date": "02-11-2016 12:16:00 PM",
    "content": "Given the ongoing speculation (in places like this article in the Age today , and hence bouncing around on social media), we’ve fielded a few calls from journalists and others for our insights into what is likely to happen to electricity prices in Victoria, and further afield, if a closure occurs. In parallel, I have noted a number of commentators providing their own perspectives on what’s likely to happen – ranging across the full spectrum of the Emotion-o-Meter , from: (a) She’ll all be hunky-dory; to (b) The sky will fall in. Rather than repeat my perspective in further one-on-one calls, I thought it more efficient to refer to my prior comments in September , and add this brief post…. 1) Let’s start with reality Firstly, let’s get the obvious out of the way (at least, it should be obvious, but does not seem to be): No-one can know what the price impacts will be . Anyone telling you anything else is simply selling you something ( perhaps talking their own book? ) 2) Here’s three big reasons why it’s not possible to know As I’ve noted on WattClarity before, the NEM is a complex place . It is because of these complexities that it is impossible to know what the price impacts will be. Here are three big ones (and that’s not a comprehensive list ): 2a) The east-coast network is beset by numerous transmission constraints This is our starting point, as an industry – and it’s something that’s likely to become more complex in the future if more remote-site low-emissions generation sources connect to the grid. Given we have invested $Millions in the development of ez2view as the ‘top-shelf’ means for understanding how the network operates, and impacts on pricing and dispatch outcomes in the market in real time, we understand a little about this subject. Yes, that’s us talking our book: 1. It’s complex 2. “Models” that just stack up available capacity for the NEM and compare against demand (or even at a region level), without taking both “System Normal” and the more transient constraints into account in forecasting what outcomes might be are woefully inadequate , or just downright misleading . In their cases, those models are a long way from reality . Here’s three cases in recent history where the transmission network had a major bearing on price outcomes in the NEM: 1. The problems in Tasmania through the early part of 2016. 2. The price escalation seen in South Australia in July 2016 – which itself followed on from some other emerging pricing patterns . 3. The (very) unfortunate blackout in South Australia of 28th September , where transmission issues played a key (but not a solo) role. There are many, many more that fly under the radar of the broader group of energy sector stakeholders, but which still have an impact on pricing and dispatch patterns (practically) each and every day. 2b) Participants will (quite naturally) change their behaviour It’s a market, right. Participants changing their behaviour in response to changing market conditions is a natural part of a well functioning market. It’s what we want them to do – as this helps to deliver the lowest cost, most sustainable outcome over the long-term. AGL’s not going to know how Engie will change its bidding behaviour and contracting strategy for Loy Yang B as a result of the closure of Hazelwood – and how this will flow through to Origin, etc…. What hope does an independent commentator have? Zip. 2c) Developments that might follow on… Back in September, I flagged the possibility that other flow on developments would also combined to impact on prices (citing Portland smelter, and industrial unrest at Loy Yang A as 2 examples). There are plenty more. It’s possible (though not certain ), for instance, that higher spot prices in VIC and elsewhere would provide more impetus to the acceleration of the sluggish development of renewables projects stacked up but waiting for developers to pull the trigger. … but this would then have more of an impact on the viability of remaining thermal plant, … and so the cycle would continue. In summary, the next time you read an article somewhere else purporting to tell you that the prices will go sky high, stay the same, drop (or even “won’t affect power prices as much as you might think” – whatever the hell that actually means? ) then it might pay to reflect on the fact that: 1. The commentator cannot know ; and 2. Hence it might pay to wonder how/why they are “talking their book” . Wouldn’t it be smarter if we, as an industry, collectively accepted that the future is unknowable – hence stop making unrealistic promises to the broader community, who will surely hold us to account? Again. That’s all I have time for today.",

As a result, a new energy ecosystem is emerging. Accenture has recently released three reports which cover different aspects of this new ecosystem. These are the ‘New Energy Consumer’ report, ‘Digitally Enabled Grid’ report and the combined report for the ENA and CSIRO titled ‘Insights from Global Jurisdictions and Evolving Business Models’. As a summary, these reports show the new energy ecosystem and how it can be explained by three seismic shifts, four consumer trends and three broad transformations that the Australian industry should take strong interest in. Just remember three-four-three. Three seismic shifts Infinite disruption, asymmetric competition and ‘regulatory reimagined’ make up our three seismic shifts. Conceptually, disruption is infinite because it never stops, you can’t outflank it and more often than not, you can’t see it coming. There is disruption to demand because it is static or declining around the world (even where peak demand is not). This is leading to a huge decoupling of revenue from consumption, for example Mojo selling energy at wholesale rates and charging a subscription. Then there is disruption from technologies. Platforms are popping up everywhere. The Internet of Things and intelligent automation are hot topics. Blockchain (a technology that was anticipated to make waves in the financial sector) is now becoming a disruptive force in the energy space. An example is New York-based Transactive Grid which is a community energy market enabled by blockchain. Transactive Grid enables the buying and selling of electrons using a transaction database that is replicated and synchronised across multiple locations. Similarly, artificial intelligence (AI) is also making waves in the energy sector. Flipper is a UK-based AI platform that learns consumer habits and finds the cheapest utilities according to personal needs. Asymmetric competition means that new players emerging overnight, from both within the energy industry, as well as other industries. Powerpeers for example, is a new business in the Netherlands owned by energy provider Vattenfall. Referred to as the ‘Air BnB’ of energy, it enables consumers and prosumers to contract directly with one another, providing a localised exchange of energy and enabling full energy traceability. Similarly in Australia, Telstra has even started its own energy division. Though Telstra is a telecommunications provider, it is leveraging its capabilities to enter the electricity market with a bundled value proposition. The ‘reimagining of regulation’ is happening across the world. One of the most prominent examples is New York’s ‘Reforming the Energy Vision’ (REV) program. They are overhauling the entire system with changes in current regulatory, tariff and market designs and incentive structures. The trend is towards market-based reform but the trick is how to get them functioning correctly when the basic provision of electricity is an essential service and must be achieved leaving little room for market based fluctuations. Four consumer trends Combine these disruptions with the transformational attitudes of today’s digital consumers and you can understand the challenge facing energy providers in this rapidly evolving market. As discovered in Accenture’s recent New Energy Consumer study, millennials will be the largest energy consuming cohort by 2020, and will shape the way utilities of the future deliver their products. According to the New Energy Consumer study, 75 per cent of Australian millennials are likely to consider switching to a different energy provider if their energy provider is not able to provide a seamless experience. Millennials are characterised by four consumer trends: Instant everything – they want services that are fast, simple and effortless. There is no such thing as delayed gratification anymore, as evidenced by the likes of PayPal and Amazon Prime. They now expect similar speed and gratification from all organisations they interact with. Hyper-relevant experiences – Millennials want everything to be highly customised and relevant. They want personalised interactions and experiences that align with their lifestyle. Meaningful experiences – Purchasing energy is now a meaningful experience – it’s an expression of ‘who I am’ and this is shared with everyone. Purchasing energy demonstrates passion and environmental and social value, which is a trend pointing to the need for intangible branding, which goes far beyond product value. Collective consumption – Finally, millennials want to share and be part of a community, they are less interested in owning things. This trends is what community based peer-to-peer energy trading models are tapping into. Customer strategies must take a broad view of the trends shaping today’s consumers, and more importantly, the consumers of tomorrow. Millennials are the most important cohort, must be taken seriously and business models need to adapt to meet their needs. Three transformations moving forward Seismic shifts and consumer trends are changing business models most importantly in the retail and network operator industry. As such, we see three emerging retail plays. Energy providers can look to become a commodity centric supplier, an energy marketplace enabler (that links all of the best new technologies together and provides personalised services) or a connected lifestyle provider (which provides peer to peer energy models.) From a grid perspective we see the Distribution Platform Optimiser model dominating all outcomes. This means that the role of network operators will evolve towards one which not only integrates and connects DERs but optimises DER capacity in a time and location manner to provide the optimal outcome for the overall system. If done well the grid can be optimised by the strategic use of distributed generation – helping to balance demand and supply and defer costly capital upgrades. This model would also require a new role – a ‘Distribution System Operator’ which would manage and coordinate interactions between the distribution and the wholesale market. The ultimate outcome of this would be that thousands of battery storage, solar, community wind and CHP units would be incentivised and optimised for grid stability – aligning DG owners and the grids’ interests while at the same time lessening volatility on the wholesale market. In our recent ENA and CSIRO study we looked at 7 of the more interesting global jurisdictions. We studied their drivers for change, market and infrastructure capabilities and their ambitions as described by their major reform programs. What struck us was the ambition of some of these areas. New York especially but also California and the Netherlands all have sophisticated highly ambitious transformation programs. From an Australian perspective, we see it as inevitable that we will take a similar approach and consolidate many of our incremental reforms into a larger transformation program with a longer term vision. Perhaps this will be an Oz REV – An Australian ‘Reforming the Energy Vision’ program Finally, for Australian energy providers to be successful it’s important to have a coherent understanding of the industry’s changing dynamics and a sense of global perspective and master the three-four-three.

    "title": "About the looming (potential) closure of Hazelwood power station",
    "date": "26-09-2016 08:23:00 AM",
    "content": "I’ve been away for a while on a short break for the school holidays and returned to the growing murmurs about the potential closure of the Hazelwood Power Station in – both in the regular media (such as Saturday’s article in the Age and this article today in the AFR ) and plenty of views, already, in social media. (A) Looking backwards Charging up NEM-Review again, I produced this trend of monthly aggregate production and approximate spot revenues for the station since the beginning of the NEM: As can be seen, production volumes have been declining since the peak in October 2011. This will be one of the historical factors weighing on the minds of the shareholders (Engie and Mitsui) in relation to the future of the station. A1) Average monthly spot revenue Taking the monthly aggregate data for the station we produced this trend of monthly average spot revenue for the station: As noted on the chart, Hazelwood station had been enjoying higher average spot revenue in recent months – higher than most other periods in the 18 years since the initiation of the NEM! However (as noted) these average revenues were on reduced volumes over the period. The first chart above shows that Hazelwood aggregate spot revenues also appear to have been reasonably healthy (despite the lower production volumes). … which might lead readers to surmise that a closure decision (if it eventuates) is more to do with a view of what’s coming down the path in the future, rather than recent results. A2) Comparison with Wind and Solar Given the ongoing energy-sector transitional journey we’ve all embarked on, it’s natural that many will want to draw comparisons between the size of Hazelwood and the aggregate amount of ‘new renewables’ that would need to be constructed in order to replace the ageing dinosaur that is Hazelwood. However readers should be very aware that such simple “swap this with that” mental exercises can be overly simplistic – and potentially dangerously so, if the level of thinking does not progress further than these initial comparisons. A2a) Most Simplistic Most people start at nameplate capacity of various supply options – and this is entirely understandable as an entry point . For instance, with 8 x 220MW units (nameplate), the station maximum potential output is of the order of 1,760MW. At first brush, many treat all MW as equal and hence infer that Hazelwood might be replaced with 8 wind farms of approximately the same size as Ararat Wind Farm, which recently began operations (full size 240MW when completed so 10% larger than a Hazelwood unit based on nameplate). A2b) Somewhat less simplistic, but still not enough Understanding the innate intermittency of wind and solar (the only 2 renewables options being deployed at scale as new generation sources in the NEM), most people progress to a more mature comparison of MWh production. This is a better approach. For this reason, we have included in the first chart above both: (i) Trended aggregate output from small-scale solar PV in Victoria; and See notes here about the difficulties in “measuring” aggregate output from rooftop PV in a particular area – like the state of Victoria. Note also that there are no large scale plants in the state currently, and notably none in the list of 12 to gain funding from ARENA . Hence no signs that VIC will see other than lots of small-scale PV for some years to come. (ii) Trended aggregate output from all wind farms across Victoria (including Ararat and 9 others, one of which is significantly larger than Ararat). As a somewhat-useful rule-of-thumb, readers can eyeball the chart above and make some observations about “how many times” new wind or rooftop solar PV capacity would need to be added to Victoria in order to replace the Hazelwood output. (i) Between 2 and 3 times the total number of wind farms currently producing (noting that there are 10 of them); or (ii) Perhaps 10 times the number of solar panels deployed across the state currently. Even this, however, is not enough… A2c) A better (more nuanced) understanding To be truly useful, a comparison will need to take into account the different nuances (such as locationality and temporal value) that is inherent in keeping the lights on 24x7x365 across all pockets of the NEM. These nuances are reflected at both macro and micro level in various ways, including: (i) At a grid-wide (and market-wide) level, many informed stakeholders – such as AEMO and BNEF – are noting how this transition is producing increasing complexity, and challenge , which remains to be solved. (ii) In the escalating “wind correlation penalty” that wind-heavy portfolios would suffer if a simple MWh-for-MWh swap were to be carried ( I’ve posted these comments earlier about how this is already being suffered by portfolios like Infigen in South Australia). Such a penalty – and especially the fact that it will accelerate in severity with increasing (all else being equal) will increasingly call the long-term viability of an energy-only, gross pool market design into question (albeit that other options such as capacity payments have many warts ). I do hope to see commentary flowing from the mooted closure quickly progressing from the simplistic to the more useful. (B) Looking forwards Looking backwards can only take us so far, however. A more important (though far more difficult) consideration is about what is unfolding in front of us. B1) Diversity of opinions As frequent readers of WattClarity® will be aware, I did have some involvement with one of the consulting firms that specialises in energy market modelling – which helped to reinforce my view that every model’s just a model (they’re poor reflections of the technical, commercial, political and psychological complexities inherent in reality – though in some cases might be useful). Hence we’re not going to allow ourselves to get distracted by claims (expressed with certainty by various commentators) that certain things are “certain” to happen as a result of a Hazelwood closure. I would make one exception, however – I would put money on the chance that, in the coming weeks (stretching into months, if the closure decision is actually made at the Board Meeting, as mooted) we will see an increased volume of frenzied commentary from people sitting at both extremes of the “Emotion-o-Meter”. B2) What’s the data already showing Beyond models, and more simple conjecture, the market already provides several sources of data that some might take to be a hint in terms of what might happen following the closure of Hazelwood during 2017. B2a) In the physical market? The AEMO, through its MT PASA process, receives and aggregates all (major) generator’s forecasts of the availability of their capacity out 2 years into the future – and then aggregates this to produce a view of the aggregate supply capacity in each region. Using our ez2view software , we have provided this comparison of the aggregate supply capacity declared to be available in Victoria over the coming 12 months – with a “delta” shown to the aggregate capacity as generators had collectively declared to the AEMO a couple of days prior (i.e. 10 updates beforehand). Certainly a drop of 1,760MW in capacity available (which would result from the closure of Hazelwood) would be noticeable here – but none is. If and when a decision is made, Engie will be bound (by the market rules) to alert AEMO (and hence the market) through the PASA process. B2b) In the financial market? What is “the market” collectively thinking of this possibility? Glancing into the financial market using the ez2trend framework we have under development, we see that futures prices for Victoria have been escalating for the three following Q2 periods: If the closure was to take effect from 1st April 2017 (as mooted in the article in The Age), the first quarter directly affected would be Q2 2017. Hence the BaseLoad price has been trended for that quarter. It’s important to note that: (i) The escalation of prices shown here for Q2 2017 (and for Q2 2018 and Q2 2019) obviously pre-dates any announcement by Engie confirming a closure – and pre-dates this weekend’s article in the Age. Hence other factors are also at work. (ii) Also shown is how the Q2 2016 price jumped sharply in the quarter, as a result of what were some remarkable prices seen across all regions over that quarter . We cannot know, for sure, but we can presume that the effects in the physical market flowed through to trader’s expectations for prices in subsequent years. B3) Several factors we’ll watch out for Moving forwards, there are a number of other Victorian-centric developments we’ll keep an eye on in order to give consideration to the potential impacts of a Hazelwood closure. B3a) Next moves, for the Portland Aluminium Smelter? One of these is the (mooted) looming decision that Alcoa may still need to make with respect to the ongoing future of the large Portland aluminium smelter – triggered by the end of the long-dated, low-priced hedge that was agreed by the SECV with Alcoa many years ago. We’ve already experienced the closure of the Point Henry smelter (and Kurri Kurri in NSW) – but Portland is significantly larger, and would make a bigger dent in the supply/demand balance. Closure of Portland would have some effect in partially balancing out the effect of the withdrawal of the large energy supplies produced historically by Hazelwood. B3b) The unfolding dramas with the EBA at Loy Yang A? Over the weekend there were more news articles (such as this article from Sunday in the Age ) about the ongoing dramas at neighbouring and larger Loy Yang A power station. If Hazelwood were to close, it certainly would place far more significance on the outcomes of these negotiations – and any industrial action that might be conducted in the lead-up to a formal resolution. If the coal sector is in terminal decline, then some might view union demands such as this (reportedly rejecting a 20% pay rise over 4 years in the hopes of something more) as dancing the sector into an earlier grave. Difficult to understand how this is helping members to a sustainable future? Or perhaps part of the union objective is with an eye to the future redundancy payments (a multiple of final salary) or early retirement (for the lucky workers on legacy on defined benefits scheme, hence with payout also being a multiple of final pay)? As time permits, we’ll try to publish further thoughts about what unfolds with respect to a potential closure of Hazelwood here on WattClarity®.",

    "title": "Infigen Energy suffering from “wind correlation penalty” in South Australian wind farms",
    "date": "01-09-2016 08:41:00 AM",
    "content": "Tuesday’s AFR contained an article titled “Infigen back in the black, buries talk of merger” ( online here under a slightly different name ) which made for interesting reading – particularly the part that reads: “Profit from continuing operators was $7 million, up from a loss of $18.4 million in 2014-15, which Mr George said was mostly due to higher prices for electricity and for large-scale renewable energy certificates (LGCs). He pointed to much higher forward wholesale prices in South Australia and NSW for 2016-17, which would benefit Infigen’s plants that operate on the merchant market rather than being tied into a power sales contract. Futures prices in South Australia, where the market is more reliant on renewables and gas power since the closure of the last coal fired station, stand at $110 a megawatt hour for 2016-17, up 78 per cent from last year. With prices also higher for LGCs, …” The comment (which I have highlighted) linking higher forward prices to future good times for Infigen started me thinking … Avid readers of WattClarity ® will understand that I’ve posted a number of times in the past about the high degree of correlation (i.e. lack of diversity) across all wind farms currently operating in the NEM (right across NSW, VIC, SA and TAS) and the challenges this represents for organisations like the AEMO over various time horizons . The question occurred to me: To what extent does a high forward price in South Australia actually flow through to underlying share market value for a spot-market exposed, very wind-focused company like Infigen? or, to put it another way, To what extend does the apparent “wind correlation penalty” erode value that will be accruing to other spot-exposed generators (i.e. gas-fired ones*) in South Australia? I invested a couple hours on Wednesday to investigate, before posting today. Back on 4th July, I posted this analysis of some remarkable pricing patterns observed across all regions of the NEM through Q2 2016 – and followed up with this initial list of some of the contributing factors . It is understandable that, viewing South Australia with a “rising tide floats all boats” mindset would lead one to conclude that this would be beneficial for all remaining generators in the state. However, having been buried in the data on other occasions in the past, I understand that it’s often the case that simple conclusions end up being overly simplistic. I’ve posted this today to sum up my thinking, thus far, and pose the question – what are the significant things that I am missing? I powered up NEM-Review and selected 3 groups of power stations very much the focus for this particular piece of analysis: (a) Torrens A and Torrens B – the gas-fired plant operated by “big bad AGL”, who stand accused of price gouging in SA and other nasties (though not, notably, by Rod Sims at the ACCC ) (b) Northern – formerly operated by Alinta until it closed through Q2 as a result of a poor outlook, and (I understand) increasing difficulty accessing coal (c) Lake Bonney 2 and 3 stations – two of the spot-exposed wind farms operated by Infigen in the South Australian region. Using NEM-Review directly to produce trends of monthly station production, and also monthly estimated spot revenue, we then extracted the data to Excel to generate this trend of monthly average spot revenue for the stations for all months since January 2000: We can see in this chart how volatile monthly average spot revenue has been for all 5 of the stations (but particularly Torrens A), which is one of the reasons why generators of all types typically like to hedge forward some percentage of their revenue, in order to provide more evening out of cash flows. At the moment, however, the 2 x Infigen Wind farms are apparently unhedged – which means some upside potential, but also some risk. Zooming in to the bottom $200/MWh price range, we get a clearer view of the “wind correlation penalty” that Infigen (and all other wind farm operators in South Australia) are paying by virtue of the high degree of correlation of their outputs – particularly during overnight periods, where their collective bidding at below zero has sometimes driven the spot price below zero for periods (i.e. they, along with all other generations, have had to pay AEMO to keep running at that time): This chart’s a fair bit noisier than is the first chart above – but a clear gap can be seen between the two green lines (for Lake Bonney) and the orange and red lines (for Torrens). Interestingly, we also see that Northern suffered the same type of penalty (compared to the Torrens plants) for many of the months that it was operational. Especially on the volatile months , AGL has been able to use the dispatchability of the Torrens plant to earn much higher average revenues than Infigen with its wind-dependent Lake Bonney plant (i.e. wind farms have collectively shot themselves in the foot). News that the Hornsdale Wind Farm (now contracted for all 3 stages, I believe) is being constructed as well is also not good news in terms of Infigen’s expected spot revenues, moving forwards. We’re presuming that Hornsdale will have a similar production profile, in a crowded region – which will compound the revenue gap (though we note that Hornsdale will be somewhat insured against this by virtue of the PPA structure in place with the ACT Government). To make this clearer, I’ve generated the following chart that presents two sets of data: 1) In trend line, I’ve compared the average spot revenue for Torrens (A+B) with average spot revenue for Lake Bonney (2+3) – also including the average spot price for the region (in black) between the red and the green. 2) In trended grey bars, I have plotted the monthly ratio of Lake Bonney (2+3) average spot against average spot price (i.e. with a ratio below 1 highlighting how average spot revenue at Lake Bonney is lower than the “all hours” average spot price). Unfortunately, to the naked eye it seems to align with what I had been suspecting – the “wind correlation penalty” is getting worse . This penalty is effectively paid by Infigen (in revenue forfeited) because their output is highly correlated with that of other wind farms across South Australia. All these wind farms, operating in tandem, are driving collective returns lower because they are all operating at the same time, and incapable of running when the wind’s not blowing (without major investment in storage, for instance). What this seems to mean is that, even if the base-load futures prices for South Australia are increasing on the ASX, Infigen may be at risk of increasingly missing out on the full share of the benefits as the wind farms have been effectively creating their own sub-market in South Australia increasingly divorced from the 24x7x365 nature of flat contract prices across the year. Finally, with respect to traded prices for futures contracts on the ASX – we take present this view (using a BETA of ez2trend ) of how the increased volatility seen in SA prices beginning Q2 (and then flowing into an explosive July 2016 period) have flowed through into elevated base load contract prices for future years (i.e. partly because trader sentiment is a funny thing). This was the source of the hope expressed by Infigen in the quotes attributed to them in the AFR article – however I’m not sure that the benefits will transfer. Indeed, as shown here, the separation between “Wind Average Spot Revenue” and “Average Spot Price – All Hours” has widened in recent months . Am I missing something here? Is this something that Infigen stockholders might want to be aware of? Notes with respect to the above: Footnote #1) LGC market benefits seem to be less ambiguous for Infigen The AFR article goes on to talk about a higher price for LGCs. To the extent that Infigen’s LGC production is not already contracted forward, then this would seem (to me) to be much more tightly correlated to increased revenue for the company (and hence presumably profit, given low cost of production). Footnote #2) It’s not all wine and roses for the gas-fired generators As the NEM-Review chart above highlights, spot revenues (and average spot revenues) have increased for Torrens in recent months. However it’s not a one-way street for them (and gas-fired plant in general), either, given that the influx of wind into the SA region has had the effect of curtailing volumes of production (significantly for Torrens – chart not provided here to save space). This is important for plant with high capital cost. Furthermore (unlike wind) these gas generators have non-negligible short-run marginal costs of generations. Many others have posted about how gas prices have surged at the Adelaide hub of the STTM (and we understand that costs for transport have also escalated). These factors will have combined to moderate the profitability of the higher spot revenues received (beyond whatever hedges have been in place) for gas-fired generators.",

    "title": "Increased complexity, and challenges, in this energy transition",
    "date": "19-08-2016 02:10:00 PM",
    "content": "In between other jobs, I’ve been working my way through all the slides that the Clean Energy Council has published on behalf of the speakers at the Clean Energy Summit (which I’d noted before I was going to attend ). One of the challenges in events like this is (given the multi-stream approach) in picking the right session to attend, and then to give the speaker my full attention. 1) I did attend part of the “Market Trends and Outlook” session, but for some reason a particular slide from Kobad Bhavnagri of BNEF (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) did not resonate with me at the time , but has now on review. 2) Unfortunately it seems that this was also the case with other media commentators (both the “new” ones and the “old” ones as well) at the event, as I did not see any commentary about it. This is a shame because (in my view) it sums up the challenges inherent in the transition towards more independently variable (and only partially controllable) forms of supply options – namely solar PV, wind (and also battery storage). Given the high level of interest in today’s COAG Energy Minister’s meeting in Canberra, I have (with the permission of Kobad ) included this here for your reference: Particularly relevant (in my view) are: Key point #1) The note that power system management is becoming more complex It stands to reason that this increasing complexity, which we’ve not had to grapple with before in our more “simple” past, brings with it new challenges. This is what I have been trying to explain (perhaps not as well?) in a number of recent posts here on WattClarity . Key point #2) That this complexity applies over a number of different time-scales . This is an important point which sometimes seems to be missed, or forgotten, in the various discussions underway about this energy transition – for instance, someone might be thinking in the “years-months ahead” (planning) horizon when speaking, but the listener is thinking in the “days – minutes ahead” (dispatch) horizon, meaning that the messages become confused and the conversation sub-optimal. For those who are BNEF subscribers, here’s the link that Kobad’s slide references – to their publication “Flexibility Series – the problem with wind and solar” . Also worth noting from the same session is the slide here from David Swift from the AEMO that nicely follows Kobad’s segue above: With respect to this slide, I would like to draw out two points (stressing that this is my interpretation , not the AEMO’s): Key point #1) AEMO has noted that there are challenges, not problems: With any contentious issue (such as what we are facing at several levels in this energy transition) choice of language, unfortunately, takes on a heightened importance – which is why AEMO has stressed that there are not “problems” (with the possible inference being that they are insurmountable), but that they are challenges. Indeed, some see them as big opportunities. This is the point I’ve strived to make to those at the right-end of the Emotion-o-meter . Also today I noted that Tristan Edis has commented over here about the use of the word “crisis” (another loaded term). Whilst it may not be a crisis: (a) It’s certainly proved very painful for a number of different stakeholders affected in different ways – such as through escalated spot prices, and also through escalating forward contract prices; (b) As others have noted, it is a reminder that more detailed planning is required than has been the case in the past. Key point #2) That tackling these challenges is still a work-in-progress . The AEMO has noted that there will be solutions found (and implemented) to tackle these challenges – but a key point here is that they are not yet found, or implemented. The challenges are not solved, but are solvable. There’s a high volume of discussion currently focused on potential solutions to these challenges (or, even further upstream, trying to clearly understand and describe the challenges). Unfortunately these discussions seem to be: (a) Perhaps used, by a subset of people towards the right of the Emotion-o-meter, as guise for more general resistance to change; but also (b) Misconstrued by others (perhaps also deliberately, by a subset) at the left-end of the Emotion-o-meter who label all those involved in the conversation as “being hostage to fossil fuel interests” etc… (whereas reality is not just black and white). My sense is that this simplistic view is where the rhetoric arises about the need to “break the NEM” etc. Given BNEF is often quoted by many at the progressive end of the energy transition, Kobad’s slide particularly resonated with me – though it was an opportunity foregone that it was not more widely communicated. Perhaps this post will help?",

    "title": "Another day where LOR2 notice issued for SA – what does it mean?",
    "date": "10-08-2016 11:39:00 AM",
    "content": "A NEM-Watch SMS alert this morning made me aware of the fact that AEMO had issued a Market Notice (at 07:52) notifying market participants (and a diverse range of interested spectators like us) about the heightened risk that our South Australian friends face today as a result of a number of factors, including some of the longer list identified here a couple weeks ago. Details of the market notice are recorded here, for ease of reference: The key text being as follows: “ If a credible contingency event occurs in this period the South Australia region would separate from the rest of the NEM and is likely to result in interruptions to power supplies .” In shorthand, this means that if something happens (like the critical imports from Victoria tripping – a low probability event, but still a credible one, and so one AEMO needs to plan for) then South Australia would not have enough local supplies that could be dispatched in time to keep the SA system stable, so portion of SA load would be turned off (i.e. some lights would go out) to keep the broader system in South Australia online. Looking at the Energy Layer (i.e. the default one) within NEM-Watch , we see some of the contributing factors: To sum up my understanding of some of the factors: 1) Plenty of wind in South Australia currently, making it uneconomic to run much thermal plant currently (especially with today’s gas price still $7.89/GJ at the Adelaide hub); 2) This is especially the case as the Heywood link constrained to flow west currently (i.e. South Australia can’t export its “economically surplus” wind), driving prices in South Australia lower; 3) Not much thermal plant running, so not as much capability to ramp up production in South Australia if needed, hence the LOR2 notice. Again, let me reiterate our position in that: 1) We’re striving to remain technology agnostic ; and that 2) We’re also striving to remain away from either extreme of the “Emotion-o-Meter” that’s kicking up an increasing amount of heat about the previously (still?) arcane nuances of keeping the electricity system spinning at 3000rpm from Cairns to Port Augusta. Presumably following the Market Notice, I received this question from Tom Butler at the Clean Energy Council on Twitter about the flow-through to FCAS pricing: Assuming a broader level of interest in today’s machinations I thought I would invest an hour this morning to put this brief post together – hence to finish off I toggled NEM-Watch to look at the Raise Regulation FCAS commodity* to see what was happening. My layman’s explanation of “Raise Regulation” FCAS is that it has to do with some generators agreeing with AEMO (in return for some small compensation) to keep a bit of “spare” capacity in reserve (i.e. not have it dispatched in the energy market), ready to give the system a (very quick) extra kick should the system suddenly slow below 3000rpm. This (frequency drop) would be what would happen in South Australia at these points in time shown if: (a) the interconnector was to trip or (b) some generator (wind, or gas) in SA was to trip. No surprise, really, to see these prices elevated in South Australia as a result of current machinations as AEMO tries to “keep a bit more up its sleeve” within South Australia to cater for what might happen if these “credible contingencies” were to occur: However the key take-away is that, even with this increased local procurement of Raise Regulation FCAS in South Australia, AEMO still sees the risk that load shedding would be necessary if a large “credible contingency” were to happen in South Australia currently, due to factors such as high wind and reduced interconnector capacity. Looking at all 9 commodities together (i.e. Energy and the 8 x FCAS prices) across all 5 regions, remembering that all 45 prices are produced in the same co-optimised NEMDE dispatch run to minimise total cost to the market for that dispatch interval, we see each dispatch interval continuing to bounce around with both Lower Regulation FCAS and Lower 6-second FCAS also slightly elevated in South Australia: This is a “NEM Prices” widget in ez2view , one of thousands available to clients. The AEMC has received rule change proposals from the South Australian Government, and also from AGL, that are pertaining to these vexed issues: 1) SA Government about “Managing the rate of change of power system frequency” 2) SA Government about “Emergency frequency control schemes for generation deficit events” 3) SA Government about “Emergency frequency control schemes for generation surplus events” (sort of like the current situation) 4) SA Government about “Managing power system fault levels” 5) AGL about “Inertia ancillary services” . My sense is that this is just another example of the tricky commercial/technical challenges that will need to be solved (but have not yet been) as this broad-reaching energy transition carries on, and picks up steam (pardon the pun – as, in fact, the volume of steam available will reduce over time, which is part of the challenge) . The rule change proposals above suggest that others also see challenges that still need to be resolved . It’s very unfortunate (and adds to the systemic risk the energy sector faces, in my view) that the “debate” about this energy transition seems to have devolved to a situation where a vocal sub-set of stakeholders seem to both: 1) View “incumbency” as a pejorative ; whilst 2) Viewing anything labelled “disruptive” * as a panacea . * even if others might see a label of “disruptive” as more like wishful thinking, in some instance Instead, let’s consider each suggestion on its merits – and importantly both the pros and cons? Note that any errors made in the interpretation above are definitely mine and not AEMO’s or AER’s or AGL’s! PS – AEMO Cancelled the Reserve Notice at 11:35",

    "title": "How have weather patterns influenced Victorian electricity demand so far this winter?",
    "date": "08-08-2016 07:34:00 AM",
    "content": "With all the active discussion surrounding the unique energy pricing patterns within the National Electricity Market this winter season (including here on WattClarity, about Q2 ), I thought it might prove useful to provide a quick debrief on how the weather side of things have gone so far this year. In particular, I’ll show the state of temperatures so far this year in Melbourne , as well as what climatic factors have been driving the weather patterns this winter season – and what is still yet to come for the NEM. Winter 2016 (so far) in Melbourne A good place to start for winter temperatures is in Melbourne, and I’ve done that by comparing Effective Degree Days in Victoria state so far this year vs. recent years. Effective Degree Days, or EDDs , are a common benchmark for approximating the weather factor in Victorian daily gas consumption – combining temperature , wind , cloud cover , and time of year into a single value that strongly correlates with daily gas demand when included with other non-weather factors (e.g. weekday vs. Saturday/Sunday). The graph below summarises the observed EDD values of Winter 2016 so far, compared to a recent 15-year climatology: In terms of cumulative EDD values , July 2016 ended at a value that is 62 degree days below climatology, or about 8% below normal . In this graph, climatology is defined as the 15-year period of 2000 to 2014, in order to eliminate the warming trend of recent decades in Melbourne. In other words, this year’s warmer-than-normal winter in Melbourne cannot be fully explained by climate change alone, since the warming trend is minimal when looking only at the past 15 years. Indeed, other factors are clearly in play this winter, and are discussed below. When looking at daily EDD values , there have been three distinct stretches of colder-than-normal temperatures this winter season. While the majority of April and May were much warmer than normal, daily EDD values have generally been at or above normal values since late May. In other words, the main culprit for this winter season being below normal overall is the lack of early-season cool spells, and has since “caught up” somewhat, with June 2016 best described as colder than normal for Melbourne, and July seeing near-normal winter weather conditions. So what’s going on? It is no coincidence that this late-May pattern change aligned with the ending of the strong El Nino event of 2015-16 , and with the rapid onset of a negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) event . A breakdown of El Nino is typically associated with heavier-than-normal rainfall for south-eastern Australia, as well as above normal temperatures. This is precisely what occurred during the spring months this year. However, the climatic factor that best explains this winter season’s weather pattern so far, as well as what is expected over the coming months, is the strong negative IOD event that quickly set up during May and June of this year. While both positive & negative IOD events have each historically occurred about once every five years, negative IOD events have been scarcer than normal in recent decades. Until this year, there had not been one since 2010, and you have to go back to 1996 to find another. Looking specifically at the August-to-October timeframe, negative IOD events have a strong correlation with expected temperature and precipitation patterns across Australia. With regards to the NEM, it is evident in the Bureau of Meteorology maps here that maximum temperatures are significantly reduced for much of the Southern NEM, while minimum temperatures are largely unaffected. This lines up well with the above-normal precipitation that is seen during negative IOD events, which limits the potential for daytime heating, and also minimises the chance of cool mornings. Looking ahead, our MetraWeather seasonal forecast predicts that these climatic factors will allow EDD values to continue their catch-up through the late winter and spring months, with colder-than-normal temperatures expected for August, September, and October. What does this mean for Summer 2016-17? MetraWeather will be issuing our next seasonal forecast this week, which will be the first issue that aims to quantify extreme hot days across the National Electricity Market. This forecast is heavily affected by both the ongoing negative IOD event, as well as the potential upcoming La Nina event. The negative IOD event is expected to fade as Summer 2016-17 approaches, but more importantly, the potential for a La Nina event is the primary factor to consider when forecasting extreme hot days across the National Electricity Market WattClarity® readers may wish to refer back to my prior notes here about extreme heat and ENSO .

    "title": "The war for dispatch: Who will control distributed energy?",
    "date": "04-08-2016 12:24:00 PM",
    "content": "In today’s energy sector, it is rare to get electricity networks, retailers, generators and system controllers in the same room at the same time. Of course, before about 1990, all of these roles worked almost side-by-side within vertically integrated companies where corridors and meeting rooms were places of negotiation and arbitration of all of the differing incentives and drivers. But in a deconstructed market about to be transformed by distributed energy, how will decisions be made around how it is dispatched? Different players, different drivers While we’ve gained much through the unbundling of electricity markets, what we’ve lost is sometimes overlooked. Apart from pleasantries over coffee and personal relationships, deconstructed markets leave little room for open, incentive-free discussions about issues facing the entire sector. In most reformed markets, this is left to government and regulators to sort out, and so is limited by the scope of whatever inquiries or policies they are charged with developing. When we do manage to get networks, retailers, generators and system controllers all in the one room, as I witnessed recently, conversation quickly turns to disruption and the changing nature of our industry. With growing amounts of utility scale renewables entering the system, the emergence of IT integrated battery and solar equipment, and the rise of virtual power plants, the first hour of these discussions tends to lead to consensus that we live in interesting times. It is the second hour that this blog is devoted to. One of the interesting features of disruption is that everyone assumes they will be the one doing the disrupting, or at least controlling the way in which it will occur. But distributed energy will impact each player in the sector differently and each will be driven by different reasons for involvement: For retailers , and the new entrants soon to be troubling them, distributed energy provides a way to finally interact with customers on a basis which is less transactional and more “asset rich” (see my blog on this topic here ). Their attraction to distributed energy lies in the ability to dispatch the contents of customers’ batteries at a time when that power is worth the most to them, giving a share of the benefits back to the customer. But for this to occur, the retailer must be able to decide when dispatch occurs, and the basis on which it will occur – perhaps on the basis of avoiding high wholesale prices or perhaps on the basis of the highest offer received. For network companies , distributed energy provides a mechanism to flatten the peak and avoid network capex, primarily by shifting load within and around the network to avoid upgrading system equipment. This in turn requires the network company to be able to decide when dispatch occurs, based on the timing of the network peak that it is seeking to avoid. For system controllers if distributed energy becomes mainstream through rapid residential penetration, its invisibility poses a risk to system balancing (see my blog on this topic here ). This means that the system controller must be able, via some mechanism, to determine when dispatch occurs, based on overall system balancing requirements. Can we afford to let the market decide? But most conversations around distributed energy rely upon an assumption that the timing of all three of these dispatch drivers will align. In reality, there is little or no relationship between them. Wholesale price spikes occur due to a range of reasons including weather, unexpected outages of plant or networks, but are almost completely unrelated to the timing of the distribution peak. System control interventions generally follow unexpected drops in either supply or demand, and while these bear some relationship to wholesale price spikes, these are average impacts and do not reflect the wholesale trading book of any particular retailer. Allowing the market to solve this would involve the establishment and resolution of dispatch decisions on financial, rather than engineering, grounds. Under this market system for dispatch, networks would bid against the internal business drivers of the retailer to seek dispatch at the time of the network peak, which would be balanced against the internal opportunities open to the retailer not to dispatch or to dispatch at another time depending on their trading positions. This would, of course, expose the network company to the risk of not winning, and so require a network investment to be made anyway to ensure that reliability was not impacted. In this way, a market system would remove from the network company any actual benefits from distributed energy. The role of the system controller is even less flexible. Who controls the button is therefore one of the most critical questions to be answered around distributed energy. Twenty years ago, this would have been solved behind closed doors, with arguments made and settlements achieved for the good of the network. In today’s energy sector, the environment for decision making is very different. Let the battle for dispatch begin. Who will, or should, win the war for dispatch?

    "title": "If I was going to assess Factors Contributing to the “truly remarkable” Q2 2016 prices, here are some starting places I’d look…",
    "date": "25-07-2016 11:05:00 AM",
    "content": "At the turn of the quarter, I posted this analysis of some truly remarkable prices we’d been observing as Q2 2016 unfolded . Since that time, the context provided on WattClarity has been working its way into commentary provided by various other parties – both new media and old media. Unfortunately, some clumsy wording in a number of places has led to me fielding a number of questions from people who’d inferred (reading 2nd hand) that my analysis had either: (i) pointed the finger at wind – as in “wind is to blame”; or (ii) not pointed the finger at wind depending on the reader’s own perspective. This has, unfortunately, been a bit of a distraction given everything we have going in our “day job” at present. (A) Reiterating our focus Hence I reiterate 3 points: A1) We see the energy transition* as much broader than a specific focus on de-carbonising the energy sector by whatever the method; As I’ve noted before , the “energy transition” encapsulates responses to concerns about climate change concerns, rapid technology advancement in terms of supply options and also in terms of consumption and management of the grid, and raised customer awareness and price responsiveness (at least for some). A2) In terms of the current debate* with respect to renewables targets, we strive to remain technology agnostic (or, to state it another way, we’re not at either end of the “emotion-o-meter” ); I call it a “debate” but in truth have sadly been seeing it more and more as a pre-schooler shouting match between different groups of kids in the playground that all contributed to the mess they are confronted with, but devolve to inane name calling that achieves no real resolution: “He started it”, “No she did”, “Did not”, “Did too”, oscillating to crescendo and drowning out the more reasoned perspectives. All very disappointing for the broader energy supply industry – which is, at the same time, all of the following: (i) Essential service at home and at work (particularly in places such as hospitals etc); (ii) Major driver of our economy (some decoupling has begun, but it remains a very significant driver) and hence a major indirect employer, and contributor to investment returns etc…; and (iii) Significant direct employer. Surely we can do better than this! For instance, the AEMC has recently started a Review of market frameworks for power system security . I do hope that we can see some more reasoned perspectives from all involved with this. A3) We’re much more interested in thinking through the implications of the change in pricing patterns, rather than through the causal factors. This would be especially the case if these changes to pricing patterns do prove to be systemic (as some indicators do point to being the case): It’s in this spirit that I posted last week about potential challenges for demand response if these pricing patterns continue into the future . In reading that article please keep in mind that this was written with respect to our experience in supporting a particular form of demand response at a number of major industrial energy users across the NEM. A number of major energy users in Tasmania experienced a rather unwanted form of demand response through the first half of the year which must be weighing on their minds when sizing up any major investment decisions in future. Despite how we’re much keener to think through potential “Implications”, circumstances do seem to keep trying to drag us back into that rabbit hole that is “Causes” (or “smoking guns” to some) …. B) Some things I’d think about, if I jumped into the rabbit hole For the benefit of those who’ve contacted me one-on-one with questions, here’s a starting list of things I’d puzzle through (keeping in mind the question of “Implications?” in all of this)… B1) Systemic issues with EVERY fuel type currently used in the NEM Let’s start with the basics – no fuel type (or generation technology) is perfect . A couple years ago I posted these comments about attempts to privatise profits (whilst socialising costs) with respect to wholesale market supply . These challenges remain. More recently I’ve become increasingly aware that all of the major fuel types used in supplying electricity in the NEM faces some their own discrete, systemic, significant challenges , moving forwards. B1a) Systemic (global) issue with Coal Barring some major cost reductions in the technology of carbon capture and storage, it seems pretty clear that coal is in terminal decline – with the only question being how many years (how many decades) this will play out over. A new coal-fired power station in the context of the NEM would not be investable. We still have a sizeable fleet of old plant across the east coast that still provides the lion’s share of electricity supplies for the NEM (see today’s current share here ). In the absence of other influences, these assets could be a little like “grandfather’s axe” and be progressively refurbished to continue supplying power decades into the future. However economic and social pressures being brought to bear are changing the mix – as a result of which we’re seeing the older plants progressively close – like Redbank {though there might be a repowering in the works?}, Munmorah, Wallerawang , Anglesea and recently Northern in South Australia . (i) Given the seeming inevitability of the end of coal as a power generation source as the existing fleet progressively switch off, my “clapped out old car” analogy talks to the risks of systemic higher forced outage rates – leading to higher risk of coincident forced outage . (ii) Given the ongoing oversupply of capacity in the NEM, it is probable (we have not checked, so this is speculation at this point) that generators won’t feel as pressured in relation to outage planning for routine maintenance now, compared to days of yesteryear. Back when supply/demand was tight, and demand growing reliably, generation companies focused on shaving outage times and reducing risk of schedule overruns. Given the price and volume issues they have been facing more generally in more recent times, where’s the incentive to work 24×7 through outages over a few high-stress weeks in order to ensure the plant is back for a certain date? The downside of a slippage seems to have been reduced. It’s certainly been noted elsewhere that there have been coal plant in VIC, NSW and QLD offline during the Q2 period, and more recently in Q3 – hence reducing available capacity. (iii) These systemic issues with coal fired power are not made any easier by the types of local disagreements unfolding between unions and management at Loy Yang A power station (reported here by the AFR , the Australian , the ABC (and the counterparties AGL and CFMEU (though that one’s not recent)). Taking the above into account, a 21-21.5% pay rise offer over 4 years that is still unacceptable to the workplace at a facility that is in structural decline does seem a bit odd. All factors to consider – with respect to what’s been happening more recently, but also in terms of what the implications are for the future. B1b) Systemic issue with Gas Gas-fired generation has been often talked about in recent weeks. Keeping in mind that the following image was tweeted particularly with reference to volatile electricity/gas prices during July, and I’m ostensibly posting about what happened in Q2, it certainly sums up well how the electricity and gas markets are now joined-at-the-hip : What’s more, as an industry we have made the correlation more significant, in a bad way (from the perspective of the electricity market) by, simultaneously: (i) linking domestic gas to the export market; (ii) massively ramping up gas demand (because of export); whilst at the same time (iii) applying the handbrake on the supply side , by imposing and extending moratoriums on new gas development in a number of states. (iv) Coupled with that the fact that we had 3 separate LNG construction projects, all running in parallel but with pretty much zero collaboration – probably contributing to massive blow-out in construction costs , such that not even Santos and Origin shareholders are benefiting from the exports currently. It’s plain to see that the broader gas industry has not covered itself in roses . More directly in the electricity market, we’ve transitioned (over recent years) from known quantities of gas on low-price (e.g. take-or-pay) ramp up gas arrangement towards very uncertainly timed & peaky gas volumes (because of where it sits in the merit order), which has added to the major escalation of gas prices (i.e. not just prices at the hub, but also factoring in transportation charges). If everyone wants gas at the same time, but does not have the certainty to contract for it in advance , it’s no wonder that gas prices have been bouncing around as much as they have of late – which feeds into electricity prices. Where to from here? B1c) Systemic issue with Hydro (and Water, more broadly) Nor is hydro (and water, more generally) looking that flash. This year we have seen the Tasmanian debacle brought about, in no small part, because of climate-challenged rainfall levels affecting all of Tassie’s hydro storages. This was a major contributor to the outcomes seen in Q2 2016 in Tasmania. Thinking more broadly, however, it was only back in 2007 that we saw a NEM-wide calamity, with respect to prices, flowing from a NEM-wide drought that afflicted both the main hydro systems supporting the NEM and several water storages supporting thermal plant. Here’s that summary chart, again: Clearly, water is a key driver of electricity prices – and it’s one that is systemically challenged . As we move into a more climate-challenged world in future, the theory is our rainfall patterns will become more and more patchy (I believe?), which implies strongly that what we’ve seen in 2007 (NEM-wide) and 2016 (NEM-wide) will become more frequent . On top of that, it seems that some are thinking that we can double down on the use of our existing hydro reservoirs as giant batteries for when the wind’s not blowing and the sun’s not shining – without any real consideration (or modelling, to my knowledge) of: (i) The huge difference in power requirements between existing capacity and demand; and (ii) Transmission limitations in getting it to market; and (iii) The differences in cycle times between potential depletion (if filling the gap in lulls in the wind and solar) and replenishment (mainly from rainfall, given very little is pumped storage); and (iv) The very limited number of actors involved (from the perspective of competitive tension). I know that people have done preliminary work (here’s the Arup-MEI one from 2014 , but I believe there are others) on the possibility of numerous, small, distributed, low-head pumped hydro plant scattered across the NEM, and I look with interest at projects such as what Genex are proposing. Surely we should be doing more , collectively, to work through this challenge? B1d) Systemic issues with Wind The systemic alignment of gas supplies (in terms of both commodity price risk and also in terms of volume risk – which flows through to transport pricing through the nominations process) with electricity has been a significant driver of the outcomes seen during Q2 2016. However there’s an equally problematic issue with the systemic alignment of wind supplies (or lack of wind diversity) , across all existing wind farms (not just those in South Australia). This issue also played a role in outcomes seen through Q2, and ongoing into Q3. I was encouraged to see David Leitch post about several factors (including the lack of diversity) in RenewEconomy last week . I might have missed others, but this seemed to be the first significant article on that site tackling this issue. We’ve been puzzling about lack of diversity in wind product NEM-wide for a number of years, including this look at how wind farms are collectively shooting themselves in the foot as result of this strong correlation with each other. I’ve seen images like the following doing the rounds on twitter in recent weeks, so I’ve taken one and (with apologies to the original author) have annotated to illustrate a major challenge for the NEM, moving forwards … To sum up – wind is certainly not entirely to blame (as a number seem to be insinuating in their commentary – and certainly in their headlines) for what’s been happening in terms of pricing outcomes through Q2, but nor is it entirely innocent either (as another group had seemed to be implying). It would be a (very) great thing for the NEM if wind outputs for large-scale wind plant to be built in the northern part of the NEM in the coming years were to be significantly anti-correlated to the stuff in the southern part . Periodically I have asked a number of project proponents if they could lend me some time-series wind incidence data over past years for their sites in order that I could perform an independent review and post what I find on WattClarity . However no-one has been forthcoming, yet. Hence I am still in the dark on that one – as is the rest of the NEM, I believe? If any of our readers are developing a project in QLD or Northern NSW and could share this data with me, I would extend that invitation to you . Please call me on +61 7 3368 4064 or just email it through . Let’s assume, for a moment, that’s there’s an excellent degree of anti-correlation (i.e. not just independence , but negative correlation) between wind farms in the north and wind farms in the south – this would have the effect of smoothing out wind production NEM-wide, which would be an excellent thing . (i) Unfortunately the LGC is an incentive independent of location, and independent of any price-related-temporal setting . (ii) Does this imply that this method is not a sustainable solution for encouraging the development of the “right” projects (by that measure)? (iii) The fact that no projects have been developed in QLD save for the tiny Windy Hill project over how-many-years of the MRET existence is a pretty clear indication that something’s gotta change if we’re going to get to the large percentages of renewables talked about in some targets. B1e) Systemic issue with Solar PV? Solar power is a relative newcomer to the NEM – and, in truth, the growth in buzz has preceded a growth in its real impact by a number of years. However it’s continuing to grow, and looks set to continue that trajectory. One good point to note is that, at least for now, the NIMBY concerns that seem to have beset wind, gas production, transmission development, possible nuclear and pretty much anything else has not yet beset small-scale solar PV (I do recall reading some NIMBY type concerns relating to early large-scale solar plant around Canberra). In terms of systemic challenges to deal with in relation to solar PV, there’s the obvious case that it’s all correlated towards the middle of the day (NEM-wide). This means the same sort of challenge as I have sketched with wind above – in that there’s declining value from incrementally more solar PV in the energy market as the “duck curve” takes hold . What was far more perplexing to me , at least from the very cursory review I posted here , is that there appears to be an apparent alignment of something (massive cloud cover?) suppressing solar output across the-whole-NEM on certain days – we see in the chart in the article above that the 4th June (in particular) shows low levels of output across QLD, NSW and VIC, with only SA solar PV generation levels bucking the trend (and Tassie being too small to really see, in this case). Given a number of weeks have passed since that article, I powered up NEM-Review to provide this updated comparison: As can be seen, aggregate output over different days varies as much as 3.5 times , according to the data! That’s a stunning variability (at least to me) considering that the data is supposed to represent rooftop solar NEM-wide! Now, as I noted in the original article, this outcome might have resulted from inaccurate (somewhat independent) estimation methods used by both the APVI and by AEMO: (i) At the very least, this illustrated the urgency at which the NEM requires much better data on what our growing fleet of small-scale rooftop solar PV is performing, right across the NEM. The AEMO is investing heavily in this – what can we do, as an industry, to speed up the process and make it work better? (ii) If it turns out to be that there is actually a problem in that some days will see output at a small fraction of what would normally be expected NEM-wide, then it does make me wonder about the depth to which these types of variability’s have been modelled in the energy transition studies frequently quoted as “proving” one particular future scenario. As I have said before – every model’s just a model, it’s not reality (though some might be useful)! It’s probably not as relevant for Q2 2016 price outcomes (with the contribution being relatively small at this point) but it will be something to watch in future. One other thing to watch (not so relevant to Q2 2016 but moreso for the longer term) will be the rate of decline in performance of the widely distributed (and variously aged) rooftop solar PV across the country. I expect that most of it won’t be proactively maintained, with a share of home owners only finding out that their system is failed when their energy bill changes significantly in a given billing period. Given the dispersed nature, and (I assume) the lack of intensive monitoring, my sense is that these generation assets will perform differently than the electricity industry has become accustomed to over recent decades. (i) Whereas in the past we’ve had a few big plant that have operated under the oversight of professional engineers who’ve utilised plenty of instrumentation, perhaps we’re transitioning to a world with less instrumentation and intensive monitoring. (ii) In planning processes, such as the AEMO Statement of Opportunity, does this mean the need to focus much more on the supply side of the equation – in terms of how “existing capacity” might perform a few years out into the future. Does some kind of decay rate need to be assumed (with the rate progressively tuned to what’s actually observed in terms of real outputs from older systems)? This is another technical & organisational challenge that surely can be solved – perhaps it’s part of a new role for our reborn energy retailer in this transitioned energy sector? B1f) What about other supply technologies not deployed in the NEM currently? What about them? … I mean, really, what about them? Each have their own advocates – but they are not here. History would suggest that, unless something significant changes , they probably won’t be deployed enmasse in any reasonable time period. To sum up, we have the majority of electricity supply still provided by coal-fired generation (a technology in terminal decline), with all of the other supply options currently being used facing their own individual, systemic (NEM-wide) challenges . Not an environment for “easy” problem solving, especially in such a politically charged (toxic?) environment at present. B2) Lack of Competition I’m running out of time today – but just wanted to touch on a couple more contributing factors that have been mentioned in recent weeks. Particularly with respect to South Australia, “lack of competition” has been cited as a contributing factor. Unfortunately South Australia, being a small region in relation to electricity consumption, faces a fundamentally harder task of sustaining sufficient competition than do the QLD, NSW and VIC regions. In similarly sized Tasmania, for instance, the “market” has evolved to a form of regulated market with a single wholesale supplier setting prices under a form of regulation that some of our readers will be better placed to explain succinctly. B2a) Competition within the South Australian region – in the good times If I had more time, I would look in more detail – but my sense is that during the good times the influx of wind generation has created an environment where there are plenty of different participants all independently supplying the market (i.e. independent of the technology they choose). What’s particularly interesting is that many of the wind farm projects are operated by companies that are: (i) Small (in terms of both MW capacity and MWh supplied); and (ii) Independent from each other; and (iii) Somewhat independent from the companies operating thermal portfolios in the region. Hence this does point to a good competitive market outcome. I did previously note how AGL Energy does have a large share of wind production , and I wonder what effect (if any) this has on portfolio management between their gas and wind assets in the state? To sum up, in the “good times”, there’s a plentiful mix of competitors in the state. B2b) Competition within the South Australian region – in the not-so-good times However, in the “not-so-good” times, the outcome is such that it can be thought of as deriving from two sequential events: (i) When the wind stops, it has the same effect (in terms of setting the price) as if all the wind farms in the state collectively bid their capacity above the Market Price Cap, so as not to be dispatched (even though they are operated by many different participants); and (ii) Unfortunately the situation is compounded by having gas-fired plant bidding their aggregate capacity higher, as well. Hence the two systemic factors (lack of wind diversity + gas/electricity linkage) combine to mean that the plentiful competitors there in the “good” times disappear during the “not so good” times. B2c) Inter-regional supplies Clearly with the situation in South Australia at present, a larger interconnector allowing more imports from Victoria at times when the wind’s not been blowing would have had a significant effect on suppressing the price on some occasions (though noting that the price patterns observed were NEM-wide, and also that increased export capacity could also have the effect of lifting prices from current very low levels when the wind’s blowing). There seem to be essentially two main pieces of the puzzle to think through with respect to interconnections: (i) Firstly, it will be important to ascertain what the steady-state interconnection capacity should be* in order to achieve a competitive market outcome in South Australia (not withstanding the constraints imposed on what can be classed as a benefit under the “Market Benefits Test” in the RIT-T). * note that these considerations would run in parallel (but won’t be identical) to considerations of what the capacity should be from a security of supply standpoint, given the lower amount of high inertia capacity now operating in South Australia, and the possibility that this might decline further in future years with other thermal plant closure. (ii) Secondly, it will be necessary to think through how to sequence the implementation of upgrades (given the painful irony that some of the price outcomes seen in SA have resulted from short-term work necessary to deliver the upgrade that will deliver long-term benefits). Given the growing number of significant, independently-varying parameters that the TNSPs need to consider in planning high-Capex augmentation works in order to minimise the market impact of transmission congestion (whilst managing within their Capex budget), their job is getting progressively more complicated. I’d like to have more time to think through this one, as well… B3) Market reform Coupled with the above, there’s been growing calls for “reform” (though I suspect that catch-all means different things to different people). Amongst those making the call are the Grattan Institute , several politicians have made the call, and last week I noted that the Clean Energy Council released this note calling for an “honest discussion about energy in South Australia” , linked to this short report that analysed some of the points raised above. I’ve run out of time to think more about this today and need to climb back up out of the rabbit hole… I attended the Energy Networks 2016 conference in Adelaide back in May and was pleasantly surprised to see that the overall mood of the audience was a lot more positive than in the past events I had been at. My sense was there is a growing collective realisation amongst the network businesses that: 1) they had been part of the problem (in getting us to the current position) – but that 2) they could also be part of the solution (though this would take a mindset shift, which might be harder for some than for others). The work that the Energy Networks Association has been doing with the CSIRO in describing 4 different (and each plausible) scenarios for this industry transformation has helped to facilitate a more mature discussion about the future, in my view. Obviously there’s a way to go on this journey. This week I will be at the 2016 Clean Energy Summit in Sydney . In the light of all that’s gone on in the current weeks, I would hope to see a similar progression from another sector of this broad industry where (like the network businesses): 1) the clean energy sector has contributed to the problem – but that 2) it can be a large part of a mature and sustainable solution. No technology is perfect. We’ve all contributed to the problem. With each of the main ones used in the NEM, there appears to be separate (yet interrelated) significant systemic challenges. Each are serious challenges that will need to be addressed – the problems are all not solved, but they are solvable. A mature discussion of the energy transition will incorporate a reasoned discussion about the technical and commercial aspects of strengths and weaknesses of all of these.",

    "title": "Win, lose or draw: Three scenarios for the electricity system in 2030",
    "date": "20-07-2016 03:33:00 PM",
    "content": "Cast your mind back 15 years to 2016. You probably don’t remember this, but 15 years ago people still debated whether the growth of distributed energy would fundamentally transform the Australian electricity system. Sure, there were a million and a half operating solar projects. Elon Musk was selling shiny new batteries into the Australian marketplace along with a range of very fast electric cars. Google had purchased a smart home thermostat supplier for $3.2 billion. But most Australians had no idea that the electricity network’s makeover had begun and would soon upend a century-old industry. Why not? Because 15 years ago the major players in the electricity industry — utilities, distributed energy providers, regulators and policymakers alike — had not yet firmed their own approaches to the growing wave of distributed energy. And as a result, multiple potential futures lay ahead. Version one: Aimless transformation It started with solar power. Solar technology had been around since the 1950s, but a combination of rapid cost declines, (overly) generous state incentives and new financing models led to an installation boom beginning in 2010. By the middle of 2016, Australia was home to over 5 gigawatts of solar power generating capacity, which had almost reached 2.5 percent of all electricity generation in the national market. Previous state and federal incentives, meant that solar was already cheaper than residential retail electricity, and new utility-scale solar cost less than AUD$0.10 per kilowatt-hour, making the technology competitive with traditional resources. Already, solar made up a significant share of all new generating capacity in Australia. And costs continued to fall, trending toward AUD$1.20 per watt for a fully loaded utility-scale system by 2020. Energy retailers developed a complex relationship with solar. On one hand, some retailers were happy to own and operate solar projects. The majority however signed power purchase agreements for the output from solar projects, increasingly doing so beyond consumer demand. The “PV as a service” market also proliferated with retailers providing residential installations for $0 upfront on fixed 10-year contracts. Commercial and industrial solar PV proliferated as the relentless cost reductions forced even the most conservative businesses to adopt the cost savings from distributed generation. Fortunately, the Australian experience avoided the net-metering debates that raged across the US. Electricity networks continued to connect each new solar installation, but were becoming increasingly nervous about the disparity between energy based income and demand driven expenditures. This pent up nervousness began to exhibit itself with moves to alter tariff structures to target PV, limitations on PV exports and high connection charges. Now, as 2020 approached, load defection threatened the networks from two sides. Residential consumers increasingly installed their own generation (mostly solar), reducing their net power consumption by 75 percent or more. As the residential solar market grew, this had a slight impact on other consumers’ bills, but a much larger one on the network earnings. Networks in many states sought to increase the fixed component of consumer bills. But with a few notable exceptions, the changes were incremental and insufficient to stem the flow of distributed solar growth. In the isolated cases where high access charges or export prohibitions did stop solar in its tracks, the respite was brief. These changes simply added incentives for solar consumers to add battery storage and/or load control. The economics didn’t make sense initially, but by 2020 the residential solar market picked back up, this time largely incorporating energy storage and controllable loads which were optimized against these hastily designed tariff structures. Meanwhile, retailers and networks also began to contend with load defection from their largest consumers. In many states, large end users took advantage of direct access tariffs, allowing them to purchase power directly from a renewable energy facility. Elsewhere throughout the country, large electricity consumers discovered a variety of mechanisms to procure their power directly from solar and wind facilities. Initially, the biggest impacts were in the most rural areas with high power prices. But as time went on, the opposing trendlines — increasing electricity prices and decreasing solar/storage costs — opened up new markets throughout the country. Networks in Victoria and the ACT that had previously been insulated from the impacts of load defection suddenly had to contend with the same disruption their Northern peers had faced years earlier, and their South Australian counterparts before that. We reached “peak network” in 2020, but this was no death spiral. It also didn’t make for a positive outlook in the network sector. From the networks’ perspective, their concerns about customer impacts and network reliability were going unheeded as the increasingly loud voices of solar advocates decried the utilities purely as profit-seeking monopolies. In the early 2020s, the trend continued. The Clean Power Plan took effect early in the decade, and many state environmental plans incorporated further incentives for storage and solar. Residential consumers kept installing their own generation and energy storage, more than offsetting the new load coming from increasing adoption of electric vehicles. Large consumers found new ways to control their own power procurement through both on-site and off-site means. And utility earnings continued to erode. It turned out that, as the networks (and their shareholders) suffered, so did consumers. First, as distributed solar penetration grew, cost-shifting became a real issue. When solar represented less than 5 percent of total generation, advocates convincingly argued that it provided a net benefit to the network, and thus to all consumers. But as solar’s share hit 15 percent and then 20 percent as 2030 approached, its value to the network decreased and rates for non-solar consumers increased. Real-time and locational electricity tariffs might have addressed this problem by incentivising load shifting and smart siting, but governments, networks and regulators were slow to adopt changes, and our tariff structures are largely the same today as they were 20 years ago. Compounding this was the move of the system minimum demand from 2am at night to the solar peak (1-2pm) during the dat. The effect of this minimum was to constrain-off large generation plant with insufficient time for it to build back up to the evening peak. This created a both a huge call for fast response (ramp rate) services and exacerbated the already volatile energy price. Less obvious (but just as problematic) was the gradual decline of technological innovation for the distribution network. With utility purchasing power waning and load declining, entrepreneurs and conglomerates alike focused less attention on building solutions to optimize energy delivery and maintain reliability. So while the share of intermittent resources increased, new solutions to manage these resources never quite emerged. That’s how we find ourselves where we are today, in 2030. We have a lot more solar, but electricity prices remain high. Distribution network infrastructure is aging, and its technology has hardly kept up with the growth rate of these new resources. Meanwhile, climate change is a more immediate threat than ever, but we don’t have a clear vision for how to decarbonize the remainder of the electricity network. Version two: The balkanized network It started with solar power, but for a time the rooftop solar business seemed like it had been a short-lived fad. After the states drastically reduced the export value of residential solar, solar companies hoped it would be restored or that a new emissions trading scheme would make up for it. Instead, fixed charges on consumer bills were up, on average, 50 percent over the previous decade. And the generous PV export incentives were gradually removed or fell away. The residential solar market, which had been growing at a rate of over 50 percent per year from 2013-2015, started to shrink beginning in 2017. Some consumers still signed up, mostly preferring to take out short-term loans to finance their rooftop systems and hoping their payback calculations would hold up. But solar companies faced a capital crunch as finance providers balked at the risk of further reducing export values leading to widespread consumer default. Debt service coverage ratios and yields increased, making new solar projects more expensive. Meanwhile, consumer acquisition costs continued to plague residential solar providers as reports of negative value from existing consumers started to reverse the diffusion effect that was prevalent in solar’s earlier days. Where the residential solar industry installed half a gigawatt in 2015, it slowed to less than 50 megawatts by 2020. Although a couple number of states remained attractive solar markets, most of the country did not. Apart from increasing fixed charges and decreasing solar export compensation, electricity tariff structures remained largely stagnant. Time-of-use rates were the exception rather than the norm and were structured based on long peak periods, rather than real- or near-real-time pricing. The incentives for load-shifting and energy storage remained limited, and those markets never quite got off the ground. And so the Australian distributed energy market effectively went dormant by 2020. But energy is a global market, and other countries picked up the slack. Residential solar-plus-storage became the norm in Germany, Japan and the U.S. India became a major market for solar/storage combinations in the early 2020s. And remote island networks throughout the world installed micro-networks, finding them both cheaper and more reliable than traditional island network architectures. Costs for all these solutions continued to decline, businesses were built, and Australia largely missed out. However, the underlying consumer demand for smarter, cheaper, cleaner energy that had fuelled the first wave of residential solar in Australia never disappeared. While network prohibitions and tariff structures sought to reduce DER installations, many customers were sourcing and installing in-house plug-and-play devices to circumvent these restrictions. Distributed energy came roaring back to life in the mid-2020s — this time in the form of true network defection. Three factors contributed to this sudden trend. First, declining global distributed energy resource (DER) technology costs, coupled with continually rising retail electricity rates, meant the economics of cord-cutting looked increasingly attractive for both individual consumers and small groups. Second, the changes enacted at the end of the previous decade — particularly rising fixed charges — increasingly rendered defection the only way to leverage the full value of on-site energy resources. Third, rather than bearing the risk of retroactive tariff changes later, capital providers began to prefer to finance projects that did not rely on the underlying network and its regulatory whims. Networks also struggled to work out the level of reliability that customers wanted. Customers with onsite storage had their own backup power, while those without storage sought increased reliability from the grid. The grid was not capable of providing neighbouring customers with different reliability and quality services and this resulted in a network that never really met the needs of any customer. Network defection ultimately came in three forms. First, individual residential consumers began to defect in across the peri-urban and suburban fringes, and then in other areas with high electricity prices. Consumers in high bushfire risk areas were provided additional state-based incentives to cut the wires. Utilities and regulators were surprised to learn how many consumers would accept slightly lower reliability in exchange for cheaper, self-controlled power. Second, local communities, neighbourhoods and housing developments extended the models of community choice aggregation and local power-sharing to fully islanded micro-networks. Some communities utilized blockchain technology to introduce novel methods of energy and cost sharing within a small network. Third, large consumers such as hospitals and university campuses found that, even with high reliability requirements, they could leverage their purchasing power and recent technology innovation to save money without relying on their local distribution network. Since 2025, the electricity industry has been in crisis. The majority of defecting consumers have been in higher income brackets, while the remaining network consumers have been left with ever-increasing electricity costs. Electricity networks and customers in states with significant defection are facing real financial strain. Trials of grid-exit fees were hastily discarded after significant consumer backlash. Moves to locational cost-reflective pricing could have preserved the centralised grid from customer defection and provided much clearer identification of inefficient fringe networks. However, the political capital needed to enact this reform was simply too high and the grid became to resemble Swiss-cheese. We reached a dubious milestone earlier this year, when the number of islanded networks in Australia exceeded the number of physical islands in Indonesia. How far this goes — and who gets left behind — is anyone’s guess. Version three: Embracing the transformation It started with solar power and then moved to storage, which led to a series of charged regulatory confrontations from 2014-2019. But as time passed the need to design a regulatory structure that would last gained acceptance. Learnings were drawn from overseas experiments with locational tariffs, smart metering, incorporation of distributed energy into wholesale markets and more. It took some time, but eventually the major parties (utilities, retailers, regulators, policymakers, DER providers, and advocates) agreed on a set of principles (colloquially now referred to as “grid-neutrality”). They agreed that distributed energy resources should be compensated according to their value, including avoided distribution costs and societal/environmental externalities. They recognized the need to protect the prior investments of existing consumers rather than applying changes retrospectively. They agreed that the optimal long-term solution would retain both the electricity networks and the system operators as central components of a distributed energy system, and that profitable network enterprises would benefit the entire system. They realized that tariff structures would need to evolve more quickly to become more location- and time-specific in order to maximize the value (and minimize the systemic cost) of all the new resources that would soon emerge on the network. They expressed willingness to cross-subsidize or provide financial support where necessary to ensure equal reliability and affordability for all electricity consumers. Though these principles were crystallized through the “Power of Choice 2” regulatory proceedings, they quickly spread throughout the national market as 2020 approached. Armed with these principles and newly crafted regulatory incentives intended to guide the future of DERs, networks and retailers felt emboldened to innovate. Some retailers focussed on the aggregator role seeking to bundle DER services to whomever would buy them – any many did. Network augmentation was once the largest capital expenditure across the national grid. This fell to essentially zero as the aggregators bundled their customer DER into meaningful and cost-effective load management. Seeing the value and responsiveness of the aggregated DER, the market for ancillary services was fundamentally reset to facilitate the entry of these services. Connection of new customers to the networks continued apace as new and old community schemes identified the value of grid-backup and export sales. Some retailers acted as front-end consumer acquisition engines for the next wave of DERs, acting as their consumers’ trusted energy advisors. Some opened marketplaces based on the Network Opportunity Mapping of UTS, while others partnered with Google on Project Sunroof and consumer-facing services. Network businesses incorporated DERs into their resource planning processes and began soliciting behind-the-meter resources as an alternative to capital investments in the distribution network. In support of lower-cost DER alternatives, regulators reinforced the mechanisms for networks to earn profit on their procured services. At the urging of large consumers, retailers and networks worked together to tailor green tariff programs and site-specific power purchase agreements for individual consumers. The few consumers who had defected from their utility in the early days remained the exception as retailers and utilities increasingly offered differentiated service based on their large consumers’ needs. In a few instances, networks transformed entirely into platform businesses, managing the network’s operations while facilitating millions of transactions amongst sources of load, generation, storage and ancillary services. Meanwhile, across the country electricity rate structures were reformed based on the new set of shared principles. Rates became more time-variant and location-specific, sending signals for DERs to be sited where their value is highest. Retailers were well positioned to help ratepayers navigate these more complex rates, and many retailers developed a new form of energy auditing focused around savings optimization through DER investment. By the mid-2020s, nearly every major investor-owned network had a new business architecture. Their sources of earnings diversified, which made their businesses more resilient to changes in load growth, commodity prices and technology evolution. Change was not a quick in the government owned networks, but the writing was on the wall. Remote and isolated customers were provided rebates to actively disconnect from the grid. The removal of these most expensive-to-serve customers actually resulted in lower overall grid prices and the savings were shared between customers and the electricity networks under the new compact. Today, the prototypical homeowner has some form of generation, load control and energy storage at her residence. Her personal network infrastructure is optimised for her own savings and load based on the needs of the network. An aggregator bids her capabilities into wholesale markets and periodically for network services. But she doesn’t much notice any of this. She’s just happy that her electricity is efficient, intelligent, automated and cheaper than it was a decade earlier. ShareShare Win, lose or draw: Three scenarios for the electricity system in 2030 Cast your mind back 15 years to 2016. You probably don’t remember this, but 15 years ago people still debated whether the growth of distributed energy would fundamentally transform the Australian electricity system. Sure, there were a million and a half operating solar projects . Elon Musk was selling shiny new batteries into the Australian marketplace along with a range of very fast electric cars . Google had purchased a smart home thermostat supplier for $3.2 billion. But most Australians had no idea that the electricity network’s makeover had begun and would soon upend a century-old industry. Why not? Because 15 years ago the major players in the electricity industry — utilities, distributed energy providers, regulators and policymakers alike — had not yet firmed their own approaches to the growing wave of distributed energy. And as a result, multiple potential futures lay ahead. Version one: Aimless transformation It started with solar power. Solar technology had been around since the 1950s, but a combination of rapid cost declines, (overly) generous state incentives and new financing models led to an installation boom beginning in 2010. By the middle of 2016, Australia was home to over 5 gigawatts of solar power generating capacity, which had almost reached 2.5 percent of all electricity generation in the national market . Previous state and federal incentives, meant that solar was already cheaper than residential retail electricity, and new utility-scale solar cost less than AUD$0.10 per kilowatt-hour , making the technology competitive with traditional resources. Already, solar made up a significant share of all new generating capacity in Australia. And costs continued to fall, trending toward AUD $1.20 per watt for a fully loaded utility-scale system by 2020 . Energy retailers developed a complex relationship with solar. On one hand, some retailers were happy to own and operate solar projects. The majority however signed power purchase agreements for the output from solar projects, increasingly doing so beyond consumer demand. The “PV as a service” market also proliferated with retailers providing residential installations for $0 upfront on fixed 10-year contracts. Commercial and industrial solar PV proliferated as the relentless cost reductions forced even the most conservative businesses to adopt the cost savings from distributed generation. Fortunately, the Australian experience avoided the net-metering debates that raged across the US. Electricity networks continued to connect each new solar installation, but were becoming increasingly nervous about the disparity between energy based income and demand driven expenditures. This pent up nervousness began to exhibit itself with moves to alter tariff structures to target PV, limitations on PV exports and high connection charges. Now, as 2020 approached, load defection threatened the networks from two sides. Residential consumers increasingly installed their own generation (mostly solar), reducing their net power consumption by 75 percent or more. As the residential solar market grew, this had a slight impact on other consumers’ bills, but a much larger one on the network earnings . Networks in many states sought to increase the fixed component of consumer bills. But with a few notable exceptions , the changes were incremental and insufficient to stem the flow of distributed solar growth. In the isolated cases where high access charges or export prohibitions did stop solar in its tracks, the respite was brief. These changes simply added incentives for solar consumers to add battery storage and/or load control. The economics didn’t make sense initially, but by 2020 the residential solar market picked back up, this time largely incorporating energy storage and controllable loads which were optimized against these hastily designed tariff structures. Meanwhile, retailers and networks also began to contend with load defection from their largest consumers. In many states, large end users took advantage of direct access tariffs , allowing them to purchase power directly from a renewable energy facility. Elsewhere throughout the country, large electricity consumers discovered a variety of mechanisms to procure their power directly from solar and wind facilities. Initially, the biggest impacts were in the most rural areas with high power prices. But as time went on, the opposing trendlines — increasing electricity prices and decreasing solar/storage costs — opened up new markets throughout the country. Networks in Victoria and the ACT that had previously been insulated from the impacts of load defection suddenly had to contend with the same disruption their Northern peers had faced years earlier, and their South Australian counterparts before that. We reached “peak network” in 2020, but this was no death spiral . It also didn’t make for a positive outlook in the network sector. From the networks’ perspective, their concerns about customer impacts and network reliability were going unheeded as the increasingly loud voices of solar advocates decried the utilities purely as profit-seeking monopolies. In the early 2020s, the trend continued. The Clean Power Plan took effect early in the decade, and many state environmental plans incorporated further incentives for storage and solar. Residential consumers kept installing their own generation and energy storage, more than offsetting the new load coming from increasing adoption of electric vehicles . Large consumers found new ways to control their own power procurement through both on-site and off-site means. And utility earnings continued to erode. It turned out that, as the networks (and their shareholders) suffered, so did consumers. First, as distributed solar penetration grew, cost-shifting became a real issue. When solar represented less than 5 percent of total generation, advocates convincingly argued that it provided a net benefit to the network , and thus to all consumers. But as solar’s share hit 15 percent and then 20 percent as 2030 approached, its value to the network decreased and rates for non-solar consumers increased. Real-time and locational electricity tariffs might have addressed this problem by incentivising load shifting and smart siting, but governments, networks and regulators were slow to adopt changes, and our tariff structures are largely the same today as they were 20 years ago. Compounding this was the move of the system minimum demand from 2am at night to the solar peak (1-2pm) during the dat. The effect of this minimum was to constrain-off large generation plant with insufficient time for it to build back up to the evening peak. This created a both a huge call for fast response (ramp rate) services and exacerbated the already volatile energy price. Less obvious (but just as problematic) was the gradual decline of technological innovation for the distribution network. With utility purchasing power waning and load declining, entrepreneurs and conglomerates alike focused less attention on building solutions to optimize energy delivery and maintain reliability. So while the share of intermittent resources increased, new solutions to manage these resources never quite emerged. That’s how we find ourselves where we are today, in 2030. We have a lot more solar, but electricity prices remain high. Distribution network infrastructure is aging, and its technology has hardly kept up with the growth rate of these new resources. Meanwhile, climate change is a more immediate threat than ever, but we don’t have a clear vision for how to decarbonize the remainder of the electricity network. Version two: The balkanized network It started with solar power, but for a time the rooftop solar business seemed like it had been a short-lived fad. After the states drastically reduced the export value of residential solar, solar companies hoped it would be restored or that a new emissions trading scheme would make up for it. Instead, fixed charges on consumer bills were up, on average, 50 percent over the previous decade. And the generous PV export incentives were gradually removed or fell away. The residential solar market, which had been growing at a rate of over 50 percent per year from 2013-2015 , started to shrink beginning in 2017. Some consumers still signed up, mostly preferring to take out short-term loans to finance their rooftop systems and hoping their payback calculations would hold up. But solar companies faced a capital crunch as finance providers balked at the risk of further reducing export values leading to widespread consumer default. Debt service coverage ratios and yields increased , making new solar projects more expensive. Meanwhile, consumer acquisition costs continued to plague residential solar providers as reports of negative value from existing consumers started to reverse the diffusion effect that was prevalent in solar’s earlier days. Where the residential solar industry installed half a gigawatt in 2015, it slowed to less than 50 megawatts by 2020. Although a couple number of states remained attractive solar markets, most of the country did not. Apart from increasing fixed charges and decreasing solar export compensation, electricity tariff structures remained largely stagnant. Time-of-use rates were the exception rather than the norm and were structured based on long peak periods, rather than real- or near-real-time pricing. The incentives for load-shifting and energy storage remained limited, and those markets never quite got off the ground. And so the Australian distributed energy market effectively went dormant by 2020. But energy is a global market, and other countries picked up the slack. Residential solar-plus-storage became the norm in Germany , Japan and the U.S . India became a major market for solar/storage combinations in the early 2020s. And remote island networks throughout the world installed micro-networks, finding them both cheaper and more reliable than traditional island network architectures. Costs for all these solutions continued to decline, businesses were built, and Australia largely missed out. However, the underlying consumer demand for smarter, cheaper, cleaner energy that had fuelled the first wave of residential solar in Australia never disappeared. While network prohibitions and tariff structures sought to reduce DER installations, many customers were sourcing and installing in-house plug-and-play devices to circumvent these restrictions. Distributed energy came roaring back to life in the mid-2020s — this time in the form of true network defection . Three factors contributed to this sudden trend. First, declining global distributed energy resource (DER) technology costs, coupled with continually rising retail electricity rates, meant the economics of cord-cutting looked increasingly attractive for both individual consumers and small groups. Second, the changes enacted at the end of the previous decade — particularly rising fixed charges — increasingly rendered defection the only way to leverage the full value of on-site energy resources. Third, rather than bearing the risk of retroactive tariff changes later, capital providers began to prefer to finance projects that did not rely on the underlying network and its regulatory whims.

From memory 2 stages are confirmed proceeding already – but I think there might also be plans for more? Perhaps one of our readers can provide further information in a comment below? Back to current NEM machinations, however – in the chart above we can see how generation (from any source available) cannot come a moment too soon, however, for a region facing a very volatile period currently as a result of multiple factors – including planned transmission outages severely limiting imports from VIC, low wind, and (coincident, and related) high gas prices.

    "title": "Reviewing Q2 prices – short-term excursion, or more systemic change in pricing patterns?",
    "date": "04-07-2016 07:45:00 AM",
    "content": "What a truly remarkable quarter we’ve just finished! I’ve not had time to post much about it here on WattClarity due to other business development commitments, but we’ve been keenly watching what’s been unfolding with our various dashboard-style displays. (a) As Q2 (i.e. April, May, June) progressed, I wondered if we had seen anything of its like beforehand – across all of the 17 x Q2’s that had come before. (b) Hence, before we launch into the next round of business development initiatives, I thought it worthwhile to invest a couple hours to put this review together. As with most times that I have done this, peeling the onion just reveals further layers to peel, more questions to answer . Hence I am left with a number of questions at the end – including perhaps the biggest one: Was Q2 2016 a short-lived excursion, or a more systemic change in pricing patterns? … for that is, literally, the billion-dollar-question, and one that I would imagine many energy sector stakeholders are puzzling about (or at least should be). Whilst the quarter was progressing, I’ve also been trying to keep on top of (or even just briefly skim!) the volume of commentary that’s been posted in the old media, in social media, and by industry organisations. That’s a tall ask, growing taller each quarter with a proliferation of people showing an interest in machinations within what (was formerly / is?) a very arcane industry. The following might be useful a useful starting point to those who are interested. 1) Average prices up across all regions Last week I posted briefly about these exceptional prices , but waited for the end of the quarter to pass before being able to extract full price data from NEM-Review and perform some more detailed number crunching. For a start, we looked at a trend of the 3 core pricing metrics for each quarter – trended over the 18 of these quarters we’ve experienced since NEM start (hence beware of both the discontinuities between the quarters, but the underlying similarities between them in terms of demand shapes and the like). 1a) Queensland trended stats We’ll start at the top of the NEM and work our way around: In these charts, we’ve placed the maximum prices (as bars) on the y2-axis in order to provide for visibility, without compressing the readability of averages (the most important metric) and minimum (included in response to some specific questions we’ve received about whether prices ever do go negative). We’ve also deliberately set the scale to show a line at $30/MWh to highlight how in all years except for 4 particular periods, time-weighted average prices have hovered around the $30/MWh mark – i.e. at, or below what most people would see as Long-Run Marginal Cost (perhaps for pre-existing plant, and certainly for new entrants): 1. In the early years, we see blips in 2000 and 2002 resulting primarily from an undersupplied QLD region prior to QNI (arrived 2001) and new generation (arrived 2001, 2002, 2003) 2. In the drought year of 2007, we see average prices substantially higher due to a NEM-wide shortage of useable capacity 3. In the carbon tax years of 2013 and 2014, we see price elevated by the fixed cost imposed on electricity supplies across the NEM 4. Which brings us to Q2 2016, in what was clearly the second-highest outcome across all 18 years (i.e. more severe than the much maligned carbon tax, and “bettered” only in a year where the supply/demand balance NEM wide was sorely tested). To reduce the risk that some readers might take the above out of context and lay the blame for this outcome singularly at the feet of the “greedy” GOC duopoly (Stanwell and CS) or those (also “greedy”) LNG exporters we’ll move quickly onto NSW… 1b) NSW trended stats At a distance, the chart for NSW looks disturbingly similar… Once again, Q2 2016 in NSW is clearly the standout, with the exception of the drought-ravaged 2007. 1c) Victoria trended stats Down in Victoria, we see a similar picture: The pattern in the trended quarterly average price is so uncannily similar to the ones above for QLD and NSW that I had to check, and re-check, the numbers and spreadsheet references to ensure they were correct. Plus I have added the numbers to the chart that you can see for yourself. 1d) Tasmania trended stats In Tasmania, of course, they’ve been experiencing a whole other world of pain : Tasmania did not join the NEM until part-way through Q2 2005, and that quarter TAS operated literally as an islanded region, as Basslink was not yet connected – this is the reason that average prices for 2005 are off the chart (we kept the same axis for comparability). Unfortunately for Tasmanians, Q2 2016 operated much the same way (i.e. disconnected from the mainland for much of the quarter), as discussed back in March , resulting in much the same high-level outcome as in 2005. As an aside, we see 2013 & 2014 prices in renewable-rich TAS marginally elevated by the fixed price on carbon, though not to the same degree as other regions (and certainly dwarfed by events in other years). 1e) South Australia trended stats Finally we move into South Australia, which has been the focal point for much of the discussion I’ve seen, with the closure of Northern one of the points that’s garnered a share of interest: As with the Queensland region, we see a few notable periods where average prices deviated off that notional $30/MWh benchmark level for what is traditionally a softer quarter: 1. As with Queensland, South Australia was undersupplied in the early years of the NEM 2. As with the other regions, SA was affected by the drought in 2007 – though not to as large a degree 3. As with other regions, the carbon tax affected prices in 2013 and (to a lesser extent) in 2014. 4. Plus we have the aberration (off “old” normal) that is Q2 2016 . However what’s particularly noteworthy in the chart for SA is that, unlike the 4 other regions, prices for Q2 2015 did not re-seat back down at $30/MWh but instead remained stubbornly above. At $45.44/MWh in that quarter, that’s a significant uplift on top of where the other regions were sitting. 1f) Summing up for all regions Taking the trends for Q2 average prices for each region and plotting them all on the same chart, the following is what we see: For our readers, the most important 2 take-aways from this analysis should be: 1. That the outcome for Q2 2016 was truly remarkable ; and 2. That it affects everyone, right across the NEM – and hence readers could surmise that overly simplistic “it was due to … [this one factor]” statements are unlikely to be correct , and could be dangerously misleading. —————— 2) Many, many more prices in the $100’s Q2 2016 pricing was unusual – though I hear the more seasoned reader note that it’s not been unprecedented. To illustrate for everyone, I’ve taken all 4,368 half-hour periods through the quarter (through each of the 18 quarters) and apportioned prices into buckets, depending on the level at which they fell. 18 discrete curves have then been overlaid on a chart for each region, with particular years of interest highlighted. 2a) Distribution of prices in QLD Starting again at the top of the NEM, here’s the chart for Queensland: As was the case for the trended stats (above) we have highlighted the outlier years: 1. The supply-constrained early years in QLD; 2. The drought year of 2007; 3. The two years of carbon tax; and 4. The massive result for Q2 2016 just passed. In this series of charts we can clearly see how astoundingly different the outcome was this year – the only similar quarter was the one in drought-plagued 2007 (a year where there was a clear, systemic, NEM-wide causal factor). Of key interest, here, is a much higher incidence of prices above $100/MWh . 1. If we exclude 2007 (898 half-hours) and 2016, the incidence for all (16) other years ranged from a low of 1 half-hour (2011) to a high of 305 half-hours (in 2000, as can be seen), with the next highest being 124 half-hours (in 2002). 2. Clearly the result in 2016 is staggering – with 775 half-hours (cumulatively, more than 16 days) seeing prices above $100/MWh, well above what historically we’ve been accustomed to seeing as “normal” levels of pricing. Unlike 2007 however, in the case of 2016 it’s not factually correct to point to a single, NEM-wide, “smoking gun” – though that has not stopped a diverse range of different people trying to simplify, but ending up being overly simplistic. 2b) Distribution of prices in NSW Progressing further south, it should probably not surprise readers (by now) that we see a similar pattern: Again we see 2007 and 2016 standing out like sore thumbs. The carbon tax years of 2012 and 2013 receive mentions – and I’ve left the note for 2000 on there, with respect to supply shortage in neighbouring (though not really connected at the time) QLD to prompt the comparison with the chart above. 2c) Distribution of prices in VIC Moving into Victoria, we see the same picture: Likewise we see 2007 and 2016 as the standouts – with 2012 and 2013 receiving mentions because of the curves clearly shifted to the left by virtue of the $20-something/MWh cost imposed by the fixed price on carbon. I’ve also noted slightly elevated levels in 2008, partially as a result of hang-over from the drought of 2007. 2d) Distribution of prices in TAS Down in Tasmania, we see a somewhat different picture – though still with similarities: The local issues of 2016 push the incidence of prices above $100/MWh to almost 50% of all trading periods over the entire quarter. 2e) Distribution of prices in SA Finally, we land at South Australia: As noted above, the effect of the drought in 2007 was not felt as severely in SA (hence not as large an uplift in average price for the quarter). In contrast, however, the variety of factors affecting Q2 2016 prices were felt more severely in South Australia than in the other mainland regions – with more than 1,000 trading periods seeing prices above $100/MWh. 2f) Summing up, for all regions Selecting just the incidence of prices above $100/MWh for each region and trending over time, we see the following summary: This chart also highlights how staggering the results of Q2 2016 are , compared with historical norms. Only the 2007 drought year was anything like it – and that was for a transient cause (though perhaps one that will occur more frequently in a climate-changed world). Once again it does beg the question – was Q2 2016 a short-lived excursion, or a more systemic change in pricing patterns? —————— In a complex system (such as the NEM) it’s highly likely that, with most events, there are a number of contributing factors. It’s also possible, given the NEM is a market, that the actions of multiple actors (each with their own discrete commercial/other drivers) play a role in influencing outcomes. This energy transition upon which we have embarked in Australia (and elsewhere around the world) is multi-faceted . Though an interested observer might not deduce this from the volume of electronic ink produced, perhaps, it is far broader (in my view) than just being about achieving any particular percentage deployment of renewables. It’s far broader, as well, than pursuing a zero-emissions trajectory. There are many moving parts involving customer awareness and empowerment, technology change, new business models, asset renewal, changing ideology and other facets. However we don’t have time to get ourselves sucked into that rabbit hole, so instead of taking the route backwards from “Outcomes” to “Causes”, instead I’ve been puzzling about the bridge forwards between “Outcomes” and “Implications”. In particular, given our keen interest in demand response , I have been puzzling about the implications of these changing pricing patterns for the energy users who provide a valuable service to the market through demand response services. These are some of the same major energy users (a number of whom are our clients ) who have historically used Australia’s low cost and abundant energy supplies as a source of competitive advantage in their own global markets. As time allows, I will post more thoughts specifically on these implications over at www.DemandResponse.com.au … PS – on 22nd July, I posted this article here about “Possible implications for Demand Response, flowing from Q2 pricing patterns changes?”",

    "title": "The opacity of distributed, small-scale solar PV output",
    "date": "17-06-2016 09:16:00 AM",
    "content": "The rise of intermittent generation supplies being injected into Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) has brought some different versions of the same challenges that have been facing electricity system operators since the first networks were built 100 years ago. There are many talking about these issues. For instance, I noticed this article from Matt Rennie at EY about the looming challenges for system operators. Matt talks about the “invisibility of distributed energy” and the growing challenges that this is likely to present in future. This is currently an issue with distributed, small-scale solar PV, and will increasingly be a challenge (probably a more difficult one) with injections and withdrawals from distributed storage. Today I’m posting some comments on the invisibility opacity of distributed solar PV . 1) Comparing different estimation methods We should start by noting that no-one actually KNOWS , in aggregate, how much small-scale solar PV systems are injecting into the NEM (or indeed in any grid). Aggregating data in real time (or even delayed) to provide clarity about injections seems like the type of internet-of-things + Big Data problem that would have technology companies clamouring over themselves to attack. However, what business problem would they actually be solving? Today in the NEM there are at least two different methods in use to ESTIMATE aggregate output from the growing number of small-scale PV systems across the NEM: 1a) The ARENA-funded APVI method As noted on the “Solar Map” project page , ARENA provided $443,238 of funding (75% of the project total) such that the APVI could develop these very useful solar mapping tools and, particularly of interest to us and others, this view of live solar data . The first incarnation of this live map showed data by state, with a worthy enhancement being the provision of an added layer of detail – down to 2-digit postcode level. My understanding of the methodology used by the APVI in the generation of their estimates amounts to the following: (i) Sample some of the self-reported small-scale PV output data at PVoutput.org (this release implies a sample size of “more than” 5,500 PV systems – which is relatively small, given more than 1,000,000 systems installed Australia-wide, but better than nothing); (ii) Aggregated output for a state is then converted to a capacity factor by using the self-reported capacity of the systems being sampled; and (iii) This capacity factor is then extrapolated up using what the Clean Energy Regulator knows of the installed capacity of solar PV in a state/region (a somewhat delayed metric, but again better than nothing). Of course there are a number of assumptions made in this method – as there are in any estimation method. Whilst others might want to argue the finer points about the validity of the method, we’ve been much keener to be pragmatic and incorporate the data to help increase awareness and understanding, where we can. Given other recent developments, we grabbed about a week’s worth of history of this data (we’ve been building an internal record for possible* later use) and trended as follows: As we can see, solar output’s been highest in the middle of the day, is highest in Queensland (most sunshine, and most PV panels), and is also very subject right across the NEM to coincident weather patterns (i.e. the above implies, worryingly, not as much diversity as might have been hoped for – though perhaps this is partly a result of the sampling method?) Readers should note that we technically don’t have permission* to publish analysis like this, but are doing so in the interests of sharing some observations to assist in broader understanding of this particular challenge that could become more significant moving forwards. * the permission we have from the APVI extends only to the inclusion of up to 24 hours of history in products like NEM-Watch (more on this below). 1b) AEMO’s new method The mid-year release of AEMO’s MMS contains a number of interesting new data sets which we will be incorporating into a range of our products. Today we want to highlight the “ROOFTOP_PV_ACTUAL” data field. Unlike the name implies, unfortunately, it seems this data is not an ACTUAL sum of but is, instead, another ESTIMATE . We know that it’s created using a method that is slightly different than the APVI method because the quick eyeball comparison we did with the chart included below shows mostly similarities – but also some non-negligible differences (the AEMO method, for instance, seems to produce higher peaks): A quick scan of the AEMO website did not reveal any details of the method used, but I did pop a quick question into the AEMO. From what the AEMO explained to me: 1) There is, indeed, a difference in the method used by AEMO compared to the (competing?) ARENA-funded APVI method. 2) The AEMO will publish more details on their website later (there is none there now). When this has happened, if I remember, I will add a relevant link below as a comment – or perhaps one of our readers at the AEMO or elsewhere might do so in case I forget? 1c) Do you know of other methods in use? As a company focused on aggregating data, delivering it to clients, and making it understandable, we’re always on the lookout for different sources of data. It’s possible that there are other reasonable methods in use out there that we don’t know about. If so, we’d ask that you please let us know? 2) Accessing this data in our software We’re pleased to announce that we have now incorporated both of these two different data sets into our software, as follows: 2a) Real time solar PV estimates, from APVI, in NEM-Watch Regular WattClarity readers and others will know that we’ve been pleased to be able to incorporate the APVI’s estimates for aggregated small-scale PV output into our NEM-Watch entry-level market dashboard since the release of v10 early in 2015 . Here’s a recent capture highlighting the APVI data: Around the same time as doing this, we also expanded the breadth of the NEM-Watch service by introducing our first NEM-Watch Widget, the Live Generation-by-Fuel-Type mix hosted on the RenewEconomy website , and at a growing number of other locations as well who’ve chosen to embed the widget at no charge: This data set, and the widget as well, have certainly struck a chord – with a steady stream of congrats coming in since that time, some of which has been highlighted here . We also continue to receive a steady stream of feature requests with respect to the widget, some of which we have already addressed. Some of the requests/suggestions have been to do with historical data – we’ve been (disappointingly) unable to help these people as we would like, by incorporating the historical small-scale solar PV output estimates into our NEM-Review (trending, slicing & dicing) product. I understand that there were historical reasons why we were not originally granted permission to include historical data in this way – but, I must admit, I struggle to continue to rationalise this (now a year-and-a-half since we incorporated live data into NEM-Watch , and two-and-a-half years since the APVI map went live), especially in the light of ARENA’s strong knowledge-sharing ethos . It’s frustrating to know that our diverse range of customers have been denied the opportunity to gain insights into the nature of distributed rooftop PV that we looked to do early in 2015. It’s also unfortunate to say that we’d basically given up on that idea, given the time-lag. Surely this was not what ARENA had in mind in provision of such a large funding amount, coupled with their keen interest in knowledge sharing? 2b) Historical solar PV estimates, from AEMO, in NEM-Review Thankfully, the recent mid-year release at the AEMO has helped us over that hurdle. For various reasons to do with the APVI estimate, and the AEMO estimate, we’re not including the AEMO data in our real-time dashboards. However we are now including this into our NEM-Review historical “slicing and dicing” tool : Existing clients will see that the data has already been flowing through for a few weeks (AEMO has not yet back-published much historical data, but at least in NEM-Review you’ll be able to start trending data from May onwards). Clients should select “Metered Generation” not “Target Generation” , as noted on the NEM-Review portal here . We do still have an interest in incorporating the APVI data into NEM-Review in future (clients will probably want to compare between the two different estimates). However the opacity of distributed, small-scale solar PV output has been reduced a little bit, thanks to the AEMO , hence the relative priority for our clients (and hence us) would be lower. 2c) Summing it up, for the NEM For those who think in pictures, we’ve summed the Australian situation up here: Note that this is not the end of the story … 3) What about international data? As I noted here back in April , we’re searching for similar estimates of small-scale solar PV injections for the growing number of grids across the world where we are collecting data. We’re seeking to add these into the internationally-focused LiveGen™ widget we’ve been developing ( here, with the help of RenewEconomy ): If you know of sources for solar generation data (or, indeed, electricity generation data for ANY type of plant, as we want to provide the fullest possible picture) in different parts of the world, please let us know. We continue to strive to make complexity understandable, in the energy sector .",

    "title": "Update on “cost” of Tassie’s energy crisis",
    "date": "03-06-2016 12:38:00 PM",
    "content": "Given I’d previously posted these comments back in March , which had been subsequently picked up by a variety of people in the media, it was no surprise that I fielded a few questions following the release of an Energy Quest claim that the cost of the Tasmanian crisis had reached $560M (quoted in The Age here and probably elsewhere as well). I thought it more efficient to provide an answer as a generally-available post today. Using NEM-Review we can produce this recap of the average daily position of Tasmania from 1st January through until this morning: In terms of the “cost” of the crisis, readers will understand the impossibility of truly answering the question – because of the need to compare “what is” with “what would have been” (where, especially in such an interconnected market as the Australian energy market, it’s impossible to know the truth of “what would have been”). As a general guide, however, one might take the approach I took back in March – ascribing some “uplift” on the cost of energy in the Tasmanian region of the wholesale market over the period, compared to some historical reference. Hence with NEM-Review again we accessed half-hourly spot prices for the 154 days from 1st January 2016 through until the end of the day yesterday, and compared this with prices for a similar* 154 day period in 2015, 2014 and 2014 – revealing the comparison below: * note that the data is for a slightly different 154 day period, date-wise, because of the effect of the leap year. Clearly there is a big difference! Multiplying the half-hourly spot prices by the consumption over that 1/2 hour period in each of the 154 day data sets reveals this comparison: Note that this amount would not include a number of other factors, including the cost (short-term, and long-term) of lost production at the major energy users who agreed to curtail in order to do their bit to conserve precious water supplies (which we termed “ an unwanted form of Demand Response ”) and also the opportunity cost of the energy not consumed by all the other smaller Tasmanian companies and households doing their bit in the same circumstances. Also, the people at Energy Quest will be better placed to understand what flow-on effects might have been felt in the gas market as a result. Hence the $560M number from Energy Quest is larger than the numbers in the table shown above – but not orders of magnitude different. Whatever the cost actually turns out to be (not that anyone will ever know, in totality), it’s significant. As I noted last time, calculating the cost is one (difficult) task – understanding who’s actually incurred the cost and in what proportion is something altogether different (even more difficult).",

    "content": "Firstly, to our very patient competition entrants, please accept my apologies: You have waited a long time since entries were opened through November 2015: (a) you’ve waited through the 4 months of extended summer (with the occasional “I think I’m pretty close!” kind of email or comment); (b) you’ve waited especially patiently through 4 weeks of April, whilst I’ve struggled to find the time to crunch the numbers given everything else we have going on* I’ve not got much time today, so will launch straight into it. Refresher on the 7 competitions, the prizes, and the fine print For those who wish to refresh themselves on these sorts of details, please refer here . Tabulating the 7 winners: Cutting to the chase, winners for each of the 7 competitions are as follows: Competition #1 {The Main Prize} Peak NEM-Wide Demand for the “extended summer” period NEM-wide demand peaked at the level of 32,099MW on Wednesday 13th January 2016 at 16:55 on the day ( as noted here at the time on WattClarity ). The winner of the grand prize this year (the big BBQ) was Stuart Watts at network company Endeavour Energy , with an entry only 7MW above the mark. Competition #2 {Consolation} Peak Queensland Demand for the same period A new all-time record was set for demand in Queensland this summer – with a level of 9,158MW set on Monday 1st February 2016 at 16:45 ( as noted here on WattClarity the day after ).The winner of a handy consolation prize (the portable BBQ) was the QLD local, Michael Day at engineering consulting firm, QGE with an entry an amazing 1MW above! Competition #3 {Consolation} Peak NSW Demand for the same period A reasonable level of peak demand was seen in NSW this summer – with a level of 13,529MW set on 25th February 2016 at 16:35 ( as noted here on WattClarity on the day ). Note the orange colour in the NEM-Watch map snapshot in the article implying still a way to go to reach the level of the all-time maximum, and the discussion in that article of some reasons why.The winner of a handy consolation prize (the portable BBQ) was the NSW local, Stephanie Easton at Infigen Energy with an entry only 2MW above that mark. Competition #4 {Consolation} Peak Victoria Demand for the same period Demand peaked in Victoria just two days prior to the NSW peak, and hence also late in the season – with a level of 9,280MW set on 23rd February 2016 at 16:00 ( as noted here on WattClarity on the day ).The winner of a handy consolation prize (the portable BBQ) was Reinhard Struve in a SA Government Department with an entry only 1MW below! Competition #5 {Consolation} Peak South Australia Demand for the same period Peak demand arrived in the lead-up to Christmas for South Australia this summer – with a level of 2,948MW set on 17th December 2015 at 17:05 (an event we missed at the time). One of the occasions where demand peaks in SA don’t correspond to demand peaks in Victoria as much as my gut feel says they used to (due to the significant overlay of wind output in SA complicating old heuristics).The winner of a handy consolation prize (the portable BBQ) was Reinhard Struve in a SA Government Department with an entry only 2MW above! We’ll be asking Reinhard what he wants to do with his 2 portable BBQs. Competition #6 {Consolation} Peak Tasmania Demand for the same period Peak demand arrived early for Tasmania this summer (both early in the day, and also early in the season) – with a level of 1,323.8MW on Tuesday 3rd December 2015 at 06:35 (yes, we had to go down to decimal points here).The winner of a handy consolation prize (the portable BBQ) was Elijah Pack at AEMO with an entry only 1.8MW off the mark – and also only 0.4MW closer than the next closest entry (from another of our very keen forecasters)! Competition #7{Consolation} Peak Aggregate NEM-Wide Wind Production for the same period Peak wind generation surprised on the low-side this summer: (1) The peak level was lower than I was expecting; and (2) The peak level was also much lower than all except one of our competition entrants were expecting. The peak level was only 2,069MW and was set on Tuesday 1st December 2015 at 09:45 (i.e. it only just squeezed into “summer”). The winner of a handy consolation prize (the portable BBQ) was Patrick Booth at consulting firm, Energetics with an entry that was way below this level (but still closer than all the other entrants who had guessed massively over the actual level of the peak)! We will shortly be in touch with all 6 winners (Reinhard twice!) in order to arrange for delivery of your nice prizes. A big thank-you once again to the many people who entered (and also waited very patiently for the summer to work its way through, and for me to find the time in April to run the numbers. Other analysis to come As time permits, I will look in more detail at each of the 7 metrics in order to update the analysis done 12 months ago for the end of the 2014-15 summer. Long-time readers would know that it’s a topic I am intensely curious about, as it is part-and-parcel of questions (like this one ) about where the electricity sector is headed over the longer term. Questions to ponder include: (1) How are the times of peak demand transitioning outside of sunlight hours, even in summer (and what does that mean for the future with increasing volumes of PV – including ramp rate of demand); (2) Has the variability of wind output changed in some way – why was I (and all of our entrants) surprised as such a low peak output? However with a very busy May ahead, don’t hold your breath for it all to be done (i.e. 7 pieces or more) any time soon… A few other things we have on My excuse for not having got to the competition yet is that we’ve a number of irons in the fire in different areas. We’re continuing to invest heavily in the ongoing development of both existing products, and new ones to be added to our suite – all focused on aspects of making complexity understandable in the energy sector . If you would like to discuss any of these (or other initiatives) please give me a buzz (+61 7 3368 4064). That’s all for now, folks!",

    "title": "What happens when energy is free?",
    "date": "07-04-2016 10:49:00 AM",
    "content": "Recently I was asked by Ben Potter at the Australian Financial Review about the “free energy” prediction of others (including software industry luminary Mike Cannon-Brookes) leading to the news article noted here . As I noted to Ben at the time (as quoted in the article) it is something we’ve been puzzling about for some time, with a number of questions buzzing around collectively in our broader organisation – including what our role might be if such a future should arrive. I’m interested in speaking with people who are also asking the same question ( call me on +61 7 3368 4064 ). For some of our readers, the following thought framework might be useful… Q1) What Technology? First point is not really a question but a statement – in our minds, we’re thinking about Distributed Solar and Storage (though for our purposes in answering the headline question of the article , it does not really matter – and we don’t really care, given we’re technology agnostic ). It is one reason, for instance, why we’ve started tracking the live generation mix for an expanding number of locations in our evolving LiveGen™ widget available here . We’re keen for your input on that one! Q2) What’s the Total Cost of Energy Delivered? As our knowledgeable readers will know, there are several components that go together in making up the cost of energy delivered in this future “free energy” world – here’s some brief thoughts on each of them: 2a) Cost of Operations Let’s start by noting something that should be fairly well accepted – that the short-run marginal cost of generating electricity from an installed panel is close to $0/MWh. It’s not exactly $0/MWh (as there are costs associated with maintaining the panels, with metering the output and with receiving the non-existent revenue, etc), but it’s close enough to zero that we’ll assume that it’s the case. 2b) Capital Cost We’ve all, by now, seen the charts plotting on log scale the declining costs of solar panels (and of storage), and which various commentators have used to extrapolate into the future to guesstimate what the cost might be at some precise point in the future. We’ve all also seen a number of commentaries by various people purporting to either support, or refute (or ignore) these forecasts. Our role is not to get into the detail of which is right, and which is wrong (as all forecasts will prove to be wrong, by definition). I have made the general observation, however, that there seem to be two different types of perspectives here to be aware of: (i) people with an energy-sector background and focus (which includes us, and also include many in the “new energy” space) tend to seem to obsess about a particular point in time where this Distributed Solar + Storage scenario achieves notional “Grid Parity” pricing point; whereas (ii) people with a software industry background and focus (which also includes us) seem to be keen to extrapolate from experience in the IT sector to look past this “Grid Parity” point and see that if the trajectory continues, the capital cost will become low enough as to be effectively $0/MW installed. … hence, I presume, the initial comment about “zero cost energy” that prompted the call from the FinReview. 2c) Cost of Matching Supply and Demand across Time One of the shortcomings of comparing calculations of Levelised Cost of Energy (LCoE) is that such comparisons are not really apples-to-apples comparisons across technology types. Some methods of electricity generation are controllable, and some are not and electricity consumption is not fixed – hence there’s a cost of matching supply and demand over time, which uncontrollable generation sources should be loaded with for a true apples-to-apples comparison. (i) As we started to explore here, transient Demand Response is not going to be anywhere near sufficient enough to achieve this on its own right across the grid in a 100% solar+wind scenario. (ii) However massive, routine load shifting , facilitated by large amounts of distributed storage, could well do – but this introduces another technology element for which there is currently significant capital cost, and non-negligible inherited operating cost (e.g. in terms of energy lost through imperfect efficiency). For argument sake, in this Distributed Solar + Storage Scenario (notwithstanding these questions posed about its dispatch ), we’re assuming that distributed storage will also drop close to zero in capital cost – hence meaning a scenario in which cost of energy generated, and matched to demand, is zero. 2d) Cost of Delivery Given our up-front assumption of a Distributed Solar + Storage Scenario unfolding, we also see an important ancillary benefit in that the cost of delivery of this power is assumed (in this scenario) to be virtually zero as well. Note that such a scenario (i.e. the disappearance of the grid) would not be without its challenges – some of which would be quite significant (and which are also outside the scope of this thought exercise). Given we have conveniently already assumed that the capital cost of solar and storage have both, at this point, dropped to virtually nil, we can assume that there’s no cost in over-building to ensure sufficient local surplus of each at each consumption node across (what used to be) the National Electricity Market Let’s conclude this second question by noting that it may be possible (though our readership will have a diverse range of views about how probable it is) that the cost of energy delivered from our solar + storage scenario might drop down close to zero …. at some point in the future. Q3) What’s the Total Price of Energy Delivered? It’s possible (given the right assumptions) that the total cost of energy delivered might drop to zero – it’s more likely that the total price of energy delivered to the (some, or all?) end consumer might drop to zero. There’s a number of factors to consider in this distinction, which could be summed up by posing the question “ Which parties would have an interest in subsidising the cost of energy delivered, such that the end-user pays nothing for the energy delivered? ” 3a) Societal subsidies Without re-entering the rabbit hole of the debate about who’s subsidies are larger on a $/MWh basis, readers will acknowledge that the price the owner of a solar panel receives for their energy generated is currently affected by current subsidies, a situation that looks set to remain for some years to come. Personally I know I’m a significant beneficiary of some very generous subsidies (and very grateful for receiving them as noted back in January 2014 ). Under some scenarios, it is possible that the current level of subsidy provided to installers of solar PV might remain the same into the future – and under other scenarios (such as if it became accepted that roll-out of PV needed to be accelerated) the level of subsidy might even increase. When coupled with the fact that the raw cost of solar PV is declining, if we assume that the layering of subsidised support will at least continue at current levels we can understand that the direct cost (to the consumer) of the subsidised panels will be continue to be below the declining unit cost of production – hence meaning capital cost of solar paid by the end user would approach zero sooner than would be the case if unsubsidised. This lower cost might lead to higher volume sales and so drive down the cost curve, hence accelerating the transition … (economists amongst our readers might care to comment). The above assumes the continuation of some form of subsidy at some sort of societal level. This scenario seems plausible – given the history , the concerns about climate change, and given the “distributed solar/storage owners are voters ” political argument (witnessed, for instance, in the very effective grassroots campaign orchestrated by the Australian Solar Council and others that resulted in the RET Review quickly deciding that the SRES was sacrosanct). In addition, there’s another scenario that we’ve been pondering… 3b) Corporate subsidies We’ve been wondering under what conditions there might emerge a corporate entity (or more than one) that sees a commercial interest in subsidising a massive deployment of distributed solar + storage such that the energy user effectively pays NIL for the energy delivered. On first brush, our readers might think that’s a crazy idea – but then again… … we’ve already seen some big retailer tout a “free power weekends” or something of the sort – perhaps there is a reason (i.e. a new business model, a new way to make back their investment) why they might extend that to a “free power all the time” sort of offer. This might be partially backed by a declining cost of solar PV, and partially backed by some other commercial benefit. What might that be, we wonder… We could not help but note that some kind of pre-release launch of a particular electric vehicle being greeted by some consumers as akin to the launch of the Beatles lost album, or the second coming of the Messiah, or (after a bit of a wait) a Western Bulldogs flag … … with the volume of investment funds apparently heading for the energy sector (looking for a home, given other sectors at the dogs) it would seem that there will be a few half-crazy ideas out there that will find the funds to soar – or fade into oblivion. Q4) What would it be like, if it turns out to be (even close to) true? This is the most important question we need to be asking ourselves. Restating from above, we’re striving to remain technology neutral , and not get ourselves bogged down in discussion about factors that are really external to our core focus – which is making complexity understandable in the energy sector . If it were to be true (that distributed solar + storage) massively wins the day, this would map to what the CSIRO described as the “Leaving the Grid” scenario in its Future Grid studies for the Energy Network Association (and others?) – or perhaps, if supply and demand are not quite balanced locally, a “Rise of the Prosumer” : Under these scenarios (i.e. where the centralised worlds of “Set and forget” and even “Renewables thrive” don’t prevail), we’re asking ourselves what would result… 4a) Massive Stranded Investments would result Should such a scenario emerge (or even just in part) what’s odds-on is that there will be massive write-offs of stranded investments . (i) Written off would be all those investments in “big bad coal” and “out-of-touch nuclear” that a number of people on the green/left have been lobbying for for a decade or more. No tears for them, perhaps. (ii) Written off also would be massive stranded investments in transmission and distribution network assets . Only yesterday I read these comments published on the other side of the country noting that the top of the market (in terms of a time to cash in on regulated asset base) might be now for the still Government-owned Powerlink business (and I would caution that this is only one scenario). Perhaps not many tears, either, from the green/left on this one. (iii) Also caught up in the transition, however would be the value of all centralised large-scale generation assets – such as large-scale solar and large-scale wind , yesterday’s darlings all effectively stranded under this local supply scenario – should it emerge. (iv) Additionally it should also be noted that collateral damage would also include other projects focused on scenarios such as (centralised) “renewables thrive” scenarios in the CSIRO diagram above – such as the ARENA-funded AREMI project , which would also turn into a white elephant (at a $3,180,000 project value, small bikkies in the scheme of things – though a personal hit for the people who were associated with the project). (v) Finally (and closer to home) there are obviously questions for us about what might happen to our current “old energy” business , and the revenues attached to that, should such a future scenario evolve. Should such a scenario emerge, it’s fair to say that there would be oodles of pain felt very broadly … … but let’s move past all of these as “transitional adjustments” and think more about what that future might actually look like… 4b) Local dispatch would reign supreme Under such a scenario, what role for a “National Electricity Market” and all the associated infrastructure? That’s one question we have been thinking through (as, I understand, have others at AEMO and AEMC, etc…) With Localised Solar, Localised Storage and Localised Demand dominating, it seems plausible that what would be most in demand would be some form of simple dispatch algorithm – something even simpler than the Reposit system given a big plug on this Catalyst show a few weeks ago . What might this be? 4c) What other business models & business needs would emerge? Something to ponder … Q5) What would it mean for us? … as noted to the AFR (and quoted here) this is what we’ve been puzzling about , as part of our scenario analysis for a business that’s been operating in the energy sector for 16 years and which has established some wins over the period. If such a scenario should emerge, we’d like to have thought it through, and done some preparation (just one of a number of “game change” scenarios we’re exploring) If you’d like to help us explore this question ( and can avoid getting bogged in the detail of whether such a transition will , or should happen, or by when ), I’d like to hear from you. Please call +61 7 3368 4064 . Of course, for our other readers, we look forward to posting observations, commentary and other insights on WattClarity over the coming 16 years as the energy market continues its transition – whichever of the 4 broad scenarios described in the CSIRO image above emerges.",

    "title": "Some thoughts on the shaky state of Tassie electricity supply",
    "date": "10-03-2016 09:21:00 AM",
    "content": "If we picture Australia’s National Electricity Market as a 5-legged stool, various stakeholders have perceived different problems with at least three wobbly legs (QLD, SA and TAS) over this extended summer period. I apologize to those WattClarity readers who have been asking for our comment on each of these regions. Guest author Mike Williams has commented on both South Australia ( here and here ) and Queensland ( here ), whilst I do endeavour to put together my own perspectives when time allows. (This week, in spurts,) I’ve tried to recap the situation in Tasmania. It’s a region where I expect there will be a few white knuckles, getting whiter by the day, with the evolving dilemma about ongoing electricity supplies. We’ve grown sadly accustomed to seeing our NEM-Watch dashboards looking something like the following over far too many weeks: I’ve annotated the image to draw attention to a number of the significant developments – some are discussed below (as much as time has allowed). 1) Factors at play in the crisis A number of variables are contributing to, or arising from, the current crisis in Tasmania. Here are some of them: 1a) Basslink cable fault On 22nd December 2015, notice was provided (by Hydro Tasmania and Basslink and AEMO ) of a fault in the Basslink cable. This fault occurred mid-afternoon on Sunday 20th December. Since that time we’ve seen the following updates: 20th Dec 2015 Fault occurred at 15:03 AEDT, according to the AEMO notice linked above. This note also states: ”At the time of the incident, approximately 254 megawatts from four large industrial customers within Tasmania were disconnected under the Frequency Control Special Protection Scheme, which protects the broader Tasmanian network. This load was restored within 30 minutes” That loss of load was a temporary glitch, and one that is understandable given the size of the link relative to the size of the load in the region. Something to keep in mind moving forwards as the generation mix changes across the NEM as a result of changing technological, economic and social drivers – especially if dependence on major transmission lines increases. 22nd Dec 2015 Notice of fault (as above) 14th January Basslink provided this notice identifying the steps that had already been taken to locate the fault. At that time, a return-to-service date of 19th March was estimated, as a result of which AEMO noted no forecast electricity supply shortfalls . 27th January Basslink noted the initial cable inspection did not reveal obvious impact damage . 12th February Basslink noted the difficulty in pin-pointing the location of the fault. 25th February Basslink reported here that there appears to be no external impact damage visible . 8th March 2016 Basslink provided this media statement outlining that a milestone in the repair process had been reached, with the likely site of the damage found and hence a decision made to cut the cable. One the same day the AFR notes that this probably means the crisis will continue till at least June. The Australian, on the other hand , is not so sure on an end date. Prior to the fault developing we see (in the annotated image of daily flows over Basslink produced in NEM-Review ) that Basslink had been running pretty much flat-out from 1st October 2015, sending power from the mainland south over the interconnector into Tasmania until the time at which all flow ceased with the fault: With winter being the typical inflow period in Tasmania, it’s understandable that there would be more exports (shown in green) through winter but winding down through September – notwithstanding the questions (below) about whether it would not have been more prudent to keep storages at a higher level. 1b) Hydro storage levels drop Hydro storage levels were low prior to the outage of Basslink (which is why Basslink flows were running hard south for months beforehand). Without Basslink, then, they are plunging faster – with the NEM-Watch image above showing them at 17% rounded to the nearest whole number. On 3rd March I noted this article in the AFR “Hydro Tasmania: big users ask why it sold power to mainland ahead of crisis” that contains (for those who can access AFR online or have access to the print issue on the day) a good image showing 10 years of hydro output and rainfall. I don’t have time to re-create a similar one here with our internal records so would refer readers to that one. In response, I noted several references (including this one on 1st March in the Australian ) about an early-start to cloud seeding operations to try to promote more rain. An additional cost of $100,000 is noted. 1c) An unwelcome form of Demand Response It’s been noted in various media outlets that the biggest energy users are helping to conserve precious water supplies by agreeing to some substantial reductions in electricity consumption. The Premier, in this statement yesterday , notes: “Through Hydro Tasmania, we have continued discussions with each of the major energy users. A number of our major energy users have presented commercial proposals to Hydro Tasmania for load reduction to assist in managing the situation and several have now been agreed to Hydro Tasmania has also agreed to commercial terms with a number of major industrials for voluntary load reductions. The total load reduction as of the 7March 2016 was equivalent to 115 MW (noting that it will peak at approximately 150 MW during the week of the Norske Skog paper machine shut down). We are advised that these reductions will not impact permanent jobs at these companies and will not jeopardise the long term variability of these businesses in Tasmania. ” Examples I have seen in the press include: (i) The Bell Bay Aluminium Smelter is reported to have reduced its output by 32-40MW (agreement noted on 4th February by Hydro Tasmania and Bell Bay Aluminium along with the Premier ) and more recently (7th March) reported here as even facing closure (and hence job losses ) if the crisis worsens. (ii) Separately it was noted that the Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Company (TEMCO) had also agreed to voluntarily reduce a component of its electricity demand – on 14th January in the Examiner it was reported as 30MW (note that this will be a factor – though not the only one – in the job losses flagged in articles such as this in the ABC on 17th February ). (iii) On 1st March Hydro Tasmania noted that Norske Skog had agreed to reduce its consumption by approximately 43MW at its Boyer Paper Mill. (iv) I did see some press mentions of the zinc plant in Hobart operated by Nyrstar, but can’t find them currently. (v) It is likely that there are others who have also been tapped on the shoulder to ramp back consumption – though this would quickly become a matter of diminishing returns given the relative size of other energy users. I’ve used our NEM-Review software to compose this comparison of average Daily demand levels in Tasmania over a number of “extended summer” periods (December-March): As we can see, the effect of the longer-term demand response evident with the large energy users scaling back operations in the past couple of weeks – though I do note that this appears to have started happening from 1st March – a little later than I had inferred from the announcements above. It’s also showing a reduction in Scheduled Demand that is higher than expected, given the announced curtailments above. My suspicion is that this is due to the operation of the first of the bunch of small, distributed diesel generators operating “behind the meter” to lower Scheduled Demand (in the same way as I noted yesterday how small-scale solar PV works ). This article from 7th March in the Australian (saying that some of these small plants are operating this week) seems to corroborate my suspicion. With respect to electricity consumption in Tasmania, readers should keep this prior analysis (including Shaun’s comment at the bottom) in mind in attribution of differences in demand from year-to-year. 1d) Restart of Bell Bay Gas Plant As noted at numerous places in the media, one of the steps taken to keep the lights on in Tasmania has been to re-start operations at the Tamar Valley site in the north of the state. With the assistance of NEM-Review , I’ve put this longer-term trend together so readers can understand the history of fossil-fuelled generation on the Bell Bay & Tamar Valley sites: As noted in the chart, I’d posted ( here and then here ) in October 2013 about a hiatus at operations at Tamar Valley which, as we can see from the chart, returned to service from December 2013 through till May 2014 before turning off more “permanently”. As an interesting and very topical footnote, I see in this release from the Premier that “the Government has withdrawn the approval given to Hydro Tasmania to seek expressions of interest for the sale of the CCGT. That sale is now completely off the table.” The Premier also notes that the Rolls Royce “Trent” unit (in Tamar Valley Peaker) is expected to be ready for service by April. 1e) Fast-track installation of Diesel Generators There have been several updates from Hydro Tasmania (and hence echoed elsewhere in the media) about the plans to install 200MW of diesel generators in the state. (i) This note on 29th January indicated that the first 24MW being delivered. (ii) This note indicated that the expectation (on 15th February) was that 100MW would be operational by the end of March whilst another 100MW would be in place by the end of April. In line with this we’ve fielded a number of calls wondering whether viewers would be able to see the output of these gensets added into our NEM-Watch Widget (sponsored by RenewEconomy, and showing up at an increasing number of places across the web). We’d very much like this to be the case, but it depends on whether AEMO publishes metered generation data from the plant. It may be that, in the rush to get them installed, it is not possible to have that data published into the Market Management System in time (there are numerous small-scale generators which AEMO only “sees” as netting off Scheduled Demand – hence this is a possible, indeed likely, scenario for these ones as well ). 1f) Solar boost considered, but apparently discounted? With it clearly being a position in which any megawatt is a necessary megawatt with the supply/demand balance severely strained it was not a surprise to read that the possibility of another round of solar incentives, in the form of a feed-in-tariff, is being considered . However yesterday’s article seemed to imply that this idea was not going to fly. 1g) Another interconnection link to the mainland I remember seeing this one around over a longer period of time in different guises. For instance, it was included as a component of the hypothetical “NEMLink” concept in the AEMO’s 2010 issue of the National Transmission Network Development Plan (NTNDP) , as shown in the illustration here: More recently, the plan was (I believe) to run the cable only 1/2 as far (in approximate terms) and connect King Island to Victoria and not to Tasmania to support the “TasWind” project . I believe that the logic was that the storage potential in the Tasmanian hydro systems would make it unnecessary to pay for a link twice as long (i.e. connect Tasmania to King Island). However in October 2014 Hydro Tasmania ceased exploratory work, finding that the project was not feasible due to a number of factors . I noted this article in the Oz “Tasmania seeks federal funds for second Bass Strait Link”, back on 11th Feb , claiming that the state was planning to ask Canberra for a $1b contribution towards getting a second link up and running. It’s no surprise that this possibility is being discussed in the current heat of the moment. It’s more uncertain how serious these discussions will be when the crisis is over and the true cost is known, weighted by probability, and compared to the cost of building a duplicate line. PS on 10th March = One of our readers has pointed us to this article from 7th March in the Advocate “Energy crisis fuels push for wind farm” as something that will interest some of our readers. 1h) Higher prices (for all?) This crisis is having a cost. The NEM-Watch snapshot above shows spot price in Tasmania up at $235/MWh for the five-minute dispatch interval captured in the snapshot, but this has not been unusual (the average price for Q1, thus far, is currently sitting above $150/MWh). In this article, the AFR notes claims that the crisis will cost $100M for the Tasmanian economy. I’m not sure where that number came from (but if we assume an uplift on spot prices of $100/MWh above “normal” multiplied by average consumption of 1000MW across Q1, this equates to $216M added wholesale cost). Whatever the number, it’s big. The Premier noted on Tuesday that the Government is marking down the expected dividend from Hydro Tasmania on the assumption that increased costs of electricity supply won’t be fully recovered from energy users (though the notice did not say by how much). It seems likely that no-one can know, now, with the crisis still unfolding – and with the return of Basslink, and the return of rains, both a little uncertain. What does seem certain is that there will be cost impacts for a number of Tasmanians. One of our friends in Tasmania, Marc White of Goanna Energy Consulting, is quoted here as noting that an irrigator client of theirs has paid 35% (or $50,000) more per year under a new contract – though details were not provided as to how much of this has been due to the crisis, and how much due to other (pre-existing) factors. 2) Finger pointing underway Many will understand that the vast majority of people with a direct role to play in electricity supply throughout Tasmania are knuckling down to do what they can to keep the lights on, and reduce the extent and duration of the crisis. The time for performing retrospectives will come later, when Basslink is back online (and hopefully it has rained). However that has not stopped the finger pointing exercise from starting already. 2a) About Basslink, the Manufacturers, and the cable As much as I can tell from the reading that I have done, there’s still no cause known for the outage – i.e. it does not seem like it was something external (e.g. like a wayward ship anchor, or the like), but it’s still uncertain as to what the cause was. Given this, it’s not possible to know what will ensue in terms of allocating responsibility (or some might wish to apportion blame). 2b) About Hydro Tasmania and storage levels In the interests of completeness, I have listed two areas in which questions will probably be asked when the finger pointing really gets underway: (i) Did the bonus revenue occurring during the 24 months of the Carbon Tax skew hydro management? The carbon tax started in July 2012 and ran through until June 2014. During this time, Hydro Tasmania effectively earned what some might see as “windfall profits” from having its zero-carbon commodity valued more highly, in relative terms, without seeing any adjustment on the cost side of the P&L. I posted about this back in July 2012 in the early days of the carbon tax (though note that output levels then were also influenced – significantly – by problems at Yallourn) and I think I probably commented about this late in 2014, when the effects were starting to wind off. This article on 11th February in the Australian included this argument. On 3rd March, I saw that the AFR included this article “Hydro Tasmania and the Apple Isle’s energy crisis” – in which I particularly noted Brian Morris’ comments on this question. The article notes: “Some say this weakened Tasmania’s energy security. Morris says it was a rational strategy, and the dams were still about a third full – the long-term average – at the end.” Brian is head-honcho of the Energy & Sustainability unit at Schneider Electric and is currently also moonlighting as Chairman of the Energy Users Association of Australia . (ii) Should management of the hydro reserve have been more conservative during winter 2015? I’ve also seen questions raised about whether Tasmania’s hydro reserves should have been more conservatively managed in the months leading up to the outage of Basslink. For instance on 3rd March I noted this article in the AFR “Hydro Tasmania: big users ask why it sold power to mainland ahead of crisis” outlining concerns some have expressed about why Basslink was not used more consistently through 2015 to import power into Tasmania and so conserve (much more precious, now) hydro reserves. In hindsight, it is always easier for us to say that such an approach should have been taken – as we’re in the midst of a deterministic scenario today (i.e. we know that Basslink is out). Putting ourselves back in the picture of 6 or 12 months ago, it was a probabilistic scenario instead (i.e. and one with an assessed low probability that Basslink might have had an outage, a reasonable assumption given the history of the link). When the dust settles, people might re-consider the probability assumed for such an event – and/or the risk ascribed to high consequence, but low probability events. 2c) About the Energy Adequacy Projections Another interesting question is the extent to which such a possibility (albeit low probability) might have been flagged in the AEMO’s “Energy Adequacy Projection (EAAP)” publications . My recollection is that the requirement for these was introduced following the more widespread drought of 2007 and had been updated on a 3-monthly basis since that time – I note that the most recent update (December 2015) contains the following: “The December 2015 EAAP highlights:  Current hydro storage levels in Tasmania are low (26% as at December 2015). Despite this, there is enough storage, local wind generation and import capacity available from Victoria to cover forecast electricity consumption if the current El Niño conditions do not dissipate over the first quarter of 2016.  Hydro inflows used in the EAAP cover drought conditions until the onset of anticipated seasonal rainfall. This is consistent with Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) predictions that the current El Niño event that has lowered hydro storage, is expected to peak January 2016, and is then forecast to decline through the first quarter of 2016 .  As a response to the El Niño, Hydro Tasmania is conserving its hydro storage, and so the state has been relying more on imported energy via Basslink to meet its electricity needs5 . On 17 December, Hydro Tasmania committed to returning 208 MW of gas-fired generation to service in Tasmania in January 2016, providing alternative energy supplies for the state.  On 20 December 2015, a fault on Basslink resulted in the separation of Tasmania from the rest of the NEM. At the time this report was published, the expected return to service date for Basslink was unknown. AEMO has assessed energy supply adequacy (including a scenario where Basslink remains out of service for the entire summer 2016 period) and projects sufficient energy supplies in both Tasmania and Victoria. ” As much as I could tell in only a quick scan, the report does not seem to consider what would unfold if Basslink were to be out for a longer period. Given that the outage has occurred (hence is top of mind for many), it does raise questions about what might be done to identify other (low-probability but high-consequence) risk scenarios in future as the distribution of generation plant changes under various low-carbon generation options. 2d) About the Government and Generation Options On this point there’s the possibility (or likelihood) of finger pointing in both temporal directions – both (i) in terms of what should have been done in the past to better equip Tasmania to weather a crisis like this (pardon the pun), and (ii) what should be done in the future (especially on the assumption that rainfall patterns are systemically changing as part of a changed climate). Who will the fingers be pointed at – the Government, Hydro Tasmania (as the only generator) or “the Market”? Yesterday I noted this article on RenewEconomy referencing this statement from the Premier talking about steps being looked at to increase fossil fuel back-up generation. PS on 10th March = I note that Jack Gilding of the Tasmanian Renewable Energy Alliance has (today) provided these comments here . 3) Looking forward to learning more on Tuesday 22nd March in Hobart The Energy User’s Association of Australia is hosting a morning session on the Tassie energy system in Hobart on Tuesday 22nd Hobart . I would expect that, with the dramas unfolding in Tasmania, it will be very well attended. I am certainly looking forward to learning more ( no promises about having the time to post any more on WattClarity afterwards, however).",

    "date": "09-03-2016 08:55:00 AM",
    "content": "On Tuesday we noted that Ketan had shared a post originally made on Thursday 25th February about some high demand experienced in NSW (well, moderately high , being highest experienced through traditional summer – but still well below the all-time maximum as noted in the article ): Ketan found our article after completing his own analysis here . Seeing the reference reminded me that I’d promised to add a bit more to my WattClarity post, but had been distracted by a number of other things over the ensuing 2-week period (for which I apologise). I don’t have much time today, but did want to add in this snapshot taken from NEM-Watch yesterday evening, which shows a stacked & trended generation-by-fuel-type chart across the whole of the NEM: (a) so the same data as shown in the NEM-Watch Widget on RenewEconomy , but just trended over a 24 hour period; (b) I’d like to show you more history but our agreement with the APVI currently allows us to only display 24 hours of history in the installed NEM-Watch product. I’ve annotated the chart to highlight the trend of demand both with, and without, small-scale solar PV. As an approximation, we can subtract small-scale PV output off gross consumption (AEMO calls this Native Demand) to produce the remainder, Scheduled Demand (i.e. what AEMO dispatches to, to keep the lights on): As highlighted in this chart, solar PV has had two effects on peak demand on this particular day: 1) Solar PV has reduced the peak Scheduled Demand below what it would have otherwise been; and 2) Solar PV has also shifted the time of peak Scheduled Demand to later in the day. From what I have seen, these two effects are fairly typical with reference to a summer demand shape (the winter demand shape has been evening peaking for as long as I have been watching, hence is a different beast entirely). What this implies is that there’s a law of diminishing returns at play here – whilst a certain number of MW of installed capacity of solar PV (to date) has reduced peak demand by some amount, doubling that capacity (all else being equal) would result in less than a doubling of the reduction in peak demand. This is because solar PV output tails off rapidly through the afternoon (especially if new panels continue to be installed facing north). There would come a point (though we’re not there yet on the particular day shown) when peak demand is shifted outside of daylight hours and, if so, more solar will do nothing – in the absence of some form of load-shifting – to further reduce peak demand. Part of “the Duck Curve” issue. Hence caution should be adopted when using (simplistic) “rules of thumb” – like assuming that more of the same will provide a linearly increasing value in terms of peak demand reduction.",

    "title": "Highest electricity demand in NSW so far this summer seen today",
    "date": "25-02-2016 04:22:00 PM",
    "content": "True to yesterday’s prediction (from the AEMO, not me!) we saw NSW demand rise higher today than on any other day this summer period (higher than the 12,845MW seen on 21st January ). Summer’s only a few days left to run, but there is a weekend in the way, so it’s likely that this will be the final level – except, of course, if you are one of our eager competition entrants waiting to see if you win a BBQ given we declared that the competition would run over “extended summer” till the end of March. (A) What was today’s peak demand in NSW (highest so far this summer)? Seen here is the NEM-Watch snapshot from 14:50 NEM time (so 15:50 in Sydney) showing the dispatch target demand published by AEMO rising past 13,000MW for the first time this summer (13,034MW in this snapshot, so into the orange zone): Forty minutes later (at 15:30) we see that this demand had climbed another 253MW to be at 13,287MW , as seen in this second snapshot: At least at the time of posting today , the highest point the demand reached was 13,529MW at 16:25 NEM time (when measured on a dispatch target basis ). This had been building through the afternoon. See, from the snapshots above, how the demand in NSW did reach the orange zone but was still some way (1,200MW or so) below the all-time maximum demand – i.e. the red zone (on the 1st February 2011, which we recorded on WattClarity back at the time , showing the age of both WattClarity and NEM-Watch ). (B) Why today’s peak NSW demand was well below the all-time maximum? There are, no doubt, a long list of factors contributing to why today’s peak demand in NSW was well below the all-time maximum (despite the stinking hot weather). If you have particular ideas as to other factors that have contributed, I would invite you to comment below this post (or let me know offline, if you prefer) . The following is list to get you going: Factor #1) Heat not as bad as it might have been It was hot today in NSW (or at least it looked that way, from the vantage point of a cooler Brisbane) – and it also looked somewhat warm in some parts of the state yesterday . However it was not as bad as it might have been (it’s never that bad ☺) 1a) Only 35 or so in Sydney today First observation is that we’ve seen hotter days in Sydney – such as on the day above in 2011 , and in this stinker in January 2013 . That day in Sydney back in 2013 showed 45 degrees in Sydney (how much higher would the demand have been today if temperatures had been 10 degrees higher?!) 1b) Yesterday was not too bad It’s been commonly understood in the industry for many years that electricity demand varies depending on how many consecutive days of abnormal heat have been experienced. This is both a result of: (a) thermal properties of habitable areas , in terms of keeping heat out, and also a result of (b) psychological factors (which might be colloquially termed the “screw this, it’s hot!” factor when people, who have resisted the first day or two, crank the air-conditioners to the max). Factor #2) Small-scale solar PV behind the meter Australia’s aptly named “solarcoaster” has delivered a bumpy ride to the growing solar niche/wedge, but also left a number of implications for the broader electricity supply sector – not the least of which is the ongoing production from small-scale solar operating behind house-hold meters, which the AEMO does not see in real time and hence has the effect of netting off the “Scheduled Demand” the AEMO focuses on in dispatching the market to keep all of our lights on (at least for the 99.99% of consumers who have not gone off-grid entirely). With the permission of the Australian PV Institute, since early 2015 we’ve been pleased to include a trend of the past 24 hours in the installed version of NEM-Watch for our clients (also seen on an instantaneous basis in our more public – i.e. free – NEM-watch Widget on RenewEconomy ). This has helped to complete the picture of the total supply mix. As highlighted in the first image above, solar injections behind the meter have clearly had a significant impact on reducing demand below where it might have otherwise been ( something like 700MW at its peak output today). On solar PV’s effect in reducing peak electricity demand Will come back to this …. Better late than never, please see these comments here added on 9th March . Factor #3) Closure of Kurri Kurri Aluminium Smelter Another major factor was the closure of the Kurri Kurri aluminium smelter. If I had more time today I’d dig up some real numbers, but my receding memory is telling me that this was of the order of 350MW consumption , base-load (perhaps a reader can correct?) Factor #4) Other factors Some years ago I compiled this list of factors contributing to the general pattern we’d observed of declining electricity demand . However that’s all I have time for today, folks – please feel free to comment below, or offline directly (tel +61 7 3368 4064). Would be especially good if you could link it to some numbers to indicate a scale of the effect!",

    "title": "Hot weather (and LNG gas demand) drives Queensland electricity demand to a new all-time peak",
    "date": "02-02-2016 12:35:00 PM",
    "content": "At the end of last summer, I completed some analysis of summer demand levels for each region – and, with particular reference to this analysis for Queensland , noted that summer 2015-16 was expected to see high demand levels indeed (resulting from a step-change in industrial demand with upstream electric compression at the gas fields for LNG export), especially if an El Nino summer eventuated. On Thursday last week I posted this forewarning of what has indeed unfolded yesterday and today… Yesterday we saw the Queensland scheduled demand (dispatch target) rise above 9,000MW for the first time, driving Queensland well and truly into the red zone within our NEM-Watch dashboard display: I did not have time to post about this yesterday, but I did manage to post the image from 16:55 on Twitter and LinkedIn . As shown in this snapshot, the highest the demand reached yesterday was 9158MW at 16:45, just 10 minutes before this snapshot was taken. Last week the forecast was for a higher demand on Tuesday than on Monday (in line with the higher temperatures forecast) so this morning I was keen to check AEMO’s predispatch forecast in NEM-Watch , which showed an expectation that demand would rise to above 9,300MW as shown in this snapshot from 05:50 this morning: I was also interested to see, in flipping through the Courier Mail this morning , that Energex was quoted saying the demand in the Energex zone was still 260MW below the all-time record for the south-east corner: “Energex’s record for summer peak demand is 4760 megawatts, which was recorded in the summer of 2009/2010. Yesterday’s electricity demand stood at 4500 at 5pm,” a spokesman said. “Tuesday’s demand could go even higher and could set a new record for electricity use, due to the expected higher temperature forecast for the day,” he said.” This helps to indicate the significance of the upstream gas compression pushing the state-wide consumption figure through the roof (also keeping in mind that the APVI estimated that there was 219MW being delivered to the grid at 16:55 from the 1000MW+ of installed small-scale solar PV in the state, hence reducing scheduled demand by that amount – outputs also seen in NEM-Watch). From 05:50 this morning the demand climbed into the 7000MW range at 06:45 (7015MW) and into the 8000MW range at 08:50 (8010MW), and continued to climb – as early as 10:40 the demand was up at 8,707MW with Brisbane temperature showing 35 humid degrees in NEM-Watch : In comparison between the NSW region (where demand has grown from 7,550MW to 8,752MW over the same period – so by 1,202MW) we see Queensland demand has grown from 6,383MW to 8,707MW in the same period (by 2,324MW or almost twice as fast). At 11:00 we saw a (surprisingly rare, this summer so far) spike up to near the market price cap, with demand still higher at 8,758MW: As one indication (albeit imperfect) of the scale of demand response active in the Queensland region , we see that the scheduled demand target for 11:05 has dropped from 8,758MW to 8,413MW (a not-insignificant drop of 345MW given that demand has been otherwise climbing through the morning): It was just after midday (12:05) when the demand made it above 9,000MW for the second day in a row (and the second time ever ) – as shown in this NEM-Watch snapshot: More startling is the fact that AEMO’s predispatch forecast for peak demand later today has been growing through the day – with an expectation that the peak will be a little above 9,600MW around 16:30 and 17:00 (with cloud cover keeping the humidity in, but dampening the effect of solar). If this comes to fruition, this would smash the record set just yesterday by almost 500MW! I have afternoon commitments which might mean I can’t return to this topic till much later – rather than miss the publishing deadline I’ll make this live now and then (I hope) return to it later today…",

    "title": "Next Step for Smart Grid in Australia",
    "date": "29-01-2016 02:37:00 PM",
    "content": "The overwhelming majority of Australians are able to enjoy a consistently reliable and safe source of electricity, whether they be consuming at day or at night, at home or at work. The importance of ensuring that the supply of electricity remains robust and secure cannot be overstated; Australia’s economic growth and its desire to encourage innovative technology and manufacturing industries is largely dependent on it. Prior to 2010, the National Electricity Network (NEM) experienced steady growth in peak demand and energy consumption. The strain set to be placed on the network by the forecasted increase in peak demand and energy consumption, warranted continual high growth in capital expenditure, not only on the repair and maintenance of existing infrastructure, but also on the expansion of network capacity in growth areas to meet anticipated peak demand growth. In addition, license conditions set by state and national regulators were raised to higher standards of safety and reliability over the same period, particularly in NSW. As such, capital investment was required to not only meet the needs of a growing population but also the increasingly rigorous license standards. These additional capital costs were paid for by consumers through significantly more expensive electricity bills. This in turn opened consumer’s eyes to the costs they were supporting for the provision of electricity services. The negative price-elasticity of demand kicked in, as consumers became more cost conscious, driving usage efficiency measures and exploration of alternative technologies. The growth in electricity peak demand and energy consumption by consumers has tapered over the last 4-5 years after this prolonged period of growth. The fall resulted from a perfect storm of: the adoption of more efficient home appliances and lighting; widespread insulation and rooftop PV installation; improved heating, cooling and water efficiency in new homes; in-home demand-side management systems, and; a shift in the broader economy from manufacturing to service industries. The tapering of current and forecasted consumer electricity demand has allowed network service providers to delay augmentation capital investment that was scheduled for the tail end of the recent regulatory period, and reduce augmentation for the following regulatory period. However, the requirements of maintaining and replacing elements of an ageing network subject to higher risks of failure remains, even as the number of consumers continues to grow while average consumption reduces. The fact that consumers have become more sensitive to prices and price elasticity in this utility sector does matter. In addition, as competitive alternatives to network delivery of electricity have become more affordable (i.e. distributed generation from PV on households and small businesses), and consumer uptake of efficient appliances increases, continued downwards pressure on network energy throughput appears more likely. Figure 1 Annual energy forecasts for the NEM Source: AEMO Forecasting Report 2015 Figure 1 illustrates that the current year-on-year forecasts in the AEMO’s forecasts. The marginal increase under each scenario incorporates some growth from the LNG plant openings in Gladstone, though there are now expectations that this will be somewhat offset by higher than expected uptake of solar PV and storage systems. There have been a number of initiatives introduced by the government in order to keep final costs for consumers at a reasonable level. For example, feed in tariffs encourage consumers to install rooftop solar capacity, reducing their demand on the electricity network. However, peak solar output rarely lines up with peak network demand, which is often the most accurate measure in assessing the need for capital expenditure on the network. Moreover, the nature of the solar subsidies and feed in tariffs has resulted in households who did not install solar subsidizing those who did. The large upfront costs of solar panels effectively acted as a barrier for entry for households lacking in disposable income. As such, the feed in scheme and PV subsidies had the undesired effect of facilitating a transfer of wealth from the lower to the middle and upper classes; a distinctly uneconomic outcome in this case. By the time these policies wind up, publications by the Grattan Institute estimate that households and businesses that have not installed solar PV will have subsidised Australians who have to the tune of $14 billion. This is comprised of subsidies from the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES), feed-in and network tariff structures (see Figure 2). Figure 2 Aggregate net cross-subsidies from electricity consumers without solar PV to consumers with solar PV, $2015 Source: Sundown, sunrise: how Australia can finally get solar power right, Grattan Institute A fresh approach to distributed generation and storage is necessary. The industry could implement dynamic tariffs (time-of-use tariffs) to shift some peak load and flatten peaks in electricity demand, leading to a decrease in the costs of running the electricity transmission and distribution networks. Modelling described in the Smart Grid, Smart City report drafted by Arup suggested introducing mandatory dynamic tariffs for some consumers as a mechanism for reducing the cross-subsidisation effects within the current tariff structure. Such initiatives are being supported by changes in the NEM rules being pursued by the AEMC, but further jurisdictional support may be needed to drive such change. The Smart Grid, Smart City report also showed that dynamic tariffs would accelerate the adoption of storage technologies . However, in a sign of the rate of development in storage technologies since the report’s publication in July 2014, the modelling suggested that under business as usual (BAU) conditions storage technologies would not become economically viable in the foreseeable future, and that even with dynamic tariffs there would be no economic deployment of distributed storage technology until 2024. The report did comment on the importance of education within the Australian context. Although dynamic tariffs are commonplace in many developed countries, Australian residents are largely unsure of firstly what dynamic tariffs are, and more importantly what the impact on their bottom line would be. While Victoria mandated the roll-out of the advance metering infrastructure (AMI, and some would say ‘not so’ smart meters), other states are relying on competitive rollout of smart meters, which will in effect be paid for by the consumers considering new tariff arrangements, and therefore will be part of their economic decision. In Victoria, as this cost is effectively sunk, albeit already paid for in consumer’s bills, it will likely not factor into consumers decisions of new tariff adoption. A combination of climate, policies and disposable wealth has resulted in Australia being the world-leader in PV penetration (refer Figure 3). This also means that – though the policies that got Australia to this stage might not have been ideal – we are now in a position to shape the PV and storage discussion given the strong synergy that PV has with energy storage, whether sized as distributed, embedded or grid-connected. Figure 3 Proportion of households with PV Source: Clean Energy Regulator; Energy Information Administration; Atlasole; French Ministry for Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy’ Bundesverband Solarwirtschaft; Spanish Photovoltaic Association (UNEF); Eurostat; Electricity Gas Australia 2015, UK Department of Energy and Climate Change The Smart Grid, Smart City report discussed the reluctance of network operators to invest in new smart grid capital developments given the lower than expected demand levels and the perceived short term impact on future pricing. Given this, the report suggests that has a role to play in encouraging targeted research and development funding for network operators in areas that could deliver the most significant economic benefits to consumers through more efficient network operation. But the AER is firmly of the view that “ new investment in innovative technology should be supported by its own business case and not through the regulatory asset base ” to avoid these research and development costs flowing into increased network prices. This suggests new investment in innovation for increasing deployment of renewables into the grid will need to be funded from the business’ equity and will be ‘at risk’ to competition. Therefore, it should, in-principle, also be considered a . The growth in smart grid technologies, particularly storage mechanisms, since July 2014 indicates that network operators would have easier access to developed smart grid technology which is trial-ready. However, in recent decisions the AER has shown its hand in significantly cutting capital and operational expense levels for network service providers (NSPs), without the financial support for the use of these new technologies. Consequently, NSPs may be reticent to approach the AER for research and development funding, and the AER unlikely to reverse its initial classification of these investments as non-regulated. Australian electricity networks are in a state of flux. Regardless of access to AER funding, it is becoming readily apparent to network operators that to remain financially viable in the long-run requires investment in new technologies. It would appear that widespread adoption of dynamic tariffs in the short term, would likely not only reduce the cross subsidies of the current spread of renewable support schemes but would likely also encourage uptake of smart grid technologies by customers as well as NSPs. While this would lead towards a more economically efficient outcome, there would be winners and losers in the consumer space as cross-subsidies are unwound. The next 12 months should see NSPs running further trials of storage technologies and dynamic tariffs under different business models to find how they can remain viable in an environment where their regulator is keenly watching short-term prices. The timing for when conditions become economically attractive enough for consumers to adopt their own storage technologies is a more open question. Australian energy retailers are already teaming up with battery manufacturers to offer consumers and small businesses . In November 2015, the Alternative Technology Association found ( in this report ) that these packages are not yet economically viable in the Australian market, and are not likely to be so until 2020. That is not to say there will not be any market at all for these small-scale storage solutions. There will always be early adopters and outlier groups where existing battery technology is viable. Indeed retail offerings using these technologies are appearing in the market place now and early adopters are taking these offerings, even though the economics may at this point be marginal for many Australian consumers. However, while the first movers on the supply side are the retailers, it is the reluctant NSPs who are seen as the sharks of the Australian energy market, who are likely to suffocate if they don’t get moving with offerings of their own which allow them to leverage network efficiency gains from these new technology bundles. What should also be noted is that forecasting energy and peak demand in Australia has recently been fraught with uncertainty. What for years had been a steady and determined annual increase in electricity demand first flattened out before starting to reverse altogether across much of Australia. This had been forecast by approximately no one in the energy market industry. The new expectation of a return to growth, has yet to be proved out in publication of up-to-date data. The regulatory incentives from the network price setting arrangements, underpinned by what later would be seen in changed circumstances as a generous capex determination by the AER, led to the NSW DNSPs to make investment decisions in network capacity resulting in the high network prices we see today as that extra capital is recovered. As recently as this year, the AEMO significantly increased its forecast for PV generation from its 2014 report, as prices of PV technology dropped by more than most had anticipated. See Figure 4 for comparison. Figure 4 Comparison of rooftop PV forecasts Source: AEMO 2015 electricity forecast Key conclusions: • There is a clear positive economic case for immediate deployment of dynamic tariffs in Australia (requiring smart meter infrastructure); • If dynamic tariffs (and smart meter adoption) are voluntary, not all customers will adopt the offer, and the broader economic benefits will be muted; • Without dynamic tariffs customers will be presented with a strong financial incentive to install larger distributed generation systems (both PV and battery storage), which will hinder rather than encourage better network efficiency; • If block (or flat) tariffs (either inclining, declining or bundled in nature) are maintained in Australia it is unlikely that distributed storage will be widely deployed due to a lack of market based financial pricing incentives for consumers; • NSPs need to run further trails of storage technologies and dynamic tariffs under different business models, to better understand how they can improve network management efficiency and hence reduce costs for a more sustainable network service provision; • If policy makers prefer market mechanisms to determine the speed and diversity of the take-up of more PV (or renewable) generation and storage technologies (including distributed, embedded and grid connected solutions), governments need to ensure their decisions do not distort the market place, leading to uneconomic or inefficient solutions; • At the same time governments and NSPs will need to be aware that those segments in society constrained by affordability issues, will need to be supported through existing mechanisms as new technology becomes more widely adopted; and • With the potential of PV installation being followed by storage adoption as a significant grid disrupter, the industry stakeholders should be careful about overreliance on peak demand and energy consumption forecasts. Current forecasts, while improving in a dynamic environment, appear to continually lag actual outcomes, previously on the downside, and potentially now on the upside.

    "content": "Last Thursday I noted how the NSW electricity demand peaked at 12,822MW on a hot summer’s day – prior to a cool change (and other factors, as one of our readers noted) driving a steep reduction in demand. Today we saw another hot day in the Premier State and, as would be expected as air-conditioners crank up, we saw demand for electricity rise as well. This morning in NEM-Watch we saw (at 11:35) the demand yet to hit the 12,000MW mark: The demand in NSW peaked yesterday at 12,634MW (at 16:05) but this level was exceeded earlier today – with this 12,742MW mark at 14:15 : Also in this snapshot we see the NEM-wide demand has risen to 30,010MW – above the 30,000 mark. Fifteen minutes later (at 14:30) we see one of the instances of price activity seen through the day (one of the relatively rare times with no interconnectors bound on the mainland, though with Basslink still out of action): At this point we see NSW demand up at 12,798MW and expect it won’t be too much longer before we see a new peak for summer 2015-16 . Five minutes later (to 14:35), however, we see the demand target drop by a neat 150MW (from 30,251MW down to 30,101MW across the NEM) as a result of what might be price-sensitive demand response ( described here ), along with other factors. As part of this drop, NSW demand has dropped by 140MW to 12,658MW: By 14:50 (15 minutes later) we see NSW demand had recovered to 12,845MW – eclipsing the peak of last week and setting a new mark to beat for the NSW region over the rest of summer: At the time of posting this article (15:30 NEM time) this was the highest the demand had reached – i.e. demand had begun declining in NSW, whilst continuing to climb in QLD. One factor common to this week and last has been “the holiday factor” with schools still out, and businesses not yet back to peak busyness.

Clicking on the Market Notice heading within NEM-Watch opens the full text of the notice in Notepad – with the message saved here for your reference: As noted in this image, an LOR1 notice is the least -severe of the AEMO warnings . However at 12:45 we see AEMO has issued another Market Notice warning of a forecast LOR2 level for later this afternoon (from 14:00 to 15:00 NEM time, so 15:00-16:00 NSW time). This coincides with the real-time warning calculated by NEM-Watch of a low Instantaneous Reserve Plant Margin (IRPM) in the NSW Economic Island (845MW spare, or a margin of only 7% – whereas typically the system is more comfortable above 10%): Given the tightness of the supply/demand balance, it was no surprise to see the occasional price pop up close to the market price cap into the afternoon – such as this example from 13:35 market time: What was more of a surprise was to see the demand flatten off over the prior hour (compared to the morning’s forecast), as noted in the image above. No doubt something to do with the storms progressing through the western areas: However by 13:50 we see that AEMO had issued an “Actual LOR2” Market Notice (from 13:30 market time) warning that available reserves in NSW had dropped below the 2nd warning level (meaning, in simple terms, that a large unit trip would probably result in some loss of load): As it turns out, the NSW demand today peaked 5 minutes before this snapshot – with a level of 12,822MW at 13:45 – thereafter commencing a steep decline as the storm front cooled proceedings markedly, as shown here an hour afterwards in the 14:45 snapshot with demand now 1,550MW lower than today’s peak: Not surprisingly, we see prices have subsided.

As seen in the colour-coded snapshot, demand in QLD has progressed out of the green zone and into orange, despite the efforts of the 500,000 (or so) small-scale solar PV systems injecting into the grid across QLD, and particularly in the south-east corner (as also shown in NEM-Watch ). Scheduled demand would be higher if those injections were not present – another factor which makes the expectations that peak demand in QLD will be more than 9,000MW this summer (for the first time ever) even more significant.

    "date": "27-12-2017 03:42:00 PM",
    "content": "I’ve had a number of conversations with different people over the past couple weeks about the foibles of wind forecasts – all premised on the reality that, as installed capacity of wind farms continues to grow with the RET-induced boom in development currently underway, it’s going to be critically important to improve forecasts of their output over the coming 12 months. Entirely by coincidence, I was watching some major gyrations in aggregate output across all wind farms in South Australia today and thought it worth sharing the following snapshots from the “Forecast Convergence” widget within ez2view to illustrate: As noted on the chart, this widget enables the user to see how AEMO’s successive forecasts have converged on actual outcomes – or, in the case of many half-hours today in the snapshot above, have significantly not converged on actual outcomes (which have proved much more volatile than the forecasts). Frequent readers of WattClarity will remember that I have previously noted how forecasting is a mug’s game . This certainly applies to forecasts of market prices – but increasingly it also applies to forecasts of the lead-in variables that are becoming increasingly difficult to forecast in the increasingly complex NEM – variables such as: 1) Aggregate wind output, like above; 2) Aggregate solar output; and, partly as a result of these two 3) Region level “Scheduled Demand” forecasts. Readers should be under no illusion that the AEMO’s task is easy in this respect – in fact, it seems to me that the AEMO’s task is simultaneously becoming even more difficult in future, AND more critical to the “keeping the lights on” mandate, at reasonable cost. One of the more obvious reasons that prices in SA (and VIC) are high at present is because wind output is relatively low. However what might be less obvious to many (hence has been noted on the second snapshot below) is that one of the factors driving higher prices is the poor level of predictability of output from the wind farms – because there is less certainty of what the wind will deliver, more (other) capability needs to be provided to deal with short-notice swings. It’s already costing real money to energy users that forecasts are not as good as they need to be now – and these costs are sure to escalate in future as the installed capacity of intermittent plant grows. We all should have a keen interest in seeing forecasts like these improve in future – and no-one should be under any simplistic illusion that “the problem is solved”.",

Here’s a snapshot from NEM-Watch v10 this morning: Lest some readers overlook other factors weighing into the low demand across the day, I’ve included this shorter-term trend from NEMreview v7 to highlight the quite low apparent temperatures Victoria saw on Christmas Day – meaning low air-conditioning load, which would have combined with the lower commercial load and the small-scale solar during the afternoon to deliver lower demand levels: In years gone by, it used to be fairly typical that “the night before Christmas” , or the night after, would see lowest point of demand for the year – however in this second trend from NEMreview v7 to below we see that the past coupe of years have seen demand levels lower at other points of time:",

    "title": "Hot weather sees NSW demand at 13,000MW and NEM-wide demand above 31,000MW",
    "date": "19-12-2017 04:18:00 PM",
    "content": "I posted yesterday morning about how the AEMO was forecasting that NSW “Scheduled Demand” today would climb to 13,500MW on a dispatch target basis . As noted yesterday a level of demand up at 13,500MW would be the highest level seen so far this summer, and would be a level exceeded on only 7 occasions in the past, including summer 2016-17. As a company full of data junkies operating in the energy sector, we’ve been using our software tools (like the evergreen NEM-Watch v10 entry-level dashboard ) to keep an eye on how the market has unfolded over the day. Here’s a few snapshots as the day progressed (all times in “NEM time”, so readers should add an hour to convert to Sydney local time with daylight savings): At 12:00 dispatch prices climb for the first time into the red zone In this snapshot we took from NEM-watch in the 12:00 dispatch interval, we see dispatch prices in the NSW+VIC+TAS “Economic Island” jump to the $300/MWh mark for the first time, driven by the climbing demand levels. Both QLD and SA, separately “protected” by more lower-priced generation than could be supplied in their own regions or be exported further, see prices remain below $100/MWh: * we coined the term “Economic Island” years ago to indicate that, though the QLD and SA regions are not electrically separated from NSW+VIC+TAS in this case, they are commercially as no more lower-priced generation can reach into the higher-priced regions because of transmission congestion. At 12:45 the NSW demand climbed past 12,000MW At 12:45 NEM time, we saw the NSW demand climb to 12,039MW. At 14:00 the NEM-wide demand climbed past 30,000MW Perhaps seven our eight years ago, demand levels of 30,000MW were commonplace expectations over summer – not so much these days as a result of the declining demand we’ve seen for whole host of reasons (some good, some not so good). Hence it’s worth noting that the NEM-wide demand climbed past 30,000MW this afternoon – reaching 30,149MW in the 14:00 dispatch interval . At 14:55 the NEM-wide demand climbed past 31,000MW Less than an hour later (in the 14:55 dispatch interval) the demand had climbed another 1,000MW across the NEM (to sit at 31,042MW). This is still 1,000MW below what was forecast on Monday morning to be the demand peak at 17:00 today as shown here (32,280MW forecast on the same basis). At 15:35 the NSW demand climbed past 13,000MW In the 15:35 dispatch interval, we saw the NSW demand climb to 13,003MW – and the NEM-wide demand reached 31,520MW . However the bump above 13,003MW was to be short-lived, as the demand dropped back below 13,000MW immediately after and remained below that mark for a number of dispatch intervals. Here’s a snapshot from the 16:00 dispatch interval which sees NSW demand up at 12,978MW and NEM-wide demand already declining down to 31,111MW: We also see that the NEM-wide demand dropped more sharply. After 16:00 the NSW demand climbed past 13,000MW again (several times) In the 16:05 dispatch interval (five minutes after the snapshot above), the NSW demand popped back up to 13,002MW. That was also short-lived. However, with the daily cycle of solar beginning to reach its late afternoon low ebb, as expected we saw \"Scheduled Demand\" (which is \"consumption\" minus what’s supplied by generation behind the meter/market, like solar) drive back up – reaching 13,044MW in the 16:25 dispatch interva l. Here’s a snapshot of the market 5 minutes later (at 16:30) showing NSW demand at 13,028MW and with the trended NSW generation-by-fuel-type chart focused just on solar (small and large). We can see that the total contribution from solar in the region is down from a peak today of above 1,000MW to a level of about 300MW (keeping in mind that the APVI estimates for small-scale solar are published about 15 minutes slower than the AEMO metered numbers for large-scale solar, hence explaining the offset in this NEM-Watch chart). We also see that the NEM-wide has dropped only slightly to 30,925MW. … perhaps there will be more updates here later If anything particularly noteworthy happens after publication (and we have time) we might post more about it here…",

    "content": "Worth highlighting at this point (using the Forecast Convergence widget in ez2view ) that successive demand forecasts for NSW looking out a week into the future flag what’s currently an increasingly hot weather forecast for NSW late tomorrow afternoon (i.e. Tuesday 19th December at 16:30 NEM time) where demand is currently forecast to peak up above 13,500MW: This would be (if it eventuates) only 1,000MW below the all-time record, which would be a noteworthy outcome given the demand destruction since the peak was previously set in summer 2010-11 (e.g. the closure of Kurri Kurri aluminium smelter), and fresher memories of what happened when demand peaked up above 14,000MW on 10th February 2017 in NSW , with both these extremes seen in this trend from NEMreview v7 : As time permits this summer we’ll post more on WattClarity . PS – a little later on Monday… After a bit of exploration in the web-based “Time-Series Data Viewer” widget within ez2view , I’ve assembled a chart that provides a NEM-wide view of forecast demand for the week ahead, bridging together the P30 predispatch data and also the ST PASA data. It also shows both common measures of demand: 1) What AEMO calls “Scheduled Demand”, which is the measure they have historically used; and 2) Something AEMO publishes that approximates “Operational Demand”, which takes into account demand met by non-scheduled generation. As noted on the chart, forecast for Scheduled Demand later today (NEM-wide) has now dropped below 32,000MW (meaning the cancellation of the LOR1 notices and the drop in prices forecast earlier in predispatch). The forecast for tomorrow is that Scheduled Demand will still rise above 32,000MW NEM-wide. For clients using ez2view , you can access a live updating (and editable) version of this, either: 1) Online in any browser here ; or 2) [COMING A LITTLE LATER] we’ll also have a live updating but non-editable trend chart for “Week-Ahead NEM-Wide Supply & Demand Forecast” in your installed copy of ez2view from the “ez2view explorer” – which you’ll be able to find by searching for “NEM-wide”, for instance .",

    "content": "A quick look at NEM-Watch v10 on Sunday evening revealed something that we don’t see all that often – with relatively high demand forecast for both Victoria and NSW for late on Monday afternoon – as seen here in the snapshot taken at 19:50 NEM time: In this snapshot we’ve recorded the tabular view of demand, focused late in the afternoon tomorrow, where we see that: NEM-wide demand forecast to peak at 32,023MW in the half-hour ending 17:00 NEM time NSW demand forecast to peak at 11,933MW (so about as high as Thursday ended up last week) in the 16:00 trading period – so 17:00 Sydney DST. VIC demand forecast to peak at 8,533MW in the 17:00 trading period, so 18:00 Melbourne DST and an hour later than the NSW peak SA demand forecast to peak up at 2,781MW in the 18:00 trading period, so an hour later still – though 17:30 in Adelaide DST. Much has been said about Hazelwood’s closure earlier from April 2017 , and much more about the reserve capacity that’s been brought on to fill the gap. This trend chart from NEM-Review v6 highlights the two big differences, from last summer to this one: 1) A non-trivial drop in available generation capacity across the NEM (partly a result of the closure, but also because of current outages – and even taking into account some return-to-service of mothballed capacity); and 2) The prospect of a spike to 32,000MW in demand tomorrow , which is well above what we saw in December 2016, and which we saw only a couple times through the whole of last summer.

In comparison, this snapshot from NEM-Watch at 17:50 shows that Scheduled Demand only peaked up at 8,455MW (as dispatch target) in the 16:40 dispatch interval (NEM time) late today in Victoria: What’s more, the price did not rise above $150/MWh at all through the day.

Here’s the same chart from the Forecast Convergence widget in ez2view focused on NSW – in which we can see the continued trend upwards on the forecast for tomorrow afternoon: Someone asked, in response to Monday evening’s post, what might happen to prices as a result. Given that we’re now in the predispatch window we can look at how AEMO’s successive forecasts are trending (again in Forecast Convergence within ez2view ): In this series of overlayed charts, we see that there are forecasts that afternoon prices might reach the cap payout price of $300/MWh – however this was also forecast for this afternoon, and did not eventuate.

    "date": "11-12-2017 08:59:00 PM",
    "content": "The Bureau or Meteorology is forecasting hotter weather for NSW later this week – including temperatures above 40 degrees in Western Sydney as noted here for Penrith: Knowing the strong correlation between temperatures and electricity demand (which is why we were happy to work with Energy Consumer’s Australia in providing the ECA Widget , for instance), I took a look at how AEMO’s successive ST PASA forecasts are looking, using the Forecast Convergence widget within ez2view : We see that the demand forecast for NSW on Thursday is higher than the surrounding days, and has climbed significantly over the past couple hours – but is still 2,000MW below the all-time maximum demand. As highlighted on the image, the peak is forecast to be around 16:00 NEM time (so 17:00 in NSW with daylight savings time). With the hot weather, it’s obviously of interest how the large-scale solar projects are forecasts to contribute through the day, so we had a look at this (as well) through the Forecast Convergence widget in ez2view . In this view, the data combines the two major intermittent generation sources in the NEM (wind and solar, though note that only large-scale solar is taken account of in AEMO forecasts – not the larger contribution from small-scale solar ): As we see in this chart, output from large-scale solar and wind in NSW is forecast to climb from today’s low level to a peak for the week on Thursday, and that the forecast for Thursday is increasing. The time of forecast peak demand (at 16:00 on Thursday) is flagged on this chart – as could be understood, this late in the day (i.e. 17:00 in Sydney with daylight savings) is starting to tail off as discussed here earlier this year . In the third view from the Forecast Convergence widget, we look at the AEMO’s successive forecasts for Surplus Generation and we see that recent runs of the forecast have shown the level dropping (to a low point below zero around 15:30 on the day). Now, to those who might be predisposed to misinterpret these numbers: it does not mean that there won’t be enough generation capacity ; it does mean that NSW will probably be drawing heavily on interconnection with QLD and VIC it also probably means that prices will be quite high , as it should be to signal the supply scarcity. We’ll watch Thursday unfold in real time with great interest (from what will hopefully be a cooler Brisbane). For readers without a licence to one of our products, you can also watch this through the ECA Widget . PS – Victoria and South Australia to see higher demand Wednesday Looking further afield in the data this Tuesday morning, I see AEMO’s successive forecasts for demand in Victoria and South Australia are increasing, so we’ll be watching this as well.",

    "title": "How does frequency regulation help avoid Blackouts?",
    "date": "05-12-2017 12:51:00 PM",
    "content": "Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it. It seems this might apply to power systems engineering as well as other walks of life. It has been over a year since the power system blackout of SA, which was not particularly novel from a technical viewpoint, but the ramifications of which have imposed itself on the body politic of Australia in ever increasing circles like ripples on a pond from a dropped stone – or an impressively sized meteorite. We have had various reviews and reports into the incident itself, the Finkel review into power system reliability, the establishment of the Energy Security Board (ESB) and a rapid roll out of various National Electricity rule (NER) changes. In this article, I am going to concentrate on just one aspect of the SA blackout, which is important – I would say critical – for preventing future similar events. That issue is regulation of system frequency and in particular how it relates to controlling power flows across interconnectors between regions. The graphic above shows that the thermal power station at Torrens Island Power Station (TIPS) was ramping down in load (after initially ramping up) for about 15 minutes prior to the blackout. This (along with the loss of wind farm generation due to system faults) contributed to an increase in flows across the Heywood Interconnector which ultimately tripped due to high power flows. In hindsight this was exactly the wrong thing to do. However all this power station was doing was following its power dispatch set point so it was not any way at fault. It’s dispatch set point is set by the market, and there are two ways this can happen, via the price it bids for energy, and via the price it bids for frequency control ancillary services (FCAS). As it happened on the day in question TIPS elected not to bid for regulation frequency services, and we understand no other generator inside South Australia did either. This means that if the frequency of the system declines (which the graphic shows happened about 2-3 minutes before the event) then corrective action is applied outside of South Australia to raise the system frequency. We can work out which units were involved in applying the correction by looking at their respective outputs. All of them were outside South Australia. Even Tasmania via Basslink was supporting the mainland system frequency – everywhere except where it was needed which was inside South Australia itself. So here’s the crux of the issue: How units are dispatched critically impacts power system security, but currently this is ignored in the design of our regulation FCAS markets. On the day of the SA blackout no units inside SA were participating in the regulation FCAS markets, in fact many units (TIPS in particular) were being dispatched downward by energy market signals. Accordingly we shouldn’t be too surprised that the Heywood Interconnector had little headroom when the tornados rolled across the state knocking down transmission lines. The markets had created a situation which made the state’s power system vulnerable to failure. In discussions with other industry professionals on this subject a few points have been raised which I personally disagree with. I will briefly answer why below: Raised Point 1- There was no frequency issue before the Heywood interconnector tripped because the system was operating within frequency bounds. I disagree – in my view the allowable tolerance on system frequency is too wide and should be tightened. If it were, then tie line control could be easily introduced, which would allow better control of interconnector power flows. Having wide frequency ranges also slows down contingency frequency responses of governor control systems and limits the sensitivity that ‘under frequency’ load shedding schemes can be safely set to. Operating a power system with wide frequency ranges is like driving a car with a loose steering wheel. Raised point 2 – TIPS power output was not changing prior to the SA blackout. I take this statement to mean that over a relatively short time frame the output of TIPS was unchanged. When considering frequency regulation, a longer time frame is more appropriate. As the graphs above clearly show, TIPS was ramping down its power output immediately before the blackout occurred. It should also be noted that TIPS was not the only generation which was changing over this period, in particular some wind generators were also changing their power outputs but in their case it was in response to system faults, not market directions. Both of the statements above miss the point. Just because a power system is operating within designated frequency bounds, does not imply those bounds are appropriate. It is a circular argument to say there is no problem because limits are not being exceeded, and because limits are not being exceeded there is no problem. So how do we avoid similar incidents in the future? I.e. how do we learn from history? The following would go a long way to improving power system security: (1) Regulation FCAS should be divided between regions; with regions at the far ends of the network (South Australia and North Queensland) allocated amounts that ensure the power flows on their critical transmission links are adequately controlled. Currently it is allocated across the mainland purely on bid price. This can lead to situations where some regions have no regulation FCAS enabled. (2) Tie line control should be introduced at weak points on the system to reduce the risk that interconnector flows reach dangerous levels. Currently interconnector flows are free to operate at any level subject to defined constraint equations which can rapidly be overtaken by unforeseen events (such as the trip of several transmission lines). There are many other issues that also need addressing which relate to other aspects of the ancillary services market, but this will take us too far afield from the subject of this article. Future articles will look at contingency FCAS and the workings of the ancillary services market.

However that’s far from the case. This morning we see this ASX Announcement from Genex Power of first revenue from the Kidston Energy Park – so we powered up NEMreview v7 to have a closer look: The first stage of Genex Power’s world-leading Kidston solar and “giant water battery” project began sending electricity to the grid in northern Queensland this morning, from the project’s initial 50MW PV array. That makes it Queensland’s biggest operating solar power plant – at least for a time. Stage two will add another 270MW of solar PV and pumped hydro energy storage capacity of 2000MWh by the time it is completed, in early 2021.

    "title": "Unfortunately no time for a “Best Peak Demand Forecaster” competition for summer 2017-18",
    "date": "03-12-2017 03:57:00 PM",
    "content": "I’ve returned from a week away and am currently trying to wade through emails to ensure the “working week” is as productive as possible. Amongst the emails were a number of questions asking whether we’d be running (what used to be) our regular “Best Peak Demand Forecaster” competition for summer 2017-18. (A) Unfortunately no time to run the competition for summer 2017-18 The short answer to that question is, unfortunately, NO . Given the diverse range of clients we serve in this multi-faceted energy transition , of which summer and Q1 are very critical periods, we need to be fully focused on the job at hand over this period. We just don’t have time to run a competition on the side, unfortunately. (B) The nature of demand is changing – making a singular focus less meaningful I do hope, for some summer in future, we will be able to re-start the competition process. When that occasion arises, we will need to think through some aspects of how the electricity supply sector is changing, in order to ensure that the target of the competition remains relevant. When we first ran the competition ( for summer 2005-06 I think ) the NEM was much “simpler” than it is today – with demand (and in particular peak demand) being clearly the dominant driver of new infrastructure development, and hence cost . It was the case back then that “Scheduled Demand” was a very good proxy for consumption (or “Native Demand”). Neither are so much the case now , in this new world we’re all transitioning to in the energy sector – i.e.: 1) The rate of consumption of energy in electricity at a given point in time (measured in MW) is increasingly very different from the rate of “Scheduled Demand” that the AEMO has to dispatch generators to meet. 2) Because of this, and other factors, peak demand has lost its singular dominance as the main driver of infrastructure development – and hence cost. Given these changes, when we do find the time to revisit and restart our competition, we’ll need to give some thought to the right metric to target. (C) What you might do, to keep an eye on demand this summer As a software company that focuses on “making complexity understandable – so people can make better decisions” , we have developed a number of different representations of electricity demand (and/or consumption) over the years. Some of these are accessible by anyone at no cost – such as these two highlighted here: C1) The “RenewEconomy Widget” Our first widget was first released in 2015 and has been progressively enhanced since that time. We’re currently in the midst of a major upgrade (i.e. re-write) to ensure visibility of both sides of the battery equation. We’ve done this given the general popularity of the Tesla/Neoen “biggest battery in the world” , but also to provide visibility of other types of batteries that have long been operational in the Australian electricity supply sector, as shown in this annotated image of the new widget here: As noted on the image, you can currently access the widget here on the NEMwatch portal here – but it will (when finalised) be rolled out to its main location on RenewEconomy here , and then on a variety of third party websites across the internet (i.e. where people have followed instructions to embed). No charge to view the widget and gain benefit in that way, and also no charge for third parties to embed on their own website (thanks to our sponsor). C2) The “ECA Widget” To follow on from the RenewEconomy, we were also please to work with Energy Consumer’s Australia, who sponsored their own widget designed specifically to highlight the way in which weather patterns (primarily temperature) have a significant level of influence on the amount of electricity consumed in a particular location: As noted on the image, you can access the widget here on the ECA website – but it is also available on a growing number of third party websites (and here on the NEMwatch portal ).

    "title": "AEMC released Final Determination on Five Minute Settlement on 28th November 2017",
    "date": "28-11-2017 06:00:00 PM",
    "content": "This is a back-dated article (published 30th September 2021, just prior to Five Minute Settlement ) to provide some context ———— Following from the Sun Metals rule change request on 4th December 2015 , almost 24 months later the AEMC released this Final Determination into Five Minute Settlement (on 28th November 2017,): In this final determination, the AEMC held that: Five minute settlement will commence on Thursday, 1 July 2021 . This is a transition period of three years and seven months. Five minute settlement is implemented in the NEM by amending the definition of a trading interval from a 30 minute period to a five minute period. Bidding and offering into the NEM, the online dispatch process, settlement, intervention pricing, the calculation of trading amounts, the calculation of the cumulative price threshold, and periodic energy metering are done on a five minute trading interval basis . The provisions applicable to spot price determination are amended so that a spot price is now determined for each five minute trading interval. The spot price is no longer the time-weighted averaging of dispatch prices across a 30 minute timeframe. A new definition of 30 minute period is created to be a 30 minute period ending on the hour or on the half-hour, and comprising six consecutive trading intervals. This new definition is applied to provisions in the national electricity rules (NER) which should continue to operate on a 30 minute basis. For example, in relation to the projected assessment of system adequacy (PASA) processes, AEMO is required to prepare and publish information for each 30 minute period . AEMO is also required to calculate and publish 30 minute spot prices (calculated in the same way that the current spot price is calculated). Types 1, 2 and 3 meters will need to record and provide five minute data from the commencement date of the rule. Type 4 meters at a transmission network connection point or distribution network connection point where the relevant financially responsible Market Participant is a Market Generator or Small Generation Aggregator will need to record and provide five minute data from the commencement date of the rule. The final rule does not require type 4 (other than other than type 4 metering installations at a transmission network connection point or distribution network connection point where the relevant financially responsible Market Participant is a Market Generator or Small Generation Aggregator), type 4A, type 5 and type 6 meters that are already installed to record and provide five minute data at the commencement date. The data from these meters will be profiled to five minute trading intervals by AEMO. From 1 December 2018, all new and replacement type 4 metering installations will need to be capable of recording and providing five minute data. These meters must be configured to record and provide five minute data from 1 December 2022 at the latest. From 1 December 2019, all new and replacement type 4A metering installations will need to be capable of recording and providing five minute data. These meters must be configured to record and provide five minute data from 1 December 2022 at the latest. Existing meters that generate five minute data are prevented from being replaced with a meter of a lower functionality. AEMO can exempt a Metering Provider from complying with the data storage requirements for types 1, 2 and 3 meters and type 4 meters at a transmission network connection point or distribution network connection point where the relevant financially responsible Market Participant is a Market Generator or Small Generation Aggregator installed prior to 1 July 2021 where it is reasonably satisfied that the Metering Provider will be able to otherwise meet the requirements of the NER. During the transition period, NEM participants will update metering (if required) and information technology (IT) systems to implement five minute settlement . It is also expected that most existing hedging contracts will have rolled off and new contracts will accommodate a future implementation of five minute settlement. AEMO will update its systems during this time and is expected to provide a test environment for participants … with our emphasis added. The AEMC Rule Change ‘Five Minute Settlement’ sub-site here provides access to all of the details. This rule change determination promoted a start date of 1st July 2021 … but this was later delayed to 1st October 2021 (as a result of this delay process).",

    "title": "It’s complete baloney to claim that there’s “less than 1%” of peak demand in the NEM that is currently providing Demand Response",
    "date": "25-11-2017 11:26:00 PM",
    "content": "It’s been a busy week this week. Amongst other developments, I noticed this article on Wednesday in EcoGeneration titled “The Rise and Rise of Demand Response” . Being a keen supporter of (and facilitator of) Demand Response in the NEM since around 2002, with a growing number of energy users we support in this manner, I read the article with interest. However I was surprised (and saddened) to see the unnamed author seeming to claim that there was only 1% of peak demand in the NEM in this comment: “Demand response is on the radar. The Australia Institute says demand management will be worth $36 billion by 2025 and increase from 39GW to 144GW, and the International Energy Agency reckons a good benchmark for demand response is about 15% of peak demand. In Australia it is less than 1%.” (A) Sloppy journalism The way the article was written, it did not seem to do much for the credibility of the Australia Institute – with the article seeming to imply that the Australia Institute both: 1) Confused the broader sphere of “demand management” with the narrower sphere of “demand response” ( a subset of demand management, as explained here ); and 2) Seemed to claim that Demand Response (or Demand Management?) would rise from 39GW to 144GW in Australia (which floored me, given that the highest the demand has ever been in the NEM was only 35.5GW on Thursday 29th January 2009 – just before the “Black Saturday” disaster ). However with the benefit of a bit of time later, and digging, I tracked down this article here from Dan Cass at the Australia Institute of July 2017 that seems to show (on page 6) where the author/editor at EcoGeneration had (very sloppily) gained their perspective: Hence it did seem that the major errors in the article came down to sloppiness on the part of the Editor/Author, rather than errors at the Australia Institute. Unfortunately it may well be their brand is tainted by association – I know I had a pretty poor first reaction, and suspect others will have as well…. (B) Tracing back the claim that Demand Response in the NEM is “less than 1% of peak demand” The 1% claim in the article as posted in EcoGeneration on Wednesday ( paragraph copied verbatim above just with the 1% claim highlighted in red ) stuck out like a sore thumb, because we know that it is just plainly wrong (and significantly so). So on Wednesday I added my comment to the LinkedIn feed ( read the full text of the comments here, as they are worth the read ): I notice that now (i.e. Saturday evening, when I finish this post) the 1% claim has been removed with the much vaguer “far lower” as copied here for posterity: As I noted on the image, if the author/editor has retreated from a claim that the level of demand response is “less than 1%” of peak demand, how can they be so sure that the level of demand response in the NEM is “far lower” than the 15% the IEA suggests is a good benchmark? So I returned to the Australia Institute report from July 2017 that they appear to reference. Below the quote referenced above is the following: So it seems that EcoGeneration repeated comments that Australia Institute made, based on claims made in the Finkel Review referencing a “2016 Survey” run by the AEMC. Something seem a little strange in all of this to you? At least we understand where a “less than 1%” metric comes from, then – if the AEMC apparently said that there was only 235MW reported in an (optional?) survey of (a sample of?) energy retailers, at least mathematically that represents less than 1% of peak demand in the NEM. However is it anywhere near an objective truth in the answer to the main question – how much demand response is there in the NEM? Given that I’d come this far, I pressed forward (thankful at least that the Australia Institute had references a particular page (i.e. p152) in the Finkel Review ). Here it is, with the corresponding reference highlighted: Again, thankfully, the Finkel Review references specific pages in the Oakley Greenwood report (which is belatedly copied here) , so I dig further in this noddy game of “pass the parcel”. And, lo and behold, what do we find: Well, it seems the “less than 1%” claim is based on very shaky ground indeed… For only 5 retailers (of 30 or so) provided data on the users they had who had some incentive to provide demand reduction (i.e. one particular method of Demand Response) and reported a total of 235MW – i.e. this was a small sample set, and was only one form of demand response (a sample of a sample). We don’t know who these 5 were, and whether it included retailers we know of who are keenly pursuing Demand Response as one point of differentiation. However it seems to have made its way up the chain above to be represented as a gospel claim of “in Australia it is less than 1%”. Talk about sloppy! In the interests of clarity for the patient reader who’s made it this far, I should note that Lance Hoch of Oakley Greenwood posted this article on the dedicated Demand Response site we host to explain more about their method, and the report . The full Oakley Greenwood report is worth reading, though I did notice a number of errors in a review just now – for instance: This makes us think that Oakey Greenwood probably ended up understating the amount of Demand Response in the NEM – but that’s a moot point anyway, as the references of their report tended to misconstrue what they had actually reported in any case… (C) So, how much Demand Response is there (actually!) in the NEM The truth is, I don’t know. What I do know is that the “less than 1%” is complete baloney – but it’s been a stubborn misconception that I’ve seen all too often. I’ve noted here on the focused demand response site how we help facilitate demand response with a range of energy users . I know the aggregate load of our client base adds up to way more than that 1% amount, and spans all 5 regions. (D) Why is it so frequently understated? I have puzzled about this over the years, as this is not the first time a claim of “there’s no Demand Response in the NEM” has been raised. In my puzzlement, I’ve identified at least four possible causes: D1) Because comparison with international markets are sometimes (often?) apples-to-oranges comparisons Most electricity markets internationally have some form of Capacity Market in place – but the NEM does not, at least for now (though we’ve noted calls for the inclusion of some form of physical capacity market since before 2015 (not without warts) – with both the Generator Reliability Obligation in the Finkel Review and the Reliability Guarantee under the NEG being forms of capacity market). In the absence of a capacity market, a number of the comparisons of the “how much demand response is there?” questions have been apples-vs-oranges comparisons comparing: (a) Internationally, how much demand response capacity receives a capacity payment (incidentally I think this is where the IEA’s 15% mark comes from); with (b) In the NEM, how much demand response people try to deduce has been actually dispatched . D2) Because in the NEM it is opaque – sometimes deliberately so In the NEM, the large energy users we work with pay costs of energy that are a significant share of operating expenses – hence anything they can do to reduce their cost of energy can be something they are (in our experience) be reticent to share with their competitors. Hence if there is some energy-intensive industry in Australia with a couple companies sharing most of the market (there are a few of them!), most or all of them might be operating in some form of similar arrangement, but with each of them not talking too much about it to protect what they see as their own competitive advantage. To operate as a spot-exposed energy user with physical curtailment, the energy user assumes responsibility for managing the risk (and our software can help them with this), but no-one else really needs visibility of what they are doing onsite. D3) Because it’s a subset of different methods of Demand Response A couple years ago, we put together this site with this definition, to help readers understand that there are different methods of demand response . On occasions, however, it seems that others choose to deliberately ignore (or are ignorant of) different methods for energy users reducing consumption in response to some incentive – commercial or otherwise. D4) Because it fits “the NEM is broken” argument that some way to leverage Unfortunately, from time-to-time I’ve come across people (and organisations) who have tried to import business models and perspectives that might work in another electricity market somewhere else and find they don’t work so well here. It seems that, in least some cases, the tendency might be to think “the NEM is broken” when an alternate view might just be that “my imported business model does not work so well here, because the market is different”. (E) We’re not “pro Anything” – besides “pro Objectivity” I’ve noted a number of times that we’re not pro-coal, or pro-renewables. We strive to remain technology agnostic in understanding the complexities and challenges in making this energy transition actually work. One thing we are strongly “pro”, however, is Data, Facts, and Objectivity . That’s the number one reason why the sloppiness of the above train of thinking exposed above . That, and the fact that we feel directly for the many energy users who we know personally are providing different methods of demand response – but whom are dismissed so summarily by certain groups (including some in “the NEM is broken” camp) because the efforts of these energy users don’t fit some preconceived mental model of ( remembering that “models are just models, they are not reality” ). (F) Please do point out any errors in the above (online or offline) As such, please do point out any factual errors I have made in the above – but please do leave any axe you have to grind at the door…",

    "title": "If you increase your consumption of energy at a time when average emissions intensity is low, you’re not necessarily doing a good thing for the environment",
    "date": "25-11-2017 05:23:00 PM",
    "content": "This week many energy eyes were focused on some goings-on in Australia (not the least of which because of the commencement of operations at the “worlds biggest battery” , which surely must be a short-lived title ). Further afield, I did notice this article from the founder of the innovative, internationally-focused Tomorrow visualisation product (a more usable representation of data than our earlier LiveGen project ). Oliver Corradi ’s article was the first one I’d seen from him – and turns out to be only the 5th on the site, so I did not miss as many as I initially thought. Oliver’s post initially came to my attention through snippets like this on social media: I can totally understand the motivation for helping energy users consume energy at “the right time” – after all, we have been helping large energy users in Australia’s east coast grid (the confusingly named “National Electricity Market” make this decision in reverse for more than a decade – i.e. identify when not to consume, to avoid consumption at times of very high spot prices as a large form of Demand Response in the NEM as noted here today as well – LINK TO COME). I also understand that other consumers, making a different value judgement, will be focused on ensuring the emissions intensity of the electricity they consume will be as low as it will possibly be – which has primarily been through procurement processes such as building their own wind and solar power stations ( some results from mine here ). The idea of timing consumption in the spot market However I would just like to add a note of caution – as this is something that others had approaches us about over the years, with their desires based on some mistaken beliefs . With the thought being that Oliver might have also fallen into the trap of the same mistaken beliefs, I read the article fully (and also the others as well – and was happy to see how he wrote back in May about one of the other mistaken beliefs in “No country X did NOT run entirely on wind” (a trap I’ve seen people fall into all to frequently in this energy transition) I particularly appreciate his admonition that “Instead of focussing on how much renewable we produced, let’s focus on how much CO2 we emit… ” – as it’s long been noted that people “manage what they measure” (so do societies) so it is another timely reminder with the toxic debate in Australia about focusing on the right target in the first place. Back to his more recent article, however, I was a bit disappointed to read this particular bit: “Wouldn’t it make sense to build a society where our electric devices consume electricity at the right time? We strongly believe so. As a proof of concept, we collaborated as part of the CITIES project in building a device that would react to changes in carbon intensity .” Whilst we can understand the emotional connection with shifting consumption to when average emissions intensity is low , it is the marginal generation that should be used to drive these decisions – if emissions reduction is the prime driver for a particular consumer. Falling into an all-too-common trap of focusing on averages appears to be what Oliver and his team have done in the “CITIES Project” he references . I don’t have time to go into the details much further here, but consumers who really are driven to reduce their emissions footprint should avoid “vanity metrics” (like average intensity) and instead focus on more practical (though much harder to ascertain!) metrics like the emissions intensity of the next MWh (or kWh) that might be produced if they were to increase their consumption by that next MWh (or kWh) . In practical terms, because solar and wind production is intermittent and near-zero marginal cost, it is almost always on the bottom of the bid stack, so is dispatched first. Hence it will typically be some other type of dispatchable plant that is the one that is being called on to ramp up, or down, to meet change in residual demand – except, perhaps, in rarer cases if the solar or wind production were being curtailed for some form of system/network reasons such as analysed here for South Australia earlier this year . I don’t mean to rain on Oliver’s party, as the company seems to be doing some quite interesting, innovative and worthwhile things. Just want to ensure we’re all doing our bit to raise the level of Energy Literacy ( category and tag ) to address the growing challenges in this energy transition . —————– PS in June 2022 Worth attaching to this article the article ‘Marginal vs average: which one to use in practice?’ Olivier Corradi has written in June 2022 about this topic",

    "date": "25-11-2017 12:29:00 PM",
    "content": "If you’re an energy sector junkie, like me, it would have been hard to have not noticed all the buzz surrounding Tesla’s (and Neoen’s) “worlds biggest battery” closing in on its 100 day construction deadline. I noted about this in yesterday’s post , and there were questions about it at the National Consumer Roundtable on Energy yesterday as well. This morning we noticed it had started its first serious charging and so thought it would be worth posting this trend from NEMreview v7 showing the period of the charge (a couple hours at a rate of about 30MW) on Saturday 25th November: We’ll post more when we have time to catch our breath, but wanted to make this quick post now to mark the occasion. 1) To view in real time In conjunction with the construction process for the battery, we’ve been running our own construction process – updating the different ways that our diverse range of clients can visualise what’s happening with this battery (and others following hot on its heels). Here’s an image of the updated NEMwatch widget, sponsored by RenewEconomy : As noted in the image, for a limited time (whilst we’re finalising the development) we’ve only included it here on the NEMwatch portal . Feedback welcomes on this (note that we’re already aware of some kinks to be ironed out, like some browser compatibility) . 2) To view a trend over time I produced the trend above using our NEMreview v7 application, which has been provided as a pre-release beta to all current v6 clients as noted here. For those (with the appropriate licence) you can view an updated trend of the above here: 1) In NEMreview v7 , simply click here and your browser will launch with an updated view of the chart above . You can start from there and configure however you like. 2) For ez2view users, it’s a different link so click here and your browser will similarly launch – with the widget being launched having differences of updating in real time, and including predispatch pricing. As a quick PS, thought I would also add in this chart from later in the day that shows the battery discharging at a rate of around 30MW for a little over an hour early Saturday evening. An interesting day indeed…",

    "title": "Some simple calculations to help get my head around the scale of the numbers pertaining to Battery Storage",
    "date": "24-11-2017 12:45:00 PM",
    "content": "On 7th November I posted these initial observations about experience with my own solar power station (informed by better data), and then on 20th November followed up with this top-down (NEM-wide) look at daily solar production through 2017 , incorporating both small-scale (i.e. residential) solar PV and the few large scale plant operational in 2017 (most in NSW). In the second post, we explored the significant underlying seasonal variation in solar output NEM-wide (i.e. so already accounting for significant diversity), with an additional daily variation layered on top. Here’s a chart that illustrates both of these: Today (Friday 24th November) I’ve been asked to speak at the National Consumer Roundtable on Energy on the topic of battery storage – and I appreciate the opportunity to be involved. After all, there are very few consumers who actually buy energy just to stick a few joules on the mantelpiece – it’s what each of us do with the energy, as consumers, that is the ultimate reason for all of us to exist in the energy supply sector . Quite a coincidence, as: 1) this week we also saw the release of a detailed (158-page) report titled “The Role of Energy Storage in Australia’s Future Energy Supply Mix”, as we noted here ( worth also reading these comments by David Blowers at the Grattan Institute before taking what’s in that larger report the wrong way…) 2) we’ve also seen the start of a media frenzy with the end of the beginning for the Tesla/Neoen “biggest battery in the world (for now)” at Hornsdale ( our popular “RenewEconomy Widget” is being upgraded to provide this visibility – you can currently see it in beta here , and it will be on other locations a bit later ) Now, astute readers of WattClarity might have clued onto the fact that I prefer to ground any of my thinking in numbers before speaking at events like the above (or posting online, like on WattClarity ). Hence it was logical for me to try to use numbers to understand the scale of the challenge relating to storage we’ll require through this energy transition . The challenge, in doing this with storage, is that there are not yet any real numbers that would point to how storage has operated historically (apart from the 3 existing pumped hydro plant, of course – but for the purpose of this exercise I’ll discount them in today’s discussion). This is one of the reasons why we’ll be watching very closely at the initial operations of the Hornsdale Power Reserve. In the absence of real numbers for historical operations I had to make some up . There, I said it – so let me repeat, to avoid the apoplexy from either end of the Emotion-o-meter . What follows is a hypothetical scenario – so something that, by definition, is almost certain to be wrong. The reason I have done this is to help get my head around the scale of storage that might be required in this future world. I started with an assumption that you’d not use storage to deal with the seasonal variability – it’s too big, in energy volume terms, so would be more cost effectively dealt with a combination of methods (but no “ Magic Wand ” as discussed further here ). Without going down that rabbit hole of working out what that method might be, I reasoned that (whatever the method) it would probably help to have a bit more dependability on the variability of daily solar production within a given month. Stating this another way, I wondered how much storage would be necessary to even out the variability within each month. So I took the data above and calculated the “unders and overs” for each day when referenced back to the average for the month (this was the same chart as shown on the previous post, just with the numbers represented as volume (MWh) over the day, rather than average (MW) rate of charge/discharge): The next step is to add in a cumulative total across the year. Assuming a 0MWh charge amount at the start of 1st January reveals the orange trend line in the chart below (axis on the right): Now obviously a battery can’t have a negative volume of energy stored (we see it drops well below zero in October above), so we need to adjust the starting point to ensure that the stored energy across this 11 months drops no longer than 0MWh over the period. We do this by adding the lowest point in the chart above (37,410MWh) and assume this was already charged as at 1st January: As noted on the image, based on all these assumptions (and there are a few) we’d need 67,728MWh of storage in place to provide the flexibility to (if required) levellise effective solar production for each day of a particular month – which might make the job easier of “that other thing” to deal with the seasonal variation on output. Now my understanding is that we’re at something like 6,000MW of installed solar capacity installed by April 2017 – 5,600MW rooftop and 496MW large scale as noted by Giles in April (which works out an average capacity factor of only 13% from the output numbers shown in the first chart – which seems a little low… ). The same article on RenewEconomy talks of 1.67 million installations (meaning average size by installation of 3,590kW – so a little smaller than my 5kW array, whose size was dictated by the limit of the 44c/kWh FIT). … so I re-read and find that WA and NT are include in Giles’ numbers and I take them off – bringing this back to 4,886MW of rooftop, and still close to 500MW of large solar (which brings the capacity factor up to 15% for 808MW average output across the 11 months in the NEM). Over 1.5 million households (say, knocking a few off for WA and NT), the 67,728MWh of storage “required” equates to a 45kWh per solar installation. Referencing our useful Battery Finder Widget , we find that the Tesla Powerwall 2 has a nominal capacity of 14kWh: I think this implies (if my calculations above are correct) that all of these 1.5 million households would need 3 x Tesla 2 batteries in order to be able to have the effect of evening out the day-to-day “unders and overs” in solar PV output around the monthly average NEM-wide. This makes me think that either: Scenario #1) There is a big flaw in my numbers above (which is entirely plausible as this was done in a rush for a conversation starting shortly); or Scenario #2) If no error, then it would be impractical to assume that this particular scenario could unfold…. [I do apologies for the scatty thinking in the above – I’ve run out of time on this today]",

(A) Trending Solar Production, NEM-wide Powering up NEM-Review v6 , I generated the following trend over 18 months, which happens to be the entire range (see Insight #3 below) where like-for-like data is available for solar PV production (both small-scale and large scale): There’s more discussion below, but there are three things to flag, as highlights: 1) There is a clear seasonal variation in output across the year, which is as we’d expect. It was the scale of the variation that more stood out for me – I’m not sure I expected winter to be as low as 50% of summer ; 2) Given the growth in solar that is occurring, it was expected that we would see year-on-year growth (and that this will continue for the next decade or more). However the lacklustre Oct16-to-Oct17 case flags caution should be applied to implicit assumptions that production must go up with regularity; 3) It also surprised me that the 4 hottest months of the year (at least for 16-17) saw almost identical output , and it would be pure speculation if I was to pose a possible hypothesis as to why. I wonder whether some of our more learned readers might comment on the underlying reasons for the similarity? From the broader trend (above) I’ve zoomed down to average daily output, but only from 1st January 2017 – where we can see both this underlying seasonal variation but also (layered on top) some day-on-day variation in output that is, on a number of visible occasions, quite substantial . On this chart I have flagged (as it sticks out like a sore thumb) the amazingly low output NEM-wide seen on Friday 19th May 2017 (it’s already discussed previously on WattClarity here , with underlying reasons noted here ). In my post on 23rd August, I highlighted that intermittency delivers challenges over several timeframes , flagging the day-to-day transitions as a challenge from a scheduling and operations perspective. In the chart above, I’ve noted how most dips in output tend to be for only a single day – but that there are a couple of occasions where output is down for 2 consecutive days. This is an important observation when thinking through the design for system-wide measures to allow the grid to ride through these dips as penetration of solar continues to climb. Taking the data above a few steps further, I calculated the day-to-day change (increase or decrease) in output and then, to normalise across the year to (I hope!) remove the effect of the seasonal variability, expressed that change (in MW) as a percentage of the average output across the NEM for the month in question. Then, for the 10-and-a-half months shown here, I plotted this distribution curve: Naturally (and, to some extent, sadly) different readers will focus in on the parts of the chart that suit their own pre-set beliefs and perspectives about this multi-faceted energy transition : The Optimist Some extreme optimists would include those at the “loopy left” extreme of the Emotion-o-meter . The Optimist might view the above and note that 87% of the time there is only a small-to-moderate change (i.e. ranging from a 20% decrease to a 20% increase) in production levels from one day to the next. Remembering that this data is the best available data (Insight #3) for NEM-wide production, this seems to show that the variability is less extreme than what one might infer it to be if that person were to be exclusively reading from certain Pessimists. My sense is (though I have not checked) that the variability would be greater if zoomed into a particular region, for instance – because of the reduction in diversity. The Pessimist Some extreme pessimists would include those at the “rabid right” extreme of the Emotion-o-meter . There will also be a sizeable number of readers who will focus in on the outliers and note that there are a non-negligible number of instances where the increase (or decrease) is as great as 50% NEM-wide from one day to the next. Unfortunately, there would be some Optimists who’d not understand, or choose to ignore, the significant challenges these outliers might represent at a macro level as solar PV penetration ramps up to what might be 10x within the next decade or so. Others With a nod to Gary Larsen’s “Four personality types”, there will be other responses to the above, of course… Taking the same daily data across the year, and again normalising each month it’s also worth highlighting that the daily variation (percentage above and below the monthly average output) seems to be fairly consistent across the year: In this chart (like the 3rd one from the top), the 19th May is a significant stand-out. Showing the same data, but in MW terms, shows a picture where the 19th May does not stand out by such a large margin – making us realise that these sorts of reductions (300-400MW average over the day) have occurred a couple of times through this year and that it’s because this is off an already low average for May that it makes it stand out even moreso on 19th May . The fact that these large reductions (300MW-400MW lower, averaged across the day) can happen off such a low base represents a design challenge when building the grid of the future that will operate under all credible scenarios. The fact that (apart from the odd extreme, and the separate challenge of seasonal cycling) there is no significant change in variability through the year of 2017 gives some confidence that there is not an additional challenge to be thrown into the mix. (B) Relating back to my personal experience Finally, drawing this back to a comparable basis with my initial observations about our home solar power station (where the data focused in on October in particular) I’ve re-set the NEM-wide chart above to just show data over the same time period: In the chart copied in at the top of this article, I had highlighted 5 days in October when my own production was low. For comparison purposes, I have flagged them on the chart above to indicate from a NEM-wide perspective – and discuss this below. (C) Summary Insights and Observations In addition to the notes above, here are a number of overall observations: Insight #1) Alignment between micro and macro It does not really surprise that there is some degree of correlation between the micro (my home), and the macro (the grid) at the level of physical output of the PV system(s) – but neither is it a surprise that this correlation is not perfect. What it does bring to mind, as I write this, is the likelihood of declining incremental value as more solar PV is installed because of the correlation. > On the five days noted where my household PV production was low, we see that the NEM-wide solar production was also at average or below over the period. We believe (though have not checked, in these instances) that the average wholesale price of energy on these “low solar” days would be higher than average, as a result of the lower volume of zero marginal cost energy being injected. Of course the implicit assumption here is “all else being equal”, which is often not the case in a multi-variable market. > Conversely, one supposes that the days when my solar was at peak output, the system would also have been seeing higher than average outputs NEM-wide, hence lower than average spot prices. 1a) Corporate PPAs linked with specific large-scale projects In writing this, I wonder what effects this might have with the current push to corporate PPAs linked to the output of some particular solar farm (still located in a single place, albeit one larger than my rooftop). I wonder whether as solar share of production increases and is increasingly relied upon to do a large share of the “spot price suppression” during the periods of good output , (at least on some occasions) periods of low output at a particular site will share a correlation with low output NEM-wide, hence reduced price suppression and hence higher spot prices. My question, then, revolves around the best way for these energy users to hedge these “low solar days” , given that the spot price might be higher on these days as a result of lower solar, system wide? Something for the corporates (and their retailer broker advisors) to keep in mind in structuring the necessary “whole of load” contracting arrangements for a particular energy user. Indeed, with much noise being made about the rapidly declining costs of solar PPAs, at some point the primary focus will need to change to the costs for thee contracting consumers on the low solar days. 1b) Determining a “fair price for solar” for newer system Feed-in-Tariffs At home as noted here I am one of 400,000 or so Queensland residential users enjoying a very, very generous long-dated feed in tariff. Newer installations are not able to enjoy such bounty ( like Jamey, noted here ), with the resultant keen interest in the periodic “fair price for solar” reviews linked to government-mandated minimum feed-in-tariff for newer customers. This correlation of micro with macro production – and hence through to wholesale prices (hence to retail) will also increasingly factor into analysis used to determine this “fair price for solar”. Insight #2) Significant variability, across several timescales I’ve previously flagged that intermittency delivers challenges over several timeframes . In this post, I have further explored the day-to-day variability that is apparent in solar PV even on a NEM-wide basis. On this day-to-day basis, we obviously can’t change the physical capacity installed on the ground, but we can think through ensuring the right market incentives are in place to ensure that other technologies and approaches (see Insight #4 below) are able to address the variability – both: 2a) A large number of day-to-day variations between –20% to +20% in output over the day; and 2b) Rarer variations of up to 50% (up or down) from one day to the next. In the chart above, I’ve highlighted how most dips in output tend to be for only a single day – but that there are a couple of occasions where output is down for 2 consecutive days. This is an important observation when thinking through the design for system-wide measures to allow the grid to ride through these dips as the installed capacity of solar continues to climb and it becomes increasingly a dominant form of generation. Insight #3) Challenges in the “measurement” methodology Back in June 2016 I posted about the opacity of small-scale solar PV output . Through analysis since that time (including in this post) I hope I have begun to illustrate why it is essential that we reduce this opacity over time – ideally at a faster rate than new solar PV is added to the system . Unless we do this (whilst at the same time recognising and addressing the the security and privacy implications of such personal consumer data), it would be much harder – or perhaps practically impossible – to systemically manage these points of variability. 3a) Down at the “small” producer end In my post of June 2016 I noted how we didn’t have permission from the APVI to include a history of their estimates for the injections from small-scale PV in historical analysis products like NEMreview . We still don’t – however we hope that this might be changing soon . When this happen, we will be able (for instance) to extend this analysis back before mid 2016 – which will help us see (for instance) whether there is any marked year-on-year variation in results. I am also concerned, longer term, for what happens to “sample and extrapolate” methodologies like these (used by both AEMO, and the APVI) when the incentive for registration via the SRES dries up with the sunset of the RET . With less incentive for households to register their smaller systems (including on upgrades) there will be less knowledge about the installed capacity in the mix, probably leading to more difficult (and poorer quality) strategic and operational decisions. 3b) The missing “middle” It is also worth noting that there is what might already be a significant, and certainly is a growing contribution of solar PV injections from medium-scale solar PV systems that are both too large to the SRES system under the RET, but also too small to have their specific metered data seen (and hence republished) by the AEMO. My understanding that there is some rapid growth happening for projects in the range of hundreds of kilowatts, up to tens of megawatts. Except on rare occasions (like with Gatton solar ) the production at these facilities is not generally visible – and yet will have a growing contribution to system security, and price. Insight #4) Beware the “Magic Wand” In reading the above, there will inevitably be some readers who drag out their own favourite magic wand (Villain #6) and proclaim that “[Insert magic wand here] will be key to overcoming the growing challenges evident in the data reported above!” Whilst each of these measures will help, none are a Magic Wand – and caution should be triggered when any “solution” is presented as one (with alarm bells triggering especially loudly if they make it sound like it will be easy, or that a singular measure will ride in to save the day). Wand A) Geographic Diversity The data above, notwithstanding the earlier comments about its quality/accuracy (Insight #3) , already accounts for a high degree of geographical diversity in solar PV productions – especially because the totals are significantly influenced by the much larger share of small-scale (residential) PV to large scale PV across all regions through 2017, which is the year of the data above. Whilst we (as an industry) should continue to pursue geographical diversity of future solar installations (small, medium and large), we also need to be cognisant that the evidence suggest that the challenges of substantial variability will remain with us for as long as the extent of the interconnection is limited to just “the NEM” , which is already a very large geographic area . Wand B) Demand Response As a company we have been actively supporting large energy users involved in this method of demand response for more than a decade (and others operating under this second method , as well). In the process the load we support in this way has expanded to be hundreds of megawatts across each region of the NEM. We’ve learnt a lot in dealing with these corporate clients along the way. I’m also very interested in understanding how demand response might work at a residential level – so have been thinking this through, especially in the light of collaborations like this initiative between Wattwatchers and Future Grid . With respect to day-by-day variability noted above, keep in mind that this represents significant variability from one day to the next during daylight hours (i.e. making the instantaneous figure for variability during peak daylight hours several times higher than that noted above on a 24-hour average basis). Starting at this point, we then layer on two other insights: 1. Firstly, many (but not all) households show peak demand occurring in evening hours, with very little consumption at home during the day – like mine show here. In these cases, these householders would have little to offer in the way of demand response during daylight hours to cater for the odd days when solar harvest was lower than average. 2. Secondly, in the NEM it’s commercial and industrial load that consumes approximately 70% of the electricity delivered through the grid each year by volume . Peak demand is a different story – but, as noted above, residential peak demand often occurs in the evenings. Hence any call for demand response to deal with “cloudy day low harvest” scenarios would need to be mainly met by business users. In our experience: 2a) business energy users might (and that’s a big “might”) be able to trigger demand response for the handful of times each year that the solar was 20%-50% down on average on a particular day (noting that this might effectively amount to them turning off for the entire day, depending on the response required and numbers of providers, etc…) 2b) my general sense is (based on our direct experience) that it would not be possible for demand response to trigger as frequently as would be required to deal with the variations down to a 20% drop below average. Wand C) Battery Storage Likewise, we’ve been actively involved in several aspects of residential battery storage for a couple years (with some details provided here ), and have also begun assisting some proponents of large-scale battery systems in the NEM. We’ll post more thoughts on battery systems later , but for now keep in mind that these “cloudy day” problems seen in the variability above are whole-day challenges, and in rarer cases might last for 2-3 days NEM-wide. Hence this challenge needs to be understood in terms of what volume of energy storage is required, and when (i.e. ahead of time) these storage systems were to be charged. One useful academic exercise, for instance, would be to look at the significant number of days above-or-below monthly average by 20% or less, and ascertain the size of the storage that would be required to store those bigger days, to enable the storage to discharge on the lower days. Food for a later post that I will link back in here (LINK TO COME) later, if time permits… Wand D) Baseload As I have noted before, this is a term that would be best retired in the near future – both because it does not directly reflect the prime growing need for dispatchable supplies in future , and also because “baseload” has become a lightning rod in the shouting match between both extremes of the Emotion-o-meter . Insight #5) A question being asked internationally Whilst in the process of putting this article together, I came across this FT article “Fickle British weather poses threat to future electricity supplies” talking about similar challenges (but with a more provocative/sensationalistic title) , quoting BNEF studies done for the energy transition in the UK.",

    "title": "What’s the market data saying about this Summer?",
    "date": "16-11-2017 11:33:00 AM",
    "content": "There’s been plenty of news and commentary in the mainstream press on the tight supply-demand balance in the mainland NEM states this summer. With the South Australia system black in 2016, last summer’s load shedding in both SA and NSW , the retirement of Hazelwood, the SA Government’s Energy Plan (including the Neoen / Tesla battery and acquisition of 276 MW of “emergency” generation currently being commissioned on diesel fuel ), AEMO’s recent ESOO outlook publication , actions to procure “demand-side response” or voluntary load reduction capability, and warnings of “Low Reserve” conditions in weekly market notices, it’s not surprising that there is a degree of anxiety about the potential for difficulties over the coming summer months. This note looks briefly at what some of the NEM data are showing as we approach summer and temperatures are already starting to rise. Prices Starting with spot prices, a weekly trend chart since July 2015 produced from NEM-Review v7 shows that while spot prices remain well above historic levels for this time of year, there has actually been a modest downward trend since the end of last summer, and no marked volatility over that period. But spot price averages are backward looking, so what about forward-looking price indicators? The most obvious to use are ASX-traded cap futures, since the price of these products embody the market’s expectations for price volatility – particularly for the extremely high spot prices that might accompany very tight supply-demand balance and certainly in the case of actual load shedding. Cap futures only accumulate value when half-hourly spot prices exceed $300/MWh. This price data is also sourced via NEM-Review from the underlying ASX feed, but I’ve charted the regions and summer quarters in a different format to more clearly differentiate the trends. The first observation is that cap prices for the current quarter are now way below those for Q1 2018 – this is partly because we are already halfway through Q4 2017 and with no volatility to speak of, the realised value of Q4 caps is so far minimal, and there is less time remaining for any future volatility this year to feed into Q4 cap payouts. However even before Q4 started the price relativities showed substantially higher expectations of volatility in Q1 2018 than Q4 2017. This reflects the significantly higher proportion of Q1 during which peak system demands could be expected (from early January to early March in most regions), relative to Q4 when the period of highest potential demand does not generally start until late in November or early December. Focusing on Q1 2018 cap prices, there is a clear pattern in all mainland regions of prices peaking early in the year – as events of Q1 2017 unfolded – then falling away until about August / September at which point a sharp return to upwards trend appears in SA and Vic and to a lesser extent in NSW. Notably the Q1 2018 Vic cap price is now double its level at the start of this year. It’s also clear that the market is judging the risks of price volatility in Q1 next year to be significantly higher in SA and Victoria than in NSW or Queensland. This is consistent with supply-demand balance assessments such the AEMO ESOO pointing to higher risks in the southern mainland states. In fact it was probably the release of the ESOO in early September, with its focus on potential unserved energy, that also prompted the reversal in Q1 2018 cap price trends. Finally, close observers of the charts may pick out a kick up in prices within the last few weeks – this might reflect increased focus on AEMO’s “Low Reserve” notices for the next few months, published in conjunction with its weekly “MT PASA” data. System Reserve Levels and PASA On any given Tuesday, AEMO publishes a market notice like this: This notice highlights any periods and regions where AEMO’s Medium Term “PASA” process has identified shortfalls in system reserve levels (various measures of headroom between available supply and potential maximum demand) in any region over the period of the next two years. Unlike the ESOO modelling and publication which comprise a detailed analysis of supply adequacy generally undertaken annually or semi-annually, “PASA” (Projected Assessment of System Adequacy) refers to a suite of capacity adequacy assessments run regularly at much higher frequency – every few hours for the Short Term (ST) PASA covering the next seven days, weekly for the Medium Term (MT) PASA covering the next two years. These assessments attempt to reflect changes in generation and network availability due to outages, real time demand and wind / solar generation forecasts in the case of ST PASA, and their outputs highlight periods where system reserves may not meet a range of reliability criteria (which vary depending on the time horizon of the assessment). The market data portal on AEMO’s website provides a graphical viewer for some of the MT PASA data – shown here for South Australia: However it isn’t explained on the AEMO portal exactly what this data represents, especially what a “Reserves Shortfall” means in practical terms, the basis of the demand “forecast” (often this is a “P10” demand maximum expected to occur only once in ten years and therefore well above a median expectation), and why the chart above shows some periods where demand appears to exceed supply but there is no matching reserve shortfall. (The answer may be to do with the complexities of “reserve sharing” between NEM regions.) More generally, the details of AEMO’s PASA processes and accompanying data are very obscure and not at all well documented for casual observers. A bit of hunting through the AEMO website turns up a detailed process description with references to data models and some highly involved example calculations, but it’s still far from easy to understand. Products like ez2view provide a much more granular and configurable set of tools for accessing and visualising PASA data than the AEMO data portal, but again the key issue is one of first understanding what that data mean. Absent this, it’s not surprising to see press reports of “impending blackouts” when the data may really mean that their likelihood is still relatively low. Nevertheless I think we can broadly conclude that under extreme conditions the risk of supply shortfalls persists in the southern NEM states, reflected in these MT PASA reserve shortfalls, and from here what is probably most important to monitor are changes in the outlook being presented. As more elements of AEMO’s summer readiness program and Reserve and Emergency Response Trader (RERT) tender are finalised and revealed in coming weeks, we would expect to see further changes in the PASA outlook. Plant Availability A key summer reliability driver and input to the PASA processes is the level of generation plant availability in each region. Registered NEM generators are required to maintain an updated view of their forecast availability for future periods extending out several years. Using ez2view ’s PASA widget provides a view of the aggregate availability in each region. The views below for the next 12 months in South Australia and Victoria show that total available generation is not yet at the maximum level expected over summer, which partly explains why there are potential reserve shortfalls forecast later in November in the MT PASA results shown above – however remember that reserve shortfalls would only translate into risks to supply under extreme demand (weather) conditions.

    "title": "Some initial musings about my own Rooftop Solar Learning Exercise",
    "date": "07-11-2017 01:34:00 PM",
    "content": "As frequent readers of WattClarity know, we’re a Brisbane-based software company that operates in the Australian energy sector – with a focus on making complexity understandable, so people can make better decisions . We’re particularly inquisitive, about any energy-sector data (particularly relating to this unfolding energy transition ). The huge ongoing escalation in data volumes is a challenge for us (and everyone else), but also represents a big opportunity to do things better. (A) Our own experiences with Solar PV at home We see our workplace as being fairly “typical” of the broader community in some ways* with respect to the prevalence of residential rooftop PV – such as with respect to the following distribution: Our personal experiences with the financial benefits of solar at home Type 1 We have a number of employees who are fortunate enough to receive the very generous, long-lasting 44c/kWh net feed-in tariff. This includes myself, as noted here before (though not without some realisation that others, including those not as fortunate, are paying for our “bonus” ). Type 2 We have had other employees (like Jamey, featured in this article ) who missed out on this opportunity – only installing PV after the closure of the generous FIT schemes for various reasons Type 3 We have other employees who (because of renting, renovating, or other reasons) are not able to access any benefits from their own solar. Given this diversity (which, again, we see as fairly typical*) there is a fair bit of diversity of views apparent with respect to the effects of what’s been described by others as Australia’s Solar-Coaster Ride . * we understand we’re not really going to be representative in other ways (for instance, we would have a higher level of energy literacy (LINK TO COME) than would the “average” business or community). (B) Trending through past couple months It was apparently Yogi Berra who quipped “ you can observe a lot by watching ” (he even wrote a book with the title ). Whilst it might be seen as a truism, from another frame of reference it is sometimes important to highlight what is otherwise “hidden in plain sight”. That’s what we strive to accomplish in our various energy sector dashboards (e.g. NEM-Watch and our higher-end products like ez2view ). It’s also what drove us to upgrade our view (at home) of the output of our residential solar PV production levels: 1) I noted that we were doing this back in August , and thought it was timely to check back in and post some initial observations. 2) My timing also prompted by this article last Wednesday titled “We need to talk about talk about rooftop solar” by Martina Calais of Murdoch University at One Step Off The Grid seeking feedback from people about their own solar powered experiences. 3) As someone striving to objective about all different types of technology “solutions” (to the point where the over-used label “solution” irks me somewhat) we’re continuing to strive to understand the good points, and the bad, about every technology (including solar PV). 4) Given that the technology is so central to the “most likely” path that Australia seems to be currently following in terms of this energy transition at the same time as being so opaque , the need to be so objective and detailed now is especially so in terms of small-scale solar. Hence, in the interests of pushing a real conversation along on this note, here’s what data we currently have access to at home. Apologies for the size of the image in the article – click on it for a better view. (C) A few specific questions and/or observations On the chart above, I have highlighted a few specific time ranges – for each of which I have added some specific commentary below. I’ve done this in the interests of helping the energy supply sector continue to grow to better serve all energy users – rather than to specifically single out any particular company, service provider, or service type. Time period 0 = out with the old and in with the new Before we start on the time periods highlighted in the image above, I should highlight one of the main triggers that prompted the change in August – from a free service (inverter data to PV output ) to a paid service ( Watt Watchers gadget within a Solar Analytics front end ) – was the increasingly frequent occurrence of missing data from the free service. I’ve flagged one in the chart above. With the main driver for us at home being the cash benefit received from the generous 44c/kWh feed in tariff we enjoy, we have seen financial justification for watching the output of our small power plant (i.e. to give us near real time feedback, so we have the capability of responding to any unexpected drops in output). The justification for sticking with our first solution dropped significantly when we started to experience drop-outs in the data (especially when they were for unknown reasons, for unknown durations). As our confidence in the first “solution” dropped away, our interest in alternatives similarly rose…. Key take-away #1 This, to us, represents another example of why Data Integrity is the key – especially in the electricity supply sector, where supply and demand need to be managed in real time. Time period 1 = initial teething issues … so we upgrades our data view to a commercial offering provided by Solar Analytics. This brings us to Time Period 1 highlighted on the first chart above – which is also shown in more detail here: During this period, we came face-to-face with one of the challenges of distributed generation – whilst the production might be automatic, and low short-run marginal cost, anything to do with the management and service of the apparatus (or the gadgets that monitor it) is time and labour intensive – which means both: 1) there is a non-negligible cost to it (both direct and indirect); and 2) being distributed, and hence relying on a large number of different people for Australia-wide coverage, the challenges of Quality Assurance are one that the industry needs to confront head on (we’ve seen this in Pink Batts, we’ve seen dodgy solar panels and installations, and we’ll no doubt see a share of dodgy battery installs – which is particularly concerning given the broader range of risks, which is why we’ve been working on this ). In our case we’d already had the solar installed for a couple years, and then moved and replaced again after the roof was written off in a hail storm (not without a snag in the reconnection, though – which will be a story for another day). In this article I’m only focusing on the monitoring – but even in this case we had four different parties effectively involved, in addition to us as the Home Owner: Four different parties effectively involved Stakeholder #1 Original Electrician Implicit in this process, we had the original electrician our builder had used in the renovation of our house. Certainly a factor in the colourful words emanating from Stakeholder #2 when trying to install the monitoring gadget in the Circuit Board. Stakeholder #2 PV Installer Monitoring Gadget Installer In our case this was a one-and-the-same party, but my impression was that this was a large coincidence –> we contacted Solar Analytics to purchase the gadget, and they arranged one of their agents in Brisbane to install the thing. It just happened to be that this agent was the company we’d purchased the PV and inverter package from in the first place. Stakeholder #3 Solar Analytics We have Solar Analytics, who are our supplier, in this case – and the ones we speak with in order to get access to the data (though software written by the growing Solar Analytics team). Stakeholder #4 Watt Watchers Last but not least, we have Watt watchers – who we did not have to speak with at all through the process, but who I knew made the core technology within the gadget that enabled the Solar Analytics software offering. Though probably many other customers would not, or would not care. As a general rule, I believe that the more different parties involved in a supply chain, the harder the process is to manage in order to ensure things do not fall through the cracks. My own experience (i.e. a sample size of 1 – so certainly not representative) was useful in illustrating this point. In this case, we had the Gadget installer come onsite and (after a number of colourful words about the quality of work of the initial electricians in our Circuit Board) install the gadget. After physical install, there was then a software configuration step. At this point several hours had elapsed and the data that was being displayed did not look quite right. I had a fair idea of what the data should look like, but still had to wait a couple days to confirm what my instinct was telling me at the time – at which point I was able to arrange for the installer to come back and have another go. The chart above shows the 14 day duration in between the visits (note that the reasons for which were due, at least in part, to my busy schedule) over which neither the consumption nor production data was what I was expecting to see. However during this time I was thinking about the “Average Joe” consumer who perhaps would not have known enough to understand that something was not correct with the data – and I wonder what the proportion is of people who are dealing with these sorts or issues (e.g. with their data from solar or storage – or, more broadly, just in terms of retail bills)? This, I see, as one of the core challenges in the distributed energy space – and is summed up in the annotation on the first chart being a customer “Falling through the cracks #1” . Re-iterating Key take-away #1 This only emphasised more strongly that Data Integrity is the key – however it also flags the general problem of the yawning deficit in Energy Literacy Adequacy (LINK TO COME) that is presenting huge risks to the emerging energy transition. Thankfully, we were able to sort the data glitches out and we were onto the second time period… Time period 2 = smooth sailing … During this period it really did seem like “smooth sailing”. The data was correct, and this corresponded (purely by coincidence) with bright sunny days when our solar harvest was quite good – as indicated in this chart here: Three things occurred to us during this time – or, more truthfully speaking: 1) two things did occur to us, but 2) another (big) thing did not occur to us, but really should have given our penchant for analysis and objectivity … The first observation during this period was triggered by some friendly email alerts that I started to receive (part of the by-product of the registration process with Solar Analytics) that appear squarely aimed at incentivising residential users to self-consume their own solar production (i.e. by shifting load – like the laundry and the dishes etc – into the middle of the day). Here’s a snapshot highlighting just 30th August: In the first chart above, I have highlighted this as a customer “Falling through the cracks #2” . By this I mean to say that it highlights, to me, the inherent desire to simplify the complexities inherent in each person’s unique sets of motivations (to build a “model”, as it were, despite knowing that a model’s just a model – it’s not reality ). Whilst I understand that there are both macro (i.e. addressing the “duck curve” ) and micro (i.e. for those energy users on more miserly FIT where the incentive is reversed to mine) incentives for some to shift consumption to the middle of the day, the main point here is that it’s not the only possible (rational) incentive structure. Indeed, there are 400,000 customers still in Queensland on the 44c FIT whose rational incentive is to shift consumption outside of daylight hours (exacerbating the “duck curve” in the process). Key take-away #2 We (as energy users) are not a homogeneous mix. The broader energy supply sector (that’s most of us now, as well) needs to understand this and not assume “one size fits all”. I did highlight this to some key people at Solar Analytics on the sidelines of All Energy a month ago. The reason I bring this up more publicly here is not (at all) to bag them here (in fact, I see this company as one of several start-ups in the space that are promising great things, and starting to show signs of delivery). Rather, I use this example to make concrete a broader challenge that is inherent with being a start-up: Key take-away #3 Start-ups are start-ups. They have not perfected everything about their offer – and nor do they (currently) have the budget, or knowledge, to do so. This means that there is some inherent uncertainty about the extent to which they can do this, and hence achieve massive scale. This is a challenge to them (at an atomic level) but is also a systemic challenge to the energy supply sector, if much of the energy transition is assuming that these new technologies (and business models) will emerge to support the new ecosystem of the future. Whilst we’ve been around for close to 18 years, we feel the same sorts or pressures every day – given the massive ways the energy sector is changing, and the steps we’re taking to (hopefully) stay ahead of the core changes that particularly matter to us, and our clients. If you think you can help us with these challenges, always happy to hear from you. Now the two observations (TA#2 and TA#3) above were apparent to us when we received the automatically-triggered notifications. I still shake my head, however, when remembering the metaphorical “self-congratulatory pats on the back” we were giving ourselves during the “sunny days forever” period when we were seeing production consistently higher than consumption… and weren’t we so good, etc… It particularly irks me, given a drive for objective analysis and reason, that I could have essentially forgotten that not all days would be like this – something that was essentially only apparent when the rains started coming. At that time (Time Period 4) realisation returned that there were (of course!) dependent on the weather for our solar harvest – and financial bonus. I fell into that classic “recency bias” cognitive trap. Key take-away #4 Everyone is subject to a “recency bias”, which is one of the core analytical challenges I have highlighted separately here . But before the rains came (thankfully) we took a short holiday… Time period 3 = brief holiday … therefore triggering what I have flagged as Time Period #3 on the chart at the top – and have expanded here: This period triggered two different types of observations which I thought it might be useful to share: Firstly, seeing this data (out of curiosity I had even checked it remotely, whilst away for the period) so clearly indicate a big reduction in usage pattern did bring home for me the concerns flagged by others in relation to the confidentiality of a customer’s data – both in terms of access by some unidentified 3rd party (e.g. a hacker, perhaps) but also in terms of the various parties (e.g. Stakeholders #2, #3 and #4 in the table above) who have been involved in the establishment of the monitoring device). Whilst the concern in our case might be that someone (remotely) could discern that the house was unoccupied, I can envisage others might have different types of concerns. In the interests of ensuring some balance, I also flag here that this data could be very beneficial (e.g. such as a case of watching usage patterns and triggering alerts if expected events did not happen – like Grandma not switching the kettle on one morning by an expected time). Key take-away #5 There are real and valid concerns about confidentiality of data that the energy supply sector (including the new entrants) needs to address. Also here was a curiosity about the level of parasitic load evident in our household – starting with even knowing whether what we saw during those days was either good, or bad. As noted, we did (partly out of curiosity) consciously switch a few things off – such as a few PCs that are rarely off otherwise – but did leave other things running on standby (plus fridge and freezer, of course). Here’s the profile through 20th September, which really does reinforce the “no one’s home” theme: I am genuinely interested to hear from those who know more than me to help me understand if that sort of usage pattern is to be expected with everyone away for the day (i.e. 5kWh over the day, shaped like that)? Key take-away #6 This experience also did remind me that energy efficiency is remains the unloved “ugly sister” of the growing family that sees attention feted on the three younger siblings named Wind, Solar and Storage. On the topic of energy efficiency, worth flagging that the National Energy Efficiency Conference 2017 is coming up on 20th and 21st November in Melbourne . Also reiterating Key Take Away #3 (repeated below) I should just flag that on 25th September (i.e. after we’d just returned from holiday) we received this helpful congratulatory message: Reiterating Key take-away #3 Start-ups are start-ups. Here’s another example of where the offer has not quite been perfected… Tongue-in-cheek, I observe that the guys at Solar Analytics are encouraging us to always be on holidays as a method for increasing our energy efficiency! Time period 4 = stormy waters During time period 2 (above) we must have passed through many days without seeing a cloud in the sky – though, at the time, I fell into the “recency bias” trap of subconsciously assuming that it would all continue with the sunny day output for all time. As time progressed, however, things returned to normal and we did start to experience days where Brisbane received some welcome rain – and our solar output suffered as a result: I’ve flagged five days in October (2nd October, 12th October, 16th & 17th October, and 21st October) of particularly poor performance. Just like yin-and-yang ( here with wind ) this did focus our minds on what the implications are of these stormy days right across the NEM. One of our guest authors has previously highlighted NEM-wide cloud patterns that delivered the very low NEM-wide solar harvest seen on Friday 19th May 2017 . On the days of rainy weather in October, my mind did go to wondering how frequently these sorts of patterns exist. Hence running some analysis with the AEMO estimates for small-scale solar PV out of NEM-Review v6 , which have been posted here in a separate article . Key take-away #7 A balance of generation sources is required for the energy supply system of the future – just as has been the case for the past 100 years. Time period 5 = escalating data requirements As noted before, we’re a company full of data junkies of different flavours, and I am particularly inquisitive about all different sorts of energy sector data. Hence a general curiosity about what data might become more available with the rise and rise of distributed energy sources, buried deep in the distribution network. However there are particular needs, as well – such as: Need #1) Our need, at home, to watch our solar production closely , in order to ensure that we can quickly respond to any unexpected dip in production and so ensure our FiT payment is maximised each quarter. Need #2) At work, we’re particularly interested in understanding what data is becoming more ubiquitous, in order that this can feed into our discussions with various clients (and potential clients) about problems they might want us to help them solve. Whilst Need #1 has been met completely by our recent upgrade to a paid service, and has also (temporarily) sated our appetite for more and more data, we do have a specific additional need. Need #3) Back at home, we’ve been blowing LEDs over the past couple years, which is a pain in a number of ways. I’ve been wondering if this was due to voltage in some way, and have also wondered if the cluster of solar systems on the end of our distribution line has been a contributing factor to that, but had not been able to check (no monitoring). Possible Key take-away #8 It may be that this is an example of unintended consequences of the rise of residential PV. When I know more, I will post more on this… As such, I was curious to know if our new gadget would afford us this capability – hence put in a call to some of the people we know at Solar Analytics to see if it was possible. Sure enough, I received a prompt response from one of the team with one view of data that did show some periods of low voltage (which might be a cause!), and with a promise to enable my access, so I could do a bit more digging. However I have not yet seen that access, and have mentally labelled this “Falling through the cracks #3” . Key take-away #9 There are certain theories that hold that a business’ demanding customers are the ones that lead the company towards new opportunities. In the interests of balance, however, it’s necessary to point out that others hold a very different perspective. I recognise that I’m probably pushing the offering more than a “normal” client might do, but I have several reasons to be very curious about the types of data that are available. I can also remember a variety of occasions where we have had demanding clients stretch us in a variety of ways – on some occasions having a good effect (strengthening our core offering, to the benefit of all of our clients) whilst on other occasions being an expensive distraction for no broader benefit. Stay tuned, in another couple months, for a further update.",

    "title": "No Guarantee of Success",
    "date": "27-10-2017 09:58:00 AM",
    "content": "The NEM and its associated – but quite separate – contract markets are a complex physical and economic system, and since commencement nearly two decades ago changes to either have been incremental, long in gestation, and actively debated. So it’s more than a little surprising that the federal government’s proposed National Energy Guarantee (“ NEG ”) framework, which would represent the largest and most significant set of changes to those markets yet, has been unveiled with great haste, no consultation, and very limited detail, but has received widespread, if cautious, acceptance. Even more surprising when almost nothing in the Finkel Review – to which the NEG is a response – recommended or presaged these particular changes, or anything closely resembling them. Partly for reasons of space but also because I suspect it’s both less well understood and a bigger change to the NEM design than its counterpart “Emissions Guarantee”, I’ll focus here on four issues arising from the NEG’s “Reliability Guarantee” (“ NEGRG” ). 1) Administered Investment A fundamental concept underlying the NEM’s design was that market prices would drive capacity investment or exit, with individual market participants responding to price signals and deciding when, how much, and what sort of generation capacity to invest in (or decommission), and whether or not to modify their demand in response to prices. Provided these signals reflected supply-demand balance and the underlying economics of generation and demand, then reliability (the ability of installed capacity to meet demand at all times) would be maintained via competitive market dynamics – tightening supply-demand balance driving higher prices motivating new capacity investment etc. AEMO was given a “backstop” role in monitoring and if necessary providing for physical reliability up to the mandated NEM standard through mechanisms such as the Reserve and Emergency Trader powers , which was designed to not mute the high price signals that would otherwise flow from reduced reliability. The NEG’s Reliability Guarantee thrusts AEMO into a “central planner” role of dictating the minimum dispatchable capacity levels to be built in the market, which are then administratively enforced via retailers being required to contract a specific proportion of their peak demand with certain forms of generation or demand response providers. Capacity investment will therefore be primarily driven by centrally-planned targets and administrative compliance requirements, not market price signals. Apparently the judgement has been made that there has been a collective “failure” of market participants to invest in new capacity in response to recent high prices and that this is definitive evidence that a core design principle of the NEM was wrong. Alternative explanations for this “failure to invest” (yet) such as: complete lack of clarity around investment risks such as carbon policy, disruption in key fuel markets (gas supply), or simple lack of time to respond to the sudden closure of large generators, appear to have been discounted. Even if it is accepted, other possible solutions to this “market failure” – such as the Finkel Review’s recommendations to further evaluate capacity and day-ahead markets – have been discarded prematurely. (That said, the Finkel Review’s proposed “Generator Reliability Obligation” (which would not proceed under the NEGRG) was a rather poorly thought through response to the same alleged market failure.) 2) Dispatchables Ain’t Dispatchables There is a strong focus in the NEG reliability framework on “dispatchable” resources (generation or controllable load response), but no real discussion of the important differences between different types of “dispatchables” as far as their contribution to system reliability goes. A couple of key points: “Dispatchability” is not a binary concept. There are many different factors affecting the controllability and robustness of different generation or demand-side resources (startup or notice times, energy production / storage constraints, ramp rates, minimum run times, annual availability, failure rates, mean time between failures, mean time to repair, …). These differences can make it very hard to directly compare different forms of dispatchable resource, and to quantify their contributions to system reliability in isolation. Reliability is a property of the entire system, not of individual generators or generation types. It is from the interplay between generation, demand, and the unpredictable factors driving them (outages, weather etc) that system reliability levels emerge. This means that any given type and quantity of “dispatchable resource” could have very different contributions to reliability at different times or in different regions of the NEM (and in fact the same is true even of non-dispatchable resources, which also make some contribution to reliability) AEMO’s task of determining minimum “percentages of dispatchable resources” which retailers must contract under the NEG Reliability Guarantee is going to be very challenging, and it will be equally difficult to quantify and summarise the contribution of different individual dispatchable resources via blunt percentage metrics. As a simple example, consider a 100 MW gas-fired generator which may take 10 minutes to start up but can then generate continuously, versus a 100 MW demand response contract which can operate to reduce load within seconds, but only for a maximum period of 1 hour, with no subsequent reduction then available until the next day. Clearly these resources contribute very differently to system reliability depending on the nature and duration of any threat to supply-demand balance. It is completely unclear how such different sources – which both meet the broad criteria for dispatchability – would be treated under the NEGRG. 3) Contracts Are Not Physical The “ Advice document ” produced by the Energy Security Board (“ ESB “) describes the role and nature of electricity market contracts in terms which are overly simplistic and potentially very misleading. This is important because it significantly understates the complexity and potential side-effects of enforcing the proposed Reliability and Emissions Guarantees. And while AEMO, AER and AEMC currently have little or no direct involvement in them, the contract markets are integral to the efficient and effective operation of the wholesale electricity sector. There is not space here to go into the detail of how these markets operate, but a fundamental issue is that electricity contracts used in the NEM are overwhelmingly financial derivatives linked to a NEM regional spot price, but with no references to physical generation output or retail demand. They are standardised and tradeable “pieces of paper” used by market participants to hedge (or seek profit from) the financial risks arising from the volatility of NEM spot prices. AEMO and AER currently have virtually no role in operation or oversight of these contracts, which are either bilateral “over-the-counter” (“ OTC ”) trades between counterparties (who do not have to be physical participants in the spot market), or standardised electricity futures contracts on the ASX Energy (“ ASXE ”) exchange-traded platform. The structure of the NEG Reliability Guarantee seems to assume that these contracts are akin to simple energy purchase agreements where retailers buy physical electricity from generators. This is not the case. Production and delivery of electricity does not occur under derivative contracts, only monetary exchanges. Retailers may enter into various types of derivative contracts with generators , but also with other retailers, or with purely financial counterparties such as banks. Regardless of counterparty, these are financial contracts and are only very rarely linked in any way to volumes of physical electricity actually produced or consumed. Futures contracts traded via ASXE do not represent physical electricity and carry no information on the identity of any generator or retailer which may have originally sold or bought them (in fact the counterparty to any futures contract traded is the futures exchange itself). Generators can sell OTC or futures contracts and fully meet their contractual obligations without physically running any generation – not infrequently this is their most economic approach. The proposed NEGRG arrangements imply that these contracts and futures instruments will henceforth need to carry identifying data and specify physical parameters showing their “source”, that source’s “dispatchability”, how to measure actual generation volumes and so on. This is a dramatic and radical change to the nature of electricity contracts, making them much more like agreements for physical supply, and could have substantial effects on the overall operation of the wholesale markets well beyond any impacts on reliability. The ESB Advice is very unclear here, but there are hints that measuring compliance with the NEGRG may involve assessment of “ actual output and availability of the dispatchable capacity ” specified in the relevant contracts. This is a concept completely foreign to the operation of most current electricity derivative contracts, and could lead to very economically inefficient participant behaviour if enforced literally. In being linked to specific sources of generation, storage or demand-side capability, contracts would become much less standardised and therefore far less interchangeable and tradeable; it is likely that liquidity via secondary trading in the contract markets would substantially decrease. It is unclear that futures contracts could be adapted at all to the proposed NEGRG requirements, and might wither away entirely. Decreased tradeability, liquidity and supply of contracts seems far more likely to increase contract prices and contracting costs – and therefore wholesale electricity costs – than to lower them. Finally there is a significant risk that the greater complexity and reduced liquidity of the contract market will substantially advantage larger integrated participants like the “big three” gentailers who own and control both retail and generation assets, relative to smaller players, again leading to less competitive and efficient overall market outcomes. 4) What’s The Role Of The Spot Market? With the NEG placing an enhanced quasi-physical role on the electricity contract market, and completely altering the basis for capacity investment, the role of the spot market may be correspondingly diminished to something more like a “balancing” or “overs / unders” market, where differences between contract positions and actual demand and generation levels are liquidated. The ESB Advice document states that the “ cost of any non-compliance [between NEGRG contract quantities and physical generation volumes] is based on the real time spot price ”. In the same section, the document also discusses how the “ actual requirement for flexible, dispatchable capacity would be dynamic, varying dispatch period by dispatch period ”, and a potential need for AEMO to “ develop processes to the inform the market as to the estimated requirement and dispatch that in real time ”. Although this is almost exactly what AEMO already does in operating the real time spot market – namely calculates and schedules, dispatch interval by dispatch interval, the controllable resources required to balance demand – the statements in the ESB Advice seem to imply a different or additional real time process, without attempting to explain what this is or how it differs from the current spot market. Without more detailed information it’s difficult to comment further, but given the far-reaching changes proposed to the current contracting framework, it’s not hard to anticipate correspondingly significant changes to the spot market itself. Conclusion Although it has been presented and in some quarters hailed as a “solution” to the ills besetting the wholesale electricity sector, the NEG in its current, very preliminary and sketched-out form is nothing more than an outline of one possible framework among many. It doesn’t appear to build on nor address much of the careful analysis in the Finkel Review, and its present embryonic structure raises at least as many questions as it purports to answer. It seems far too premature to declare the NEG a potentially effective – or even workable – approach to dealing with the challenges of the energy transition, let alone the most efficient solution. Hopefully the processes of consultation and development which the government has now promised to embark on will properly address the concerns above, and lead to a practical and effective strategy for the NEM’s further evolution.

    "title": "Possibilities of Peak Demand (VIC and SA) during summer 2017-18",
    "date": "25-10-2017 02:44:00 PM",
    "content": "The Bureau of Meteorology’s latest ENSO Outlook has activated a La Nina watch , indicating a 50% to 70% chance of a La Nina event developing during this upcoming summer. This would be the first La Nina event since the back-to-back La Nina summers of 2010-11 and 2011-12. La Nina events often (but not always) suppress extreme heat across Australia’s eastern states, due to the lack of westerly winds that send the Interior heat eastward to Brisbane and Sydney. Instead, sea breezes tend to easily set up across coastal Queensland and New South Wales during the mid-to-late afternoon summer hours, thus often suppressing temperatures through the critical hours of peak demand. This pattern would be in stark contrast to recent summers, where both Brisbane and Sydney were frequent targets of extreme temperatures. With the knowledge of La Nina-like conditions developing during the upcoming Summer 2017-18, I thought it might prove valuable to reflect on the climatology of heat waves in the southern states, for two reasons: (1) The last 3 summers vs. climatology: The most recent three summers saw only middle-of-the-road heat events, particularly in Melbourne. The hottest days also often occurred on weekends or holidays. Thus, it’s a good time to reflect on the actual climatology of extreme heat in the southern states, and what we should be prepared for. (2) The Summer 2017-18 Forecast: While extreme heat events are likely to be suppressed for east coast cities due to the predicted La Nina-like conditions, the same cannot be said for the southern states. We will need to keep watch for southern NEM heat waves this summer. PREDICTING PEAK DEMAND USING COOLING DEGREE DAYS While it is well known that peak daily demand is highly correlated to temperatures, it may be less known that it can be better predicted using Cooling Degree Days, rather than using only daily maximum temperatures. Cooling Degree Days (CDDs) are frequently used internationally in order to help quantify the amount of demand for energy needed to cool a home or business. The daily CDD value is calculated by taking the average of that day’s minimum and maximum temperature, and subtracting it by 18 degrees. Negative values are bounded to zero. In other words, the Cooling Degree Day index assumes that there is a linear relationship between a day’s average temperature and its peak demand, for days with an average temperature above 18 degrees . While far from a perfect relationship, the correlation produces a good first-order estimate for the temperature’s effect on summer energy demand. By looking at historical CDD values for a particular city or region, we are able to gain some valuable insights on how historical weather patterns would translate into peak demand today. ADELAIDE Looking back at CDD values from 1981 to 2017, the highest daily CDD value during a given summer (ignoring values on weekends and holidays) is usually around 15 to 16 CDDs . Given the correlation between CDD values and peak demand, a day with a CDD value of 15 to 16 would require approximately 1400-1500 MW of additional electricity during the time of peak demand, purely due to the cooling of homes and businesses. However, every 1 in 10 years, Adelaide is expected to have at least one summer workday that reaches 18 cooling degree days . This extreme would require an additional 250 MW of electricity vs. a more typical hottest day of summer. Furthermore, there is a pronounced warming trend over recent decades with respect to extreme heat in Adelaide. Using a simple linear trend, this summer’s adjusted climatology would suggest a most likely value of 16 to 17 CDDs , with a 1-in-10 chance of a day registering at 19 CDDs . Looking at the last ten summers in Adelaide, we can clearly see the heatwaves of January 2009 and January 2014 , registering as streaks of daily CDD values between 17 and 21. More recently during the last three summers, daily CDD values have peaked closer to the long-term norm. However, the most noteworthy fact of this graph: Even though last summer’s hottest days in early February proved critically hot for the South Australia electricity grid, last summer was the only summer in the last 10 years to have its peak workday CDD value fall below the long-term average – 15.0 CDDs on 9 February 2017 vs. the long-term average of 15.5 CDDs. Also worth noting: the highest CDD value last summer was on 7 January – a Saturday. Had it fallen on a weekday, this may have instead proven the day of peak demand last summer, and serves as a reminder that the heat seen in early February 2017 is relatively common, and serves more as a typical summer peak rather than an extreme one for Adelaide. MELBOURNE Using a 1981-2017 climatology, Melbourne typically sees a peak value of 11 to 12 CDDs in any given summer, when excluding weekends and holidays. This translates to roughly 2700 to 2900 MW of additional electricity demand during peak hours, purely due to the use of air conditioning and cooling devices. The 1-in-10 year value for Melbourne is 15 cooling degree days . Using the approximate linear relationship between CDD values and peak demand, we’d expect an additional 700 to 800 MW of energy demand during 1-in-10 year hot day vs. a typical hottest summer day. A similar multi-decadal warming trend is in the data for Melbourne, and thus an extrapolated 2017 climatology would be around 12 to 13 CDDs , with a 1-in-10 year peak of 16 CDDs . The most recent three summers have all seen peak demand below the long-term average , which is even more pronounced when considering the warming trend of extreme heat in Melbourne. It is also important to note that the last three summers’ suppressed peak demand in Melbourne were partly due to the hottest days falling on weekends and holidays, thus not translating to extreme electricity demand. The hottest day of the summer typically falls on a weekend or holiday only 40% of the time, thus the frequency of extreme heat missing the workdays over the last three summers is an anomaly rather than the norm. SUMMER 2017-18 vs. the previous three summers A forecast for Summer 2017-18 can be made by using CDDs as a proxy for peak demand, and assuming an adjusted climatology as the best forecast for the upcoming summer. Adelaide ’s most likely peak demand this summer will be in the vicinity of peak demands of the previous three summers , with the added knowledge that a 1-in-10-year hot workday would result in demand approximately 250MW above the peaks of recent summers. Melbourne is quite a different story however, with recent summers falling below the long-term trend, and well below the adjusted climatological mean value of 12.5 CDDs. This alone implies that this summer’s peak demand will most likely come in about 400 MW higher than the typical peak demand values of the last three summers . However, of more concern is the 1-in-10-year value of 16 CDDs. The resultant peak demand is estimated to be 1100 to 1200 MW above the peak demand values of recent summers. This likelihood of higher peak demand than in recent summers is further exacerbated by the slightly increased chance of Adelaide-Melbourne combination heat that can come with La Nina summers. A common mechanism for southern NEM extreme heat during La Nina events is for northerly wind flows to send Interior heat into Adelaide and Melbourne, in the wake of slow-moving high pressure systems that can occasionally stall in the Tasman Sea. This setup has the ability to give heat to both Adelaide and Melbourne at the same time, and often for more than one day in a row. Equally important to note is the tendency for wind power generation to be both low and on the decline through the afternoon hours during these types of setups.

    "title": "Villain #2 – we, the voting public",
    "date": "11-10-2017 06:33:00 AM",
    "content": "On Monday I nominated our present, past and prospective politicians as Villain #1 in running this energy transition off the rails . At the end of that article I noted (as I had when I spoke at the CEC’s “Clean Energy Summit” in July) a high degree of scepticism that we will achieve durable bi-partisan policy position in relation to this multi-faceted energy transition . When I made that comment in July, (to me) it seemed at odds with a more generally optimistic mood amongst the authors of what I had been reading, and what I had heard from other speakers. Unfortunately I could not be at the AFR’s “National Energy Summit” this week in Sydney – but I am keenly interested in where the discussions have ended up. Hence, at the end of the day on Tuesday, I logged into the AFR and was greeted with the following list of articles related to energy: I have highlighted two, in particular, that take a distinctly more pessimistic tone than I had become accustomed to reading and hearing: Jennifer Hewitt wrote “ Energy policy stability was always remote ” ; and Mark Ludlow wrote “Energy policy stability is a ‘fairytale’ ” . Sad that it might be, I do also think that it’s a more objectively realistic perspective on the chances of a real, durable evolution arising (collectively) out of all of the Parliaments that matter around the country. Now, “Beat up on a politician” might be a popular pastime for many – in public conversations, and in private ones. In my post on Monday, I participated in the same pursuit . To be clear – it is very clear to me that they leave themselves very open to these criticisms levelled at them. However, if we are all honest with ourselves, we have to admit that we, the voting public, are collectively Villain #2 causing the energy policy train wreck . In my discussion at “Clean Energy Summit” back in July, I outlined some of why I thought that this was the case. Not long before that talk, the following image had been posted on Twitter by an Australian who is concerned about climate change, and supports measures to tackle it: It should be noted that the data in the chart above is US data, rather than for Australia specifically – however my sense is that Australian data would be roughly similar, at least from the perspective of the following two points. I saw this particular tweet as very neatly combining two of the realisations i had been making in relation to the emerging train wreck, and root causes of this – hence I flagged it in my talk, and do so again now: Realisation #1 = that, taking into account the 10 year time-range of the query, both the red and the blue lines are stubbornly stuck on about their respective levels over a decade . Two key points about this: 1a) This is despite the enormous volume of discussion and debate about the climate change, and the causes of it all over the airwaves and internet (and even a full length movie or two) over the intervening 10 year period. I find that staggering, and quite explanatory. 1b) Whilst the blue line above is slightly above 50%, and some will focus on this the more important point is there is a significant volume of people in both camps – enough, in either camp, to invoke a massive swing in an election of the day when combined with other factors. This has contributed to the see-saw of energy policy over the past decade or more. Realisation #2 is equally important, I believe – and that is that others will view a slight change in one measure and (in my view) read it out of proportion to its real significance (with Ketan’s tweet as an example of that – with apologies to Ketan for singling him out). Another case of (in my view) “missing the wood for the trees” [LINK TO COME]. Couple these realisations with my inference that the there seem to have been disproportionately vocal groups of people at either end of the Emotion-o-meter that have been drowning out the larger volume of people in between* the two extremes and I see that we, the voting public, have stacked the odds very heavily against any chance that our political class could come together (across all parties, at state and federal level) to craft a durable, pragmatic framework through which to ensure this multi-faceted energy transition can remain on the rails. I put the slide up in my talk at Clean Energy Summit but have since been wondering whether the distribution of representation is not a normal distribution, but whether there are disproportionately large numbers of people at both ends. Certainly there’s a loud volume emanating from the shouting match at the extremes. * as an aside, it seems to me that a prominent example of the “middle” position seems to be the consensus emerging amongst most representative groups involved in the energy sector for a (pragmatic) “certainty of energy policy” – with statements like this first seen sometime after the SA Blackout of 28th September : … and yet, it seems, our politicians (across all parties, state and federally) are not really hearing this message. Its these three factors, combined together, that have led me to the perspective that we, the voting public, are Villains #2 – in that we have presented an almost intractable problem to our current crop of politicians , who have repeatedly demonstrated that they are not up to the task (and hence are Villains #1).",

    "title": "Villain #1 – our Emperors (present, past and would-be) have no clothes",
    "date": "09-10-2017 09:54:00 AM",
    "content": "Common sense suggests that a central step in being able to fix a problem is identifying the root cause(s) of the failure in the first place. However, with the train wreck that’s unfolding before our very eyes (in relation to energy & climate policy) it seems like we’ve collectively been like deer in the headlight: 1) Firstly, collectively not even able to grasp the fact that the wheels were coming off our electricity-driven engine; and 2) Then when we (very belatedly) starting awaking to the slumber, we still seem to be incapable of stepping back to sort through the myriad of symptoms to get back to root causes. (A) Trigger events As I write this today, I am forced to wonder (yet again) why it took the South Australian state-wide blackout of 28th September (and also the death of Matt Zema) to trigger an awareness across the broader energy sector that how we were managing our energy transition just was not working, and baby steps towards a better way forward. Yet even after these two events, a real solution to this crisis seems very elusive… (B) A consistent message is emerging? What began as a few drips more than a year ago has become a torrent of exasperation (but, thankfully, what is a a single core message – albeit at a high level): Coincident with the AFR’s National Energy Summit in Sydney today and tomorrow , we’re greeted by the key message “Most AFR readers blame party politics for energy mess ” in the AFR online this morning : I wasn’t in the survey, but I do agree with the message as noted here . Here’s some other examples in recent weeks: 23rd August On 23rd August, Tom Parry wrote this opinion piece in the AFR making the point that there has been 20 years of bipartisan federal-state failure . 1st September In these comments in the SMH on 1st September, Michael Pascoe notes: “If you want some clarity about our energy crisis, stay away from politicians and the climate change battle still being waged by the lunatic fringe . Instead, check with the risk managers – the people who have the job of mitigating and insuring against the risks faced by corporate Australia.“ It’s a sad day, indeed, when wise advice is that we should ignore our politicians (our elected should-be-leaders), isn’t it? 5th September In this pearler of an article on 5th September in the AFR appropriately titled “Rude awakening for eyes wide shut NEM policy makers” , Ben Potter notes: “We knew our energy policymakers were asleep at the wheel for a decade until September 28 last year, when South Australia suffered a state-wide blackout. The Australian Energy Market Operator’s advice to the federal government on dispatchable power supply tells us just how asleep they were.” Unfortunately, my sense is that (until very, very recently) the “we” who knew our energy policy makers were asleep at the wheel and were speaking loudly about it was a very small number indeed. 6th September An opinion piece in the Australian on 6th September by Sid Maher summed it up in the title “Electricity crisis born of broken politics” . In this Editorial in the Fin Review “The power scramble has to end” , the editor is correct when he says: “But rebuilding an industry on the verge of failing, as the government has been warned once again, is not the same as more muddling through.” My sense is that we have been “muddling through” energy & climate policy for 10 years or more at State and Federal Level… 7th September According to this article from News Corp , Waleed Aly had a go at our current energy minister stating that “this is an abject failure of policy” . My sense is that Waleed is both: 1) correct, in that the root cause of the failure was policy, but also 2) incorrect in (my inference) sheeting home this failure to just the current Government, and current Energy Minister (and just to the Federal Government). Also on 7th September, Innes Wilcox of the AI Group is reported here as calling for policy certainty (in an article quoting a $9b hit for business in electricity and gas cost escalation – truly a train wreck in motion that’s flattening energy users in its path ). Again on Thursday 7th September, Kane Thornton (CEO of the CEC) is quoted in this article in the Australian as saying: “A decade-long political debate has created a policy vacuum and spooked investors… We need to accept that the energy system is in transition and long-term policy is now essential.” { nice referencing of our RenewEconomy sponsored NEM-Watch Widget in that article , by the way} 8th September A day later we see this article in the Australian report comments made by our PM-in-waiting Bill Shorten claim that it was due to privatisation. The article says: “Mr Shorten used an ABC radio interview to argue that the privatisation of electricity assets in the 1990s had seen the nation lose control of prices and to claim that a “ruthless pursuit of profits’’ by energy companies was hurting the nation. “There is no doubt that privatisation has been a big problem and I think the debate in Australia needs to recognise that,’’ he said.” As noted before in terms of wholesale prices , that’s an incorrect reading of the past 20 years . More generally, this seems just one more example of politicians not really understanding, or accepting, how integrally culpable they all are (e.g. pointing the finger the other way instead). 12th September After a few days of “the Government versus AGL” Jennifer Hewitt wrote : “The chasm between business and politics is spectacularly obvious in the plaintive calls from the power industry for bipartisan energy policy. Chief executives are wasting their time. Not only will bipartisanship not happen, Malcolm Turnbull’s far bigger problem is getting partisan agreement – from his own party.” On the same day, Richard McIndoe wrote : “It’s abundantly clear that the absence of a coherent national energy and climate policy has delivered us to a point where energy costs have soared while energy security and reliability have plummeted. All this without any real inroads to reducing the CO₂ emissions from the sector.” 14th September As another exasperated onlooker, John Hewson wrote in the Guardian here that : “… neither the government, nor the opposition, has yet produced a believable and deliverable energy policy. That is, a policy to specify the path forward to a low-carbon society, demonstrating a genuine capacity to lower power prices and to guarantee supply..” 30th September Alan Kohler has a way with words, but a particular line at the end of this article made me sit back : “That 2009 piece of Greens’ idiocy started it all. Eight years later, everybody is still arguing and blaming; soaring gas and electricity prices are threatening recession; and gas producers are having a lovely time, apart from the minor inconvenience of having to schlep to Canberra every other week so there can be a prime ministerial press conference.” He was, of course, talking about the Greens decision to block Kevin Rudd’s CPRS scheme. It’s one of the few mentions that that fateful decision has gained in the media (that I have seen). 6th October On 6th October, the AFR published this useful chronology of some aspects of the unfolding energy crisis. On the same day, three journalists at the AFR here note “five acts” that explain the energy crisis . Ben Potter also notes here that: “Chronic indecision around energy policy is bad for energy producers and consumers alike. To restore investment certainty, the nation’s politicians need to join the rest of the country and back the blueprint laid out by Chief Scientist Alan Finkel, the Australian Energy Market Operator, CSIRO and virtually every energy company. ” Don’t hold your breath waiting for that one, though! 8th October Finally, in yesterday’s article in the AFR , Mark Ludlow notes that: “Almost nine out of 10 business leaders say partisan politics is to blame for the energy crisis and that the Coalition and Labor need to find a way to end a decade of inaction on climate policy, according to a survey by The Australian Financial Review. ” He was, of course, talking about the Greens decision to block Kevin Rudd’s CPRS scheme. (C) Our politicians have failed us for 10+ years – and are still failing us Take your pick, really. It would be a long, long list of energy sector villains if we were to individually list all of those politicians who have been involved in helping our train run off the rails. Taken collectively, our politicians really do stand out as Villain #1 . Warren Buffet is often quotes as saying something along the lines of “it’s only when the tide goes out that we find out who has been swimming naked” (in reference to investment strategies). Well, as I noted in the title above: 1) Our Emperors (present, past, and alternate) have been seen by all to have no clothes ; and yet 2) Don’t really (even still) show much sign of acknowledging that this is the case. To put it another way – I really do have to scratch my head to recall a single politician (particularly an Energy Minister) who has actually inspired any confidence in me that they can manage this transition. I flag one particular episode here to illustrate – I was particularly gobsmacked with Phillip Coorey’s article “No more energy deals with the greens: Labor” on the AFR on 4th September , where the author writes: “Labor says it could never do another deal with the Greens on energy because any new policy must be durable enough to survive a change of government so it can guarantee investment certainty.” … so far, so good I think ( not because they won’t do a deal with the Greens, but because it seems to suggest that Labor understands the need for durability ). The article goes on: “But shadow energy minister Mark Butler stressed the investment strike in the energy sector, which was driving up prices and increasing supply volatility, would continue so long as the major parties continued to disagree.” Again, encouraging – but then here’s the quote: “ ‘All stakeholders have advised Labor that a bipartisan approach to national energy policy is crucial,’ Mr Butler told The Australian Financial Review.” Say what? Did you need to be advised of something so basic as this in order to join the dots? Gives me no confidence Mark actually understand some of the fundamental drivers that are behind this train wreck. I highlight this not particularly because it relates to Mark, but moreso because many politicians seem to still view (despite all the evidence) that they can use some permutation of energy policy for political gain . And that’s the root cause… though, as noted here [LINK TO COME] there seems to be a corresponding reason why this is the case. As I noted in my presentation back at the Clean Energy Summit on 19th June , I have a very pessimistic view that we are really going to see a change in the approach taken by our (supposed) policy makers any time soon…",

    "date": "09-10-2017 09:32:00 AM",
    "content": "It’s become increasingly commonly noted that we’re suffering from a real crisis in the Australian domestic energy sector . Back on 20th July I posted about the “train wreck” of a crisis that has befallen us (which followed my presentation at Clean Energy Summit on the same topic). I used this image to identify the four key characters in this unfolding drama: The Energy Crisis that’s upon us: (a) has not crept up on us silently (I. along with others, have been pointing out leading indicators for years), (b) nor has it suddenly emerged . Rather, it’s been through a combination of factors that it has emerged. Perhaps all of these factors could (and should) have been seen in advance? In my simplified depiction above, there are only four characters shown Character #1 = the “Hapless Victim” On 18th August I had some time to post about how energy users are the victims in this train wreck that is escalating before our eyes. Character #2 = the 10 Villains Today and tomorrow, the AFR are running their “National Energy Summit” in Sydney . I imagine that there will be much discussion about this energy crisis over the two day period – both amongst people present, and also online. This kind of discussion has been running for quite some time (more than occasionally devolving into a counterproductive “blame game”). 1) On 25th September in the SMH Ross Gittins describes the situation in an article titled “Everyone has a different excuse for the electricity stuff-up” . In my view it would have been more correct to stop thinking of them as “excuses” and start thinking of them as “causes” (i.e. to help reinforce that they are real). 2) Back on 14th March, Matthew Warren urged a focus on causes not symptoms . More recently, on 26th September in this article in the AFR Matthew notes “After debating about how to run it for more than a decade, the giant machine that provides electricity to the east coast of Australia continues to slowly degrade. Higher prices are a market signalling supply shortages. The threat of blackouts is the next logical warning of what happens when we manage to argue about a problem for so long without doing anything. Remarkably, while one of the fundamental systems needed to run the economy falters, we remain trapped in an ideological debate about how to fix it; the merits of different fuel types, the nature of policy risk, climate change and even how much life is left in old power stations. ” 3) Further back on 26th February, Ben Potter mentioned nebulous “vested interests” as part of the problem. 4) On 12th March, Brian Toohey wrote about at market rules as a “hidden cause” of the crisis . 5) On 10th March, David Leitch wrote about (confused) structure and accountability . 6) Back on March 13th the (now former) CEO of the Minerals Council, Brendan Pearson wrote about a level playing field (notwithstanding that talk about “privatising profits whilst socialising costs” has many angles ). 7) Back on 10th March, without a note of irony, the Clean Energy Council called for stable policy and accelerating reform . 8) Back on 20th February, Greg Houston (from Houston Kemp) advocated 5 fixes for the NEM. 9) On 14th February, Tony Wood talked about lack of integrated climate and energy policy (one of many times this continues to be mentioned). More recently, on 26th September in this article in the AFR Tony notes “Australian homes and businesses need governments and the energy industry to deliver secure and affordable electricity, over the next few summers and beyond. Yet the current government versus industry stand-off over domestic gas supply is a case study in apportioning blame instead of solving the problem ”. 10) On 16th February, Keith Orchison talked about the National Electricity Objective . 11) Also on 20th February, Mark Christensen talked here about privatisation . 12) Bruce Mountain called for devolution back to the states (and here talks about a crisis of good governance ). … and on and on it goes… My sense own sense is that we’re scrambling for “solutions” without really getting down to “Root Causes” , which seems a recipe for not really reaching a durable, long-term resolution. I have identified 10 Root Causes (or Villains) that will be progressively expanded on in the table below: Villain #1 Any objective review of the collective performance of our group of politicians over the last 10+ years would return the result of “Fail” . Our current, past, and prospective leaders all stand out, head and shoulders, as the grand architects of the current energy fiasco: 1) I’m not singling out any particular party – as Labor, Liberal, Green and “None of the Above” have all contributed in major ways. 2) I am also not singling out State or Federal pollies – in my view, they have all been pretty rotten at really grasping what’s necessary in this complex energy transition . I’ve discussed this more here today . Villain #2 However our elected representatives aren’t featured alone on the “wall of shame”. As posted on Wednesday 11th October , it’s clear to me that we, the voting public , have been collectively presenting an almost intractable problem our political leaders (both state and federal, across all parties). That’s why we’re Villain #2. Villain #3 Had to wait until 22nd January 2018 to post in those at both extremes of the Emotion-o-Meter as Villians #3. Villain #4 On 20th July 2018, I posted about how we’re seeing a yawning gap open up between current capacity, and requirement for “Energy Literacy” as one thing standing in our way of a smooth energy transition. Feedback from many others since this time has suggested that many others have been observing the same thing . Villain #5 On 9th October 2018, I posted about the way we sometimes don’t take the first step of correctly defining the problem we’re trying to solve as something that ends up with us heading down the wrong path to a solution. Villain #6 On November 8th 2018 I posted this article, about a tendency to reach for a “magic wand” as Villain no 6 in this looming energy transition train wreck. A bit like Angus Taylor’s “big stick”, with with added magic attached. Villain #7 On 9th March 2020 I posted an article about Villain no 7 ( the form of support we’ve used for Wind and Solar developments). I asked whether ‘ we’ve been killing new entrants with kindness? ‘ . Villain #8 On 21st June 2021 I wrote about how ‘the Invisible Man’ was seen as Villain no 8. Note that this villain is seen in a number of different manifestations! Villain #9 Still to find time to post about Villain #9…. Villain #10 Still to find time to post about Villain #10…. I look forward to hearing your thoughts about the above, as the matrix above is developed… Character #3) The means of destruction I’ve used the train to illustrate the means of destruction for we, the energy user (and victim). I’ll discuss more here what this means Character #4) The “superhero” saviour Many simplified stories have the superhero included, to fly in and save the day. I am wondering if such a character exists in the energy policy train wreck drama, and will post more about this later.",

    "title": "Here’s two odd examples being used in attempt to justify a claim of why privatisation will lead to higher spot prices",
    "date": "03-10-2017 02:10:00 PM",
    "content": "With the increased angst about all sorts of perverse outcomes (both real, and perceived in error) arising from this badly-managed energy transition increasingly bouncing back-and-forth in traditional/new media, we are trying to read as widely as possible. On Saturday 30th September I read an opinion piece titled “Opinion – Privatisation of public assets can come at a cost – like higher power prices” by Paul Syvret in the Courier Mail – which surprised me in a number of ways, including: 1) That it was published in a News Corp publication (whereas it would have been more expected had it been published by the ETU, as I’ve already written about here ); and 2) That it was written by Paul Syvret, who has seemed to have been one of the more considered journalists I’ve read in the Courier Mail. Paul’s main claim is that on many occasions privatisation is, on balance, the better option – but that … “when it comes to state-owned assets that provide essential public services or are a natural monopoly or near-monopoly, the magic achieved by Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” is less compelling.” (A) Paul’s odd choice of examples I can understand someone making an argument (on either “side”) about whether we would have been better off without privatisation in the generation sector of the NEM – ultimately this devolves to a discussion about different subjective points of view, because of the insurmountable problem of knowing (as distinct from having a view on) “what would otherwise have been” . There’s been an increasing amount of discussion going on (online and offline) over the past 12 months and more as it has become increasingly clear that we’re in the midst of a pretty big train wreck in the energy sector . Ordinarily I would just let it pass by. However what made me take a second look at the author’s arguments were two particularly odd examples to illustrate his point: Odd Example #1 = had NSW Government (via MacGen) still owned Liddell, the outcome might be less fraught To provide this example, the author does implore his readers to “Park the often ideologically tainted bickering about renewables, climate change and emissions targets to one side for a moment (although these factors are important, even in the absence of any cogent national energy policy).” – though I know that this will be an impossible task for many of his readers (and also those of WattClarity at both ends of the Emotion-o-Meter , who seem to see everything through this single frame of reference) . Paul’s point is that “When you retain strategic assets in public hands, you can take a different approach and, if Macquarie Generation was still state owned, the Liddell debate might (arguably) be less fraught.” Note that I’m not sure whether Paul is actually suggesting that a Government-owned MacGen might have decided to extend the life of Liddell, but I’m pretty sure that a number of readers of his article will conclude: 1. That this would have been the outcome; and 2. That this is what the author was implying; and 3. That this would have been a more desirable outcome – again, leaving aside concerns about renewables, climate change and emissions targets. In this hypothetical exercise, let’s also leave aside the fact that MacGen was not owned by the Federal Government (which is the one that wants to keep Liddell open) but by the NSW State Government (which, though LNP, is not exactly seeing eye-to-eye with their Federal cousins in terms of the way to manage this energy transition). Let’s say that the Feds (as hypothetical owner) did make the call to extend the life of the station. Even if we leave aside (which we can’t) considerations of climate change and the risks of investing capital into coal-fired generation, there must be an open question about whether it would have been a wise decision? We just have to look across to the other side of Australia to the claims of government waste by a short-lived refurbishment and life extension of similarly aged Muja A and Muja B power stations to see a counterposing example of where the Government (it’s now claimed) made an unwise investment in arguably similar circumstances. See one of today’s other articles (here) for more discussion on this comparison . The similarities (at least in some respects) between the two cases does call into question whether it would actually be a good decision for any owner (private sector, or Government) to extend the life of the Liddell asset. I do wonder why the particular example of Liddell was chosen to illustrate why Government ownership might be a good thing? Surely there would be less fraught examples to use? Perhaps one of our readers who understands more than I do can help me with this one? Odd Example #2 = QLD Government direction to GOC (Stanwell) to change bidding practices has reduced wholesale price outcomes in QLD Paul also notes “Queensland Treasurer Curtis Pitt responded to soaring power prices in June by directing state-owned generators to change their bidding practices in the national electricity market” . I posted this initial view on 6th June (a day after the announcement was made) to show that futures prices had reduced immediately following, and probably due to, the announcement. Hence the government has some basis in claiming some credit that its direction to Stanwell has lowered wholesale price outcomes. I’ve updated that view in the following chart from NEMreview v7 that puts the effect of the announcement into some perspective: Some might read, in this chart, that the effect of the Government announcement was a short-lived blip, with the futures prices returning to prior trends pretty quickly – however understand that these will always be subjective calls, based on the impossibility of knowing “what would have otherwise been” . However, a bigger issue seems to be that the Government can hardly claim credit for the effect it’s been able to have on reducing wholesale prices in the Queensland Region of the NEM through its direction towards Stanwell Corp without also accepting responsibility for: 1) the higher market concentration that resulted from the Government’s directed 3-into-2 merger of Queensland GOCs back in July 2011; and 2) the effect this had on generator market power, and hence to achieve control of prices (that same control that the Government has recently used to effect a small reduction) for the 6 year period since that time. In my view, it’s a bit rich for the same Government to be claiming credit for reducing prices, when only 2 years earlier there had been announced plans to merge 2-into-1, which would have had a ballistic effect on wholesale prices. I’ve linked here a fuller context to the history of Government involvement in Queensland’s generation sector that should be taken into consideration when determining the upsides and the downsides of Government ownership of generation assets. Again, I don’t understand why such an obviously flawed example was used? (B) Conflating two coincident, but separate, changes More generally, I’d also like to flag that two separate questions seem to be conflated together quite commonly: Q1 = should there be a market, or not? Q2 = should assets be owned by the Government, or by the private sector? They are not the same question – though they are partially related. Since the NEM began operations at the end of 1998, various Governments have continued to own generation assets (through Government Owned Corporations) and have been able to compete on that basis, fairly successfully. When “the NEM is broken” argument [LINK TO COME] surfaces, as we’re seeing a number of times (and have seen for almost 20 years), I do try to understand more of the detail behind that particular stakeholder’s perspective. It might be a perspective that stems from either of the questions above, or from something else.",

    "title": "A selected (and evolving) chronology of the QLD Government’s involvement in the QLD Generation sector",
    "date": "03-10-2017 12:56:00 PM",
    "content": "Government involvement in the electricity supply sector has been (for at least 30 years) something fairly topical – with sound arguments being mounted both for, and against, this situation. Given I’ve been based in Queensland whilst working in the Australian Electricity Supply Industry for a number of decades, it’s easier for me to compile a history of key milestones along the journey of Government involvement. My sense is that this is something I’ll be referring to a number of times (in addition to this article today ) – hence I have separated it out into its own post. 1) Trended prices Powering up NEM-Review v6 , I’ve produced the following longer-run trend of Queensland region outcomes since January 1999 (to September 2017), and included a couple particular annotations: For clarity, I have highlighted the 24-month period of the carbon tax , and also the period in which generation supplies nationally were affected by the NEM-wide drought of 2007. 2) A chronological record, including external links at key dates In the following table, we’ve tried to link to include a number of the key pieces of historical record in order to provide a more objective record of how the Queensland Government involvement in the energy sector has progressed: YEAR MONTH KEY EVENT 1994 March or April? A consortium including Comalco and others purchased the Gladstone Power Station from the QLD Government (via the Queensland Electricity Commission). Part of the sale arrangement included specific dispatch rights at the Gladstone station. 1997 ?? The Queensland Transmission Supply Corporation (QTSC), acting for the QLD Government, signed power purchase agreements with private sector players for the development of three peaking power stations – Oakey, Mt Stuart and Yabulu peaking generators. 1998 January Queensland Interim Market started, prior to the initiation of the NEM December Operations of the National Electricity Market begins, with QLD still islanded from the rest of the NEM. 1999 January The time-weighted average price for the month of January 1999 was $99.70 – just below the $100 mark, as seen in the chart above. 2000 January The time-weighted average price for the month of January 2000 was $102.20/MWh – as seen in the chart above. April Directlink operations begin (a little behind schedule), interconnecting QLD to the southern NEM (via DC) for the first time. ??? The QLD Government 13% gas scheme announced. 2001 January QNI operations begin, interconnecting QLD to the rest of the NEM with an AC link for the first time. Being a larger link, it has more impact in reducing prices, and price volatility. February Callide C unit 1 begins operation (with the unit 2 operational before the end of the year). This was built as an unincorporated joint venture between the QLD Government (through CS Energy) and the private sector (via Intergen). 2002 May Swanbank E begins operations. This was built by the QLD Government (through CS Energy) but I can’t recall if there was a private sector player initially involved? November Tarong North begins operations. This was built as an unincorporated joint venture between the QLD Government (through Tarong Energy) and the private sector (via TEPCO I think). 2003 . 2004 . 2005 January The QLD Government 13% Gas Scheme began operations – requiring Queensland retailers to ensure procurement of certain percentages of gas-fired electricity. 2006 . 2007 May Kogan Creek begins operations. It was developed by the QLD Government (through CS Energy) but I can’t recall if there was a private sector player initially involved? Also in May was the 4-into-3 merger . Enertrade was dissolved, with the various PPAs (and dispatch rights) that it managed were transferred to the three remaining generators (Stanwell, CS Energy and Tarong). June The time-weighted average price for the month of June 2007 was $192.45/MWh – as seen in the chart above. As shown on the chart above, the drought had a significant causal relationship (it affected power supplies in Queensland but also around the southern regions as well). Winter 2007 did see a shortage of available capacity across the NEM . 2008 February The time-weighted average price for the month of February 2011 was $131.11/MWh – as seen in the chart above. Particularly noteworthy was the weekend of 22nd and 23rd February, where a rare hot spell saw demand levels up and 5 hours of prices above $2,000/MWh as a result . Incidentally, it was bidding behaviour over this weekend at Stanwell Corporation called into question in the case of Australian Energy Regulator v Stanwell Corporation Limited (which the AER subsequently lost, but which has flowed on through to more recent changes in the rules). 2009 2010 25th November This “Shareholder Review of Queensland Government Government Owned Corporations” was published. 2011 February The time-weighted average price for the month of February 2011 was $105.66/MWh – as seen in the chart above. 10th March ON 10th March, the Finance Minister in the Bligh Labor Government provided this statement on the asset allocation. This noted a slight change in the asset allocation compared with what was suggested in the Shareholder Review (Nov 2010, above). July 3-into-2 merger Tarong Energy Corporation was dissolved, and the assets subsumed into the 2 remaining GOCs, Stanwell Corporation and CS Energy. 2012 July The 2 year long carbon tax period commenced, adding approximately $23/MWh to trading prices at every trading period. 2013 January Summer 2012-13 was a massive one, in terms of spot price volatility (layered on top of the uplift from the carbon tax). The time-weighted average price for the month of January 2013 was $155.90/MWh . On WattClarity we posted numerous articles analysing aspects of the volatility including: 1) This article looking at volatility over Saturday 12th and Sunday 13th January 2013 , which followed this earlier note ; 2) Volatility through summer 2012-13 was so severe that we prepared a detailed 100+ page report that examined this in detail . Note the reduced price for those who would still like a copy at this point. 2014 July First month without the carbon tax, though it took longer to wind out of the wholesale market completely because of the effect of hedging. December Summer 2014-15 saw very high prices leading into the election on 31st January 2015. Time-weighted average prices for the months of December 2014, January 2015 and March 2015 were all above $100/MWh – as seen in the chart above. 2015 31st January The Palaszczuk Labor Government is elected into power, defeating the Newman LNP Government. Electricity sector policy had been a hot-button issue during the campaign with: 1) The LNP campaigning for privatisation of Stanwell and CS Energy; and 2) Labor pledging to keep the GOCs in government ownership, with instead a plan announced to merge 2-into-1 with the intention of saving part of $150M p.a. in overheads as a result (i.e. with the main share of the savings coming from the mooted merger of the three network companies). Following the election win, there was much discussion (behind closed doors and in the press) aimed at helping the new Labor Government understand how the proposed 2-into-1 merger would light a rocket under wholesale prices. There’s this note from the Courier Mail on 19th March , for instance quoting the ACCC chairman: ”THE head of the nation’s competition watchdog says he has grave concerns over the Palaszczuk Government’s plans to merge the state’s coal-fired generators, warning it could drive up power prices” The article also notes the criticism of the LNP’s plan to privatise them as only 2 companies: “I said do not privatise the two, go back to the three. We know we can because for a long time we had Stanwell, CS Energy and Tarong. We know we can have three generators and I think that would be the better structure.” As a result of this, interest progressively waned, as reported here in the AFR on 21st October . December I’ve just found this article in the AFR from 14th December “QLD energy genco merger to be scrapped” with the article noting: ”But the merger of CS Energy and Stanwell Corporation will be dumped after serious concerns were raised by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission about a lack of competition in the state’s electricity generation sector” The article also notes: ”In a further move to try and shore up the state’s budgetary position after abandoning $37 billion in asset sales, the Palasczuk government will proceed to load up its government-owned corporations…with more debt” I’ve also just found this undated note on the Parliamentary website that notes the decision that: ”The generation businesses will remain as separate businesses. The Queensland Government will undertake a strategic review of the businesses to identify further efficiency opportunities” So the plan to merge 2-into-1 was squashed , but no move was made to de-merge 2-back-into-3 . 2016 February The time-weighted average price for the month of February was $121.31/MWh , which was more than double the outcome for December and January. July On 4th July I posted this review of Q2 prices for all years including 2016 (just passed) and questioned whether it was a systemic change in pricing patterns. 2017 January Summer 2016-17 saw astronomical prices in QLD, as seen in the chart above. The time-weighted average price in Queensland for the month of January was $197.65/MWh . I labelled Saturday 14th January “sizzling Saturday” because of the extremes in temperature, hence high demand and prices that resulted. A few days later I posted this more forensic look at Queensland Price Volatility on the day. This post included an animation that looked in detail (dispatch interval by dispatch interval) at generator bidding through the period. February Price outcomes were even worse for the month of February (where the time-weighted average price was $239.59/MWh for the whole month ). July On 6th July I posted this updated review of Q2 prices taking into account the extremes experienced across all regions in 2017. On 11th July on WattClarity, I highlighted the 3 big reasons why wholesale power prices were higher in Queensland than they used to be (including the 3-into-2 merger). I’d be happy to add in references to other key events in this table, if you can point them out to me (offline or online).",

    "title": "Comparison between Liddell Power Station (in NSW) with Muja A&B Power Station (in WA)",
    "date": "03-10-2017 10:40:00 AM",
    "content": "I’ve seen and heard this comparison made by others in the past month or two, given all the brouhaha about “will it, or won’t it – should it, or shouldn’t it” close with respect to Liddell Power Station. Given that we’re starting to increase the attention we place on the South-Western Interconnected System (SWIS) of Western Australia, I’ve had a preliminary look at what we might see in some data, by way of comparison: 1) What we can see in the data for Liddell Power Station One of the common comments in the media has been that Liddell has not been operating as heavily in recent times – due to a combination of different factors (including technical issues with an ageing plant, higher cost impacts, and more recently the availability of sufficient coal). Being part of the NEM, we’ve been working with data for Liddell Power Station since we began operations in 2000. Powering up NEM-Review v6 , I’ve produced the following longer-run trend of Liddell total output for each month since January 1999, and included a couple particular notes: There’s two things I’d like to highlight here: 1a) I’ve highlighted on the chart a period of the “middle years” when output at Liddell increased: (i) but that this dropped back to prior levels from around 2010 – with the decline in demand seen across the NEM from around that time presumably being one of the factors; (ii) from mid 2016 we see the pattern of output increase slightly; 1b) To the extent that AEMO published station available generation data, we have seen a consistent pattern through all the years where Liddell has run at reasonably steady Monthly Utilisation (note, for the casual reader, that this measure is not the same as capacity factor, which has clearly varied more significantly): (i) This can be seen clearly in the following trended utilisation factor, which shows operation in a fairly tight band between 80% and 90% over the majority of months since data is first available (Sept 2001) – but that this has dropped by more than 10% from July 2016 and stayed down for 15 months : (ii) In layman’s terms, it means that the station was run fairly consistently to the extent it was available up until July 2016 – where we can see (in the first chart) that the availability stepped up, but that this was not followed by as big an increase in output. 2) What we can see in the data we have for Muja Power Station As part of the development of the upgraded NEMreview v7 , we’re adding in a diverse range of additional data sets – including data for the South-West Interconnected System as noted here . Being a data junkie, and curious about the comparisons that have been made between Liddell and Muja, I had a quick look to see what could be seen: Unfortunately, the data we currently have available for use in NEMreview v7 only extends back to February 2015 (I have not checked but believe that’s probably a result of when we started development work to add aggregate WA data into the NEM-Watch Fuel Type Widget ). We are in the process of sourcing earlier data in order that we can fill out the record available for our NEMreview clients. Despite the relative lack of data, what the chart does show, however, is that: 2a) The four units from A and B station at Muja hare much smaller than the 4 units at Liddell (though the SWIS is also a smaller grid); and 2b) There are many months (in the 32 month range shown) where these older units have not run at all. Clearly Liddell is not in this position currently. It might be worth clarifying (in this excerpt lifted from our 2014 Issue “Power Supply Schematic” Market Map wall chart ) that the 8 units at Muja are effectively grouped into 4 stations – with A and B station containing the four smaller units (seen bumping around the bottom of the chart above) whilst C & D stations containing the younger and larger units (which are not scheduled for closure currently, I believe): Perhaps some of our readers in WA can shed more light? 3) Some of the recent commentary comparing and contrasting Muja AB and Liddell For those who like lists, I’ve seen this comparison in a range of places, including: Date Article 5th May In his article in Perth Now on 5th May “WA taxpayers foot huge bill for botched power project” , Daniel Mercer reports that: (a) The WA Energy Minister announced the closure of Muja A&B stations in September 2018. (b) The stations are around 52 years old (similar to Liddell) (c) The project was $160M over budget ($310M total cost) and 18 months late, due to technical and financial difficulties.This news was also reported in RenewEconomy and elsewhere. 8th September Frank Jotzo and Zeba Anjum posted an article “The true cost of keeping the Liddell power station open” in the Conversation . (a) As the authors there say, the situation does seem reversed to “normal” with the Government (a LNP one at that) seeing a more interventionist role in the market, to the point of actively considering purchase of the Liddell asset (and the Snowy ones as well). (b) The authors cite Muja as a case where refurbishment of an ageing plant is not easy – the costs can easily blow out, and the plant won’t experience longevity anyway.This article was then referenced in the ABC and elsewhere… 24th August Over at the Guardian in the article “Coal in decline: and energy industry on life support” , Adam Morton starts a long article with a summary of what happened in the Muja refurbishment. This article reports Muja will shut early 2018, so it seems the timetable is moving about a little. 13th September I noticed that Michael Bloch posted this article on Solar Quotes that referenced the troubles experienced with the Muja A&B stations . 21st September At the Guardian again, Simon Holmes a Court wrote an article “Energy policy would not be that hard if the government wasn’t hamstrung by ideologues” that also makes the same point: ”Propping up decrepit coal power stations is not an answer. WA’s Muja AB coal power station will shut this month, only two years since WA’s Barnett government spent $300m on a refurbishment . A federal lifeline to Liddell would no doubt repeat that colossal waste.” Feel free to let me know of other significant pieces, which I will add to the table above as time permits. Don’t have time for any more today…",

    "title": "Is the market, that wasn’t broken, now dead?",
    "date": "28-09-2017 03:18:00 PM",
    "content": "Thirty years ago the Australian energy companies were vertically integrated Government owned monopolies. In the early 1990’s Jeff Kennett and Alan Stockdale in Victoria led a charge to customer facing reform and privatisation that transformed the market, despite subsequent sales being more about Government coffers than reform. The SA distribution price hike to double the value of the poles and wires business is a distant but painful memory. Governments spent most of this time adding and subsidising market impacting measures. Queensland’s Gas Certificates to get a Gas station built preceded the REC’s, NGAC’s, VEEP’s and others. The retail sector has more regulations and requirements than one could poke a stick at. These subsidies have transformed the market. New assets’ value is related to the detail of the subsidy scheme, with little return from or incentives for reliable energy production, the hallmark of the sector’s contribution to an industrial democracy. The subsidy structure has emphasised energy production, therefore windfarms are located in areas uncorrelated with demand, rooftop solar schemes maximise energy production not capacity correlated with demand, and now solar farms will bloom in the landscape farming Government dollars not crops. Installed generation capacity has increased many times faster than demand, and with the vast bulk of the new generation dependant on capital subsidies for viability and dispatching at zero bid price. In the midst of this stygian muddle South Australia had a storm that damaged its infrastructure and, due to the protection systems on the wind farms that dominate SA’s supply, caused a whole-of-state system shutdown. As is well known, this has occurred as State Governments have adopted anti-gas drilling policies that have choked traditional and non-traditional supply sources, especially from what should be cheap plentiful onshore gas fields. As they did this, Australia developed enormous LPG export terminals hoovering up gas to fill Take or Pay contracts, sending domestic gas prices soaring. The Result. Commercial generators are pricing in massive uncertainty for industrial and domestic markets. Gas markets are short, so gas prices are equally high. The combination means Industrial customers facing unprecedented high energy prices (and querying the reliability of the product they are getting). The only thing darker and more distressing was the precarious state of politics, so that politicians have felt isolated and apprehensive. As a result they adopt their crisis mode: promise to fix things (irrespective of whether they have the power or wit to do so.) spend large licks of money on the same things other Governments are spending money on (less risk of standing out) regulate and pass laws to stop the things that are happening from happening. (To a person with a hammer, every problem is a nail) Is the market dead? This note started with the Government owned monopolies. The only thing worse than our current situation is to contemplate if this was all happening without the counter balance of the variety of private entities actually delivering power to the economy and arguing what should and could happen, rather than a set of bureaucrats & ministers free to add cost & complexity at whim. I think Energy Companies, widely defined, will have a very rough ride in the next 10 years. The market will however re-emerge. Governments will Continue to subsidize specific asset types irrespective of their impact on reliable supply. Directly invest in assets that will smash the market pricing. Mandate company actions that destroy private value Regulate retail prices Nothing lasts forever, this too will pass. Then what? Subsidised New Generation. Governments will continue to subsidize specific asset types irrespective of their impact on reliable supply. The hand wringing time has passed, there are too many rent seekers and zealots who will scream if the tap is turned off. There will therefore be zero priced energy sloshing around in the middle of the day when it is bright & windy, for the foreseeable future. This is the most significant change to energy market pricing since the introduction of coal stations that couldn’t be turned down overnight. That led to energy sloshing around overnight and low off-peak pricing. Over the next 3- 5 years the high-priced power (and capital return for generation assets) will be overnight – NOT during the peak. What risks will remain in peak hours? Big change. How will it affect your Company – portfolio mix, product pricing, asset management and asset procurement? Since residential load will switch from the high volume/high volatility being in the high price period to the high price period being a period of low volume and volatility will we see the nirvana of real fixed price residential energy products? Too bad about the resi’s that invested in solar to avoid peak pricing, tho. Direct Investment . The SA Government, for example, is building a suite of assets including a gas power station and batteries. Too much of the conceptual work will be done by a non–commercial bureaucracy and too quickly. Batteries, for example, will be the Desalination Plants of the late 2010’s, every State Government will build one, as quickly as possible and as big as possible. The rush will happen and the Governments will be left with a suite of assets that will lose money hand over fist – even without the peak-off-peak pricing switch above. 10 years from now Governments will sell the assets to market entities for the same reason they privatised in the first place. How do the Companies make that sale happen sooner? Mandated Actions . The Prime Minister asked AGL to sell Liddell. Politicians are like the really big kid in the primary playground and always get their own way. If they can’t beat you at marbles they just take them. What should AGL do? In my opinion – sell. Wrap the asset up in the old-style vesting contracts, sweep all the value back to AGL and sell it. Governments are worried about their survival; the reaction may be worse than the sale. Regulated Prices . There is a very long history of Governments (and bureaucrats) knowing better than the markets on price. Governments will re-regulate. Unfortunately for the customer, it is more profitable to deliver to a regulated market than an unregulated one. The larger Companies, will not resist re-regulation too fiercely, even with the ugly kid in the playground metaphor above. Two comments: The stock market will get very jittery. Analysts and investors get very nervous when Governments play with the value chain, and are likely to take a very negative view of the risks in the sector. This could significantly reduce the value of these Companies. At some point, the penny will drop that customers are better off in an unregulated market. Until then, regulation will leave niches for smaller entities to take profitable customers from the larger companies by cherry picking, data mining and a casual approach to the regulations. How do regulatory systems add value to a Company, and how does your regulatory advocacy work? It should be warning the political system that regulated markets are not customer centric. Will it?

    "title": "Using this train analogy to critique some recent developments with Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS)",
    "date": "28-09-2017 12:13:00 PM",
    "content": "In my first article on WattClarity today , I introduced the analogy of a very long train to help readers visualise some concepts central to operating an interconnected power system. I ended with a description of the Frequency Control ancillary services (FCAS) provided by the engines on the train. Having all engines in the train controlling the speed has several practical advantages. When load changes occur all of the engines respond together and share the impact. A common issue that occurs on power systems is when a single generator trips due to an internal breakdown. This scenario is easily dealt with when all remaining generators share the load between them; they simply increase their output slightly to compensate. At the opposite extreme, imagine what would happen if only one generator is able to respond to load changes, all other engines having their throttle locked in a constant position. If the one and only generator which is controlling frequency is tripped, the remaining train cannot respond to the change in load and will slow down until it comes to a halt ( in practice under frequency protection systems would operate and the generators would all trip like falling dominoes, or the system would settle at a lower frequency because the carriages apply less braking force). If it was some other generator then the one and only generator which can respond will have to respond in full, bad luck if it doesn’t have enough capacity. This is known as a lack of spinning reserve. 1) So the question is: – what would cause engines to have their throttles’ locked in a constant position, unable or unwilling to respond to changes in speed? One obvious case occurs when the engines are running at full power output. At full output they can’t give any more power so cannot respond to reductions in speed, however if the train was going too fast they can reduce their power to reduce the overall speed of the train. Another case occurs if the control system is simply switched off. There are sometimes sound engineering reasons to do this – e.g. If the control system was mal-operating or under test, but usually switching off control systems is not recommended for very good reasons. Would you drive a car if the brakes and accelerator were disabled? In the NEM we have effectively created a market for frequency control , like having a market for controlling the speed of our very long train. How does this work? Some engines in our metaphorical train run flat out and hence cannot increase their power output whereas others running at part load can. Normally all engines running at part load would be able to respond to increase or decreases in speed, and this was the case in the Pre-NEM system. However, after the NEM came into being, it was decided that frequency control should be dispatched by market mechanisms. In effect generators bid for the right to supply frequency control services and a market clearing house (AEMO) decides to accept or reject the offer based on price. In theory if the price is too high, than it could be deemed too expensive to accept the offer, and some system frequency control can be compromised. Another way system frequency control can be compromised is for no one to put in a bid, and hence it is entirely possible (in a laissez faire market) for frequency control to be removed entirely. There are safeguards to prevent this extreme situation to be avoided (I hope) – but the fact remains that the frequency control spot market adds a level of uncertainty to the control of an engineering parameter that is unhelpful at best, and is probably outright dangerous . 2) It is important to note that the FCAS market does not control system frequency. Allocating more money to the market does not improve frequency control. The governor and AGC control systems is the technology that regulates system frequency. The FCAS market is a spot market operating like the energy market on a 5 minute bidding period. So even if you know which generators are controlling frequency now; that could be change 5 minutes after. Economists will be able to provide what they consider to be good reasons for dispatching FCAS via a spot market, but the author of this article remains unconvinced by the various explanations that have been offered to date. Instead consider the engineering ramifications. We have a highly complex interconnected system as it is and we effectively decide which machines regulate frequency and which don’t via the random machinations of a spot market. If the system were a train imagine that sometimes the engine at the back of the train controls the speed, sometimes it’s the middle engine and sometimes it’s at the front of the train. If the connections between the different carriages of the train were solid and didn’t allow much inter-carriage movement than this might not matter too much, a bit like the difference in handling between a front wheel drive and a rear wheel drive car. 3) This metaphorical train is very long; the connections between carriages are less like solid couplings, more like long and weak springs. Accordingly changing which engines does the frequency control can have unpredictable results. E.g. there have already been incidents where the system has experienced slow power swing oscillations which appear to be due to control system interactions caused by poor selection of which generators supply frequency control. Being a long train it is important not just that the speed is controlled, but that the speed is controlled in such a way that oscillations between different parts of the train are kept under control. If the oscillations are too big the weaker connections (springs) between different parts of the train are liable to break – and then we end up with two or three trains instead of just one, and there is no guarantee that each train will control its speed correctly. At the beginning of this article I mentioned that poor power system understanding has resulted in poor policy decisions and arbitrary ad hoc technical rules. The various recent rulings on system Inertia is a good example of this. In effect various authorities have decided that it would be a good thing to place lower limits on the amount of inertia for new generation projects. In fact some economics minded but not necessarily engineering minded people even want to set up a spot market for inertia. Without looking too closely at the problem this seems like a good idea. In our train analogy the inertia equates to the mass of the locomotive, a heavier train is harder to accelerate or decelerate and therefore should be easier to keep at constant speed. 4) This simplistic view of a complex power system is misguided. Consider what would happen to a train connected together by long weak springs which has centres of mass which some rule makers have decided to keep as heavy as possible. Some event happens which causes a system transient, e.g. a generator trips, a power system fault occurs or someone accidentally pushes the wrong button. As a result a power system transient occurs which causes a ripple of acceleration/deceleration to propagate the full length of our very long train, like weights bouncing up and down connected together by springs. What would cause the springs to break? Or to put it another way, would you expect the spring to be more likely to break if the weight of the engines in the train were heavier or lighter? Those who have been following this discussion up until now will be able to easily see that the springs (which are analogous to transmission lines) are most likely to break when the engines are heavier. Does this sort of thing happen in real power systems? Yes, and a recent example was the blackout of South Australia. A loss of generation caused by tornados damaging several transmission lines within South Australia resulted in a power swing causing the loss of the weak transmission link to Victoria. If that link had stayed connected there would have been no black out. What could have prevented that link from breaking? Well lighter not heavier inertia in South Australia would have helped. The faults on the system caused it to bounce around a lot and a system with lighter inertia would have bounced with higher frequency oscillations, but they would also have calmed down a lot quicker. The idea is to reduce the stress placed on the weak interconnection to prevent it from tripping (breaking), therefore frequency control in the SA region, or tie line power control would have helped as well, unfortunately both was lacking on the day of the black out. Various commentators have focused on the rate of change of frequency after the trip of the interconnector and stated (quite correctly and accurately) that the rate of change could be reduced by increased inertia, then maybe a fraction of the system could have been saved by load shedding . In my view for the specific event in question once the interconnector tripped, that was it, the system blackout was unavoidable – but the trip of the interconnector could have been avoided had there been better automated system control before events got to that stage. 5) So where do we go from here? The power system is a complex beast, taken in its entirety it is the largest and most complex machine on the planet. It is also undergoing a profound transformation in that the traditional methods of generating power using high inertia rotating plant can also be achieved using zero inertia non-rotating plant. This means control of system frequency is more important than ever before, too important to be left to the vagaries of a poorly designed ancillary services market, and too important to be subjected to ad hoc rulings. Accordingly we will be proposing some rule changes to sort this issue out. We believe that a lighter inertia system, far from being the threat to system security that some people currently believe it is could actually make the system more reliable and secure. The changing power system has obvious ramifications for the need for continuous monitoring and updating of the system – but this should not be necessarily be seen as a threat, rather as an opportunity to make the power systems of the future more reliable and secure than ever before thought possible. 6) The accurate control of system frequency is key to achieving this. If you are interested in assisting in the drafting of the rule changes to the NEM please get in touch. If you disagree with any of the discussion above, please also get in touch. The aim is to put in place a robust scheme that delivers good system frequency control and improves power system security and reliability.

    "title": "Introducing a train analogy to explain Power Systems 101",
    "date": "28-09-2017 12:05:00 PM",
    "content": "(A) Strengths and weaknesses of Analogies Analogies are often useful. It is reasoning by analogies which have produced some of our most successful scientific theories. Isaac Newton compared planets with apples and came up with a theory of gravity. Albert Einstein conducted “thought experiments” of trains travelling close to the speed of light to come up with the theory of relativity. Of course analogies can also be misleading . It used to be believed that heavier objects fell faster than lighter objects because it was “obvious” that more force is needed to lift a heavy object. “Obviously” heavier objects have a greater affinity with the earth than lighter objects. However, so long as the analogy is not pushed too far, carefully chosen analogies are absolutely essential to improve and gain understanding of the physical world and this in turn is essential in order to avoid poor decisions when dealing with technology, and to communicate difficult concepts. Editor’s note – elsewhere on WattClarity Paul McArdle has noted that “a model’s just a model – it’s not reality (though some models might be useful)” . An analogy is a certain type of model. It is now becoming a cliché to state that our electrical power system is in a state of transition . Everyday our media contains stories of the energy system which has become the major political issue in recent times. There has been a lot of investment in intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind farms, solar technologies and energy storage devices such as batteries which have now been developed to such an extent that they produce cheaper power than newly installed fossil fuel sources can. However to do so the technical issues of power intermittency, frequency regulation, voltage control and system strength (fault level) have to solved. These latter issues, collectively lumped together in power systems parlance as “ancillary services” are not well understood by non-specialists a situation which can and has resulted in poor policy decisions and arbitrary technical rules. To give a proper explanation of these issues requires explanation of various technical concepts and more than a few mathematical equations, both areas that should be avoided in a blog post if you want to avoid alienating many of your readers. Accordingly this article will attempt to explain many of these concepts using analogies. However this comes with a warning, although I will attempt to be as conceptually as accurate as possible, the descriptions herein will necessarily be incomplete and experts will most likely be appalled by some of the simplifications which follow below. This is unavoidable, if you want a clear and accurate description of the technicalities it will require some detailed study and some considerable skill in STEM subjects, something that cannot be compressed into a single article. (B) Explaining “Power Systems 101” using the analogy of a very long train The analogy I have chosen is that of a very long train which consists of several engines and several carriages. The train engines represent the generators on a power system, the carriages represent the loads. Everything is coupled together in the train, as it is in a power system via transmission lines and transformers etc. The carriages have poor brakes fitted which are always on but which are not strong enough to stop the train. Releasing the brakes is equivalent to switching off a load, reapplying the brakes equivalent to switching on a load. The train engines jointly control the speed of the train just as generators jointly maintain the power system frequency. If one engine stops or reduces in power the other engines have to increase their power output to compensate the loss of power. The mass of the train combined with its speed is another name for its inertia. The engines are usually heavier than the carriages, and this is the case for power systems as well, generators usually (up until recently) have more inertia than loads. This is probably a lot to take in when reading it as prose, so here is a table to summarize: Train Analogy What this equates to, in Power Systems Engine (locomotive) Generator Carriage (with poor brakes applied) Load Carriage (with brakes released) Load switches off Speed of the train Power system frequency Throttle (speed control) Governor control system Mass of the whole train System inertia Mass of the engine Generator inertia The analogies can be pushed further: Advanced Train Analogy What this equates to, in Power Systems Transient Stability If an engine is decoupled from the train it will accelerate away from it because it does not have any carriages trying to hold it back. If you had a way of rapidly re-coupling it to the train before it got too far ahead, then everything would return to normal, otherwise the engine would escape (and probably crash!). In power systems the coupling is done by circuit breakers, “escaping” generators is known as pole slipping or transient instability, but if you can rapidly reconnect them before pole slipping occurs; the system is said to be transiently stable. Load shedding This one is easy, say you suddenly lost a large engine (i.e. it could have run out of fuel). The whole train would start to slow down so to avoid the whole train from slowing down you quickly decouple some carriages. They would slow to a stop, but the rest of the train would return to normal speed and keep going. Oscillatory (control system) stability With trains and generators it is possible to have poorly tuned speed (i.e. Frequency) control systems which become unstable (i.e. Start “hunting”). This is known as oscillatory instability which you can imagine as two engines trying to go at different speeds but can’t because they are coupled together (by springs!) but due to differing time delays in each control system can lead to power surges (oscillations) between the two (or more) engines. Voltage Control This analogy can be stretched to include power system voltage control (which is very important in power systems) but I won’t go into too much detail on voltage control in this article (maybe next time). To summarise, if you consider the couplings between train carriages and engines to be springs, the diameter of the spring is analogous to the power system voltage. Stretching the spring shrinks its diameter which is analogous to a reduction in power system voltage levels on transmission lines which occurs when power flows are high through parts of the network. The Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) Market We have a long train with several (> 500 ) large engines and several thousand carriages, all linked together with couplings. This gives some idea of the scale of the NEM which is actually relatively small by global standards (though spread out over a very large area). Controlling the speed of such a long train requires making sure all of the engines control to the same speed. This engineering problem was solved (on railway systems) even before electrical power systems were created. Basically the speed reference set point on every engine is adjusted downwards the faster they go; this reduces the power output which slows down the train. Eventually equilibrium is reached whereby all engines operate at exactly the same speed; and each engine shares the load reasonably evenly. All achieved with no high speed electronic communications between different generators. It is not quite that simple, the speed control systems need to be tuned to prevent control system oscillations (hunting), and it is natural that generators of different sizes to respond differently to changes in frequency (speed). E.g. larger units tend to be slower to respond than smaller units. However, subject to these technical details, the problem of managing the power system frequency was solved more than 150 years ago when several engines were first linked together to create trains of higher power, and then the technique was extended to electrical power systems. Editor’s note – elsewhere on WattClarity Jonathon Dyson has also provided this explanation of FCAS .

    "title": "September Update: More Regulation on the Retail Side",
    "date": "27-09-2017 02:13:00 PM",
    "content": "My September update follows this one for August . This month saw continued pricing concern, new applications for energy retail authorisations, and further interest about and proposed regulation of embedded networks. New Energy Retailers The number of entities with a retail authorisation or applying for a retail authorisation has continued to climb this month. Two new applications were published last week by the Australian Energy Regulator ( AER ), one for Zen Energy and the other Discover Energy. We see this as response to limitations imposed on participants who do not hold a retail authorisation, particularly those seeking to sell within embedded networks. There is also a perception that money can still be made in the retail game. New retail authorisation applicants are either specialised or are seeking to differentiate themselves from the large three in some other way. The two applicants from last week both came from a background in renewables: Retail Applicant Brief Overview Discover Energy Discover Energy , a client of ours, will be focused on solar offers . Discover Energy is owned by One Stop Warehouse , one of Australia’s largest solar and storage distribution companies. You can find the retail application here on the AER website . Note that submissions on this application are due by 20th October. ZEN Energy ZEN Energy is targeting large energy consumers . ZEN Energy is a well-known renewable company. According to its application, it has installed approximately 75MW of solar PV and battery storage systems across Australia. You can find the retail application here on the AER website . Note that submissions on this application are due by 18th October. ZEN Energy has been in the media in recent times, particularly as a result of Sanjeev Gupta’s purchase of a controlling stake in the company – with mentions in numerous places including: 1) Reported in the Australian on 20th September by Matt Chambers ; and 2) Reported in the AFR on 20th September by Simon Evans ; and 3) Reported in RenewEconomy on 20th September by Giles Parkinson . Embedded Networks We continue to see interest in embedded networks. Embedded networks can be very profitable and are getting the attention of ‘non-traditional’ players including building developers, owners and operators. These new players on-sell energy to occupants within embedded networks. The rise of embedded networks has been challenging for the existing regulatory framework and for regulators such as the AER. The Australian Energy Market Commission ( AEMC ) published its Draft Report on the Review of regulatory arrangements for embedded networks on 12 September, finding that: “the current regulatory framework for embedded networks is no longer fit for purpose and is resulting in some customers not being able to access competitive prices or important customer protections.” AEMC estimate that there are over 200,000 embedded network customers. AEMC found that: “embedded networks customers receive a lesser level of consumer protections and a limited monitoring and enforcement regime under the network service provider and retail exemption framework due to regulatory gaps, the growth in the numbers of embedded networks, and diversity in the capacity and resources of embedded network operators.” Recommendations in the draft report include: a. Mandatory registration and allocation of NMIs for all child connections where an Embedded Network Manager is appointed; b. Mandatory registration of embedded network operators with AEMO; c. Reducing the circumstances that would justify an exemption from the requirement to hold a retail authorisation; and d. Allowing the AER to exempt authorised on-sellers from particular provisions of the rules. If recommendations from the report are implemented we are going to see the most significant change to the licensing regime since the introduction of the National Energy Consumer Framework. The final AEMC report is due to be published on 28 November 2017.

    "title": "Why is wind production being curtailed (or “dispatched down”, more strictly speaking)?",
    "date": "17-09-2017 01:55:00 PM",
    "content": "On Friday I posted these initial estimates of 65,746 MWh being curtailed from wind farms across South Australia , equating to more than 6% of the aggregate capability of the wind farms over that period (i.e. the effective capacity – down from the installed capacity because of the amount of available wind). In Friday’s post I noted that I would provide this explanation – however have been unable to complete this article until today. Other linked posts will have to wait until later . It was inevitable that we would end up curtailing supplies from intermittent plant (such as the wind farms in SA over the past 8 weeks) when circumstances demanded. It also seems almost certain that the rate at which this occurs is likely to increase into the future – particularly if we continue with a certain set of policies* that are promoting this possibility by skewing incentives. * The effects of these policies are, I believe, particularly important to understand. I’ll post more about this later, and link in here…[LINK TO COME] 1) It might have emerged under either of two scenarios The emergence of (situational) curtailment of intermittent supplies was always just a matter of when and how much – it’s happening for wind now, and is highly likely to occur for solar, as well. It might occur under each of two general scenarios : Scenario #1) Spillage, when supply exceeds demand This scenario should be pretty obvious (and non-controversial): (a) The solar/wind harvest curve will never precisely match the demand shape for the contiguous NEM. (b) The NEM is also too far away from any other major energy consumption center to cost-effectively interconnect (hence we can’t rely on a “just make it bigger” approach possible in larger interconnected systems in Asia, North America and Europe, etc that can help to defer this challenge). As the installed capacity of “run whenever you like” plant increases, there will be a need to do something with the surplus energy. There’s essentially three things that could be done : (a) Spill the “surplus” generation (or “constrain down”, “dispatch down”, or whatever other terminology you like to choose); (b) Time-shift the production (i.e. through storage, assuming that the legacy “demand” shape does not change); or (c) Time-shift the legacy demand (e.g. by shifting when we consume to when it is extra sunny, or windy – for instance, by shifting “off peak hot water” to use it as a “solar sponge”). In this respect, I have been puzzling about the scale of the numbers involved. I performed some analysis about 2 years ago and posted here on WattClarity before talking at All Energy that year (now just 3 weeks away again), but have not had time to return to this (and update/expand) since that time. It seems that this form of spillage won’t be necessary in the NEM for years (depending on growth rate of new capacity, etc) but that it will be very tricky to deal with, and possibly quite expensive. Hence we really need to progress beyond “back of the envelope” calculations like mine quickly! I am interested to hear of others who are actually looking at real numbers, from a systems perspective, (i.e. beyond first principles (or the “add storage” magic wand ), and not just with respect to specific projects like the Kennedy solar/wind hub ) to work through the scale of the challenge – if you know of people I can speak with, please let me know? Scenario #2) Curtailment, when network conditions require this Even before scenario 1 emerges, however, there was always a good chance that there would be occasions when network (or market, or other) conditions would emerge where AEMO would be required to impose constraints on certain Semi-Scheduled plant in order to achieve outcomes like a more secure system, and so on… 1.2a) Currently, because of AEMO’s considerations system security Following the SA blackout of 28th September 2016 , a huge volume has been written. To help the interested observer, we’ve been compiling this listing of noteworthy analysis from various parties that has followed from this macabrely landmark event. Following from the event, AEMO has taken a more proactive role in managing system security (particularly in South Australia, given the higher penetration of intermittent supplies and other factors). 1.2b) How is this being done? As I noted in Friday’s post , since 19th July 2017 the approach used has been through the permanent use (officially the term is “Invocation”) of a particular constraint equation (named “S_WIND_1200_AUTO”) . I will also posted here [RUN OUT OF TIME, SORRY, LINK TO COME] this brief explainer on how constraints work within the “NEMDE” market dispatch process. 1.2c) Likely to see increasing amounts of this in future The main point to understand is that, if we assume the same constraint equation is used into the future, it is almost certain that the “energy foregone” is likely to increase into the future – given the new projects that are being developed for the South Australian region (and given the high degree of correlation of their outputs over time). 2) A prompt, to progress up the learning curve We’re all on this journey together, ourselves included (and a big thanks for those readers (and others) who are helping us continue in this journey). Occasionally we encounter prompts to remind us that we need to take the next big steps – for Semi-Scheduled generators, this curtailment is a big prompt . 2.1) “Grace Period” In this broader energy transition it has seemed that an important (but not commonly highlighted) objective has been to accelerate the entry of new entrants into the energy sector, both on the generation and retail side: 1) On the generation side, the advent of the Semi-Scheduled registration category has worked in conjunction with other incentive structures to make it easier** for new generators to get started – which is a good thing. 2) On the retail side we have seen a significant number of new retail licences being registered ( Guest author, Connor, posted about this in January 2015 – so it would be timely to update this report), and this has been on top of the rise of the Retail Exemption . (however retail is not he focus of this post) Semi-scheduled generators have been (by the nature of the Semi-Scheduled classification) effectively provided a grace period in which they have not needed to learn** a number of the nuances of the way in which the dispatch process works (i.e. to the extent that they would have had they been Scheduled). ** I’ll post more later [LINK TO COME] about this apparent deficit of learning (which has also been exacerbated by the nature of implemented policy). Whilst this speed-to-production has had some advantages (more MWh produced from renewable sources, keeping in mind the “what would have otherwise been” problem of course), it has has some intended consequences: (a) For generators this has led to a number of things: i. like difficulties in apportioning “Causer Pays” FCAS contributions (another big week recently), or big shock when receiving a very unexpected bill; and ii. surprise (and lack of understanding), when they find themselves being constrained down. It’s possible, for instance, that this is adding to different forms of conspiracy theories in the absence of fuller understanding. (b) on the retail side, it may have contributed to some of the financial difficulties experienced by some of the newer retailers (with 2 having gone bust in recent times, and rumours of others in trouble); 2.2) A signal that the “Grace Period” is ending If a new generator were to emerge (say a peaking plant) and register as a Scheduled Generator, then that generator would have a keen incentive to get themselves up to speed very quickly in terms of the nuances of the bidding and dispatch processes in the market – for they would find themselves being dispatched on every dispatch interval. Whilst one might raise questions about the specific merits of some of the logic in the “S_WIND_1200_AUTO” constraint equation , the broader point is that the NEM has become more complex for wind farmers than the more sheltered existence enjoyed beforehand. This wake-up call should prompt a desire to learn more about the fuller nature of dispatch and the environment the generator operates within. 3) Curtailment changes the economics of Semi-Scheduled projects (to some extent) One of the biggest realisations in this respect should be that the curtailment we’re seeing now changes the economics of Semi-Scheduled projects . I wonder how many of the current crop of proponents are realising this, and factoring into their business case – or are they just assuming unconstrained output forever into the future? On the revenue side of the equation, there are essentially the two variables: (a) There is the volume of production , which will clearly suffer in the case of curtailment (to the tune of 6% or so over the past 8 weeks in South Australia); (b) The other variable is the unit price for production – which is comprised of spot and contract, plus price for LGCs and so on…. (specifically with respect to the “black” component provided of the NEM spot market, I have already noted about the “wind correlation penalty” clearly apparent in South Australia , and this seems to be getting worse) . However it may not be all negative. If we are talking about a 6% reduction in volume from curtailment (but, at the same time, fewer prices down at –$1000/MWh because of wound-back output from wind farms), then the net financial position for the spot-exposed stakeholders of the wind farms may actually be improved. That’s all I have time for on a Sunday…",

    "title": "How much wind-powered electricity production has been curtailed in SA since these new constraints were invoked?",
    "date": "15-09-2017 01:32:00 PM",
    "content": "That’s a question we have been asked, on a number of fronts (and which we had been asking ourselves). So we’ve been doing a bit of digging, in amongst a number of other projects we’ll talk more about later . In doing this, we’ve been very conscious of the “what would otherwise have been” challenge that dogs any number of challenging questions facing the energy sector at present, and very much present in this one as well. Please take this into account in thinking through what’s posted before – and also the general “never enough hours in the day” challenge that leads to these posts not being as clear (or as short) as they should really be. 1) Production from intermittent supplies (wind) in SA is being curtailed Yesterday (Thursday 14th September) I posted this snapshot from our NEM-Watch entry level dashboard on social media (e.g. Twitter ) to highlight another occasion when a surplus of electricity production from wind and gas-fired plant in South Australia were combining to drive the price to the Market Price Floor of –$1,000/MWh: This occurred a number of times through the day, and was not really a surprise given the disproportionate* number of wind projects incentivised to build in SA over the past 10 years because of factors such as: 1. a more streamlined & stable planning process; and 2. a better wind resource – leading to forecasts* for higher (unconstrained) yield – hence: (a) better LGC revenues; and (b) assumptions of* better “black” revenue because of the historically higher “all hours” price in SA . * I have already posted about a “wind correlation penalty” suffered by wind farmers across South Australia (using Infigen as an example). Increasing curtailment will create a double-whammy (i.e. lower spot prices and lower volumes) that wind farmers in South Australia will suffer and probably did not factor into their business case for the project . I’ll post more on what I see the root causes of this and link in here later… The dispatch interval I caught above in real time was the 11:15 dispatch interval (so 10:45 in Adelaide). A little later in the day, I used the Time-Travel** feature in ez2view software to produce the following, more detailed view of what was happening within South Australia at the time: As noted on the snapshot of 11:15, there were constraints bound – but these were affecting flows east on Heywood (and other things), but not winding down output on the wind farms. A combination of the limitation of flow east and the high (unconstrained) wind production in SA drove prices down to the price floor. ** We’ve had a number of clients refer to ez2view as “ NEM-watch on steroids”, and we can understand why. In the “SA Schematic” widget above: 1) individual dots are units – they are coloured in if running, hollow if not. If subject to bound constraints, a “+” or “-“ symbol is shown (see the Heywood and Murraylink indicators) to show the sign of the LHS factor. Click through here [LINK TO COME] for a general explainer on how constraints work. 2) if we were looking at a prior Trading Day (or for clients pointed to their own MMS, including their Private Data in real time) the “$” symbols would light up to indicate a change in bids. In Time-Travel, the display reflects market conditions at that time, including market forecasts that existed at that time (e.g. the P5 and P30 predispatch forecasts shown here). At this (11:15) dispatch interval, a view of the Constraint Equation details widget for the “S_WIND_1200_AUTO” constraint shows that it was had a small headroom (i.e. was not bound, but close): However there were a number of other dispatch intervals through the day when the wind farms were constrained down – such as the sampled instance here of the 10:10 dispatch interval on the same day (note the title bar changes colour to help highlight a different point in time) : Winding the other currently opened ez2view window back to the 10:10 dispatch interval reveals the way in which the constrained output at displayed wind farms are displayed: A key point to note, here, is that the wind farms are producing less in the 2nd image (i.e. at 10:10) than they were in the first image (i.e. 11:15), and this is partly as a result of the AEMO curtailment. This reduced output has been one of the factors that will have contributed to a higher dispatch price in this second image. Sacrificing volume for a better price outcome (and hence better revenue) is something the other Scheduled Generators have long known about. 2) Wind farms are dispatchable!? It seems that “dispatchable” generation was one of the “terms of the week”, last week in the fishbowl that resembles the energy sector. (a) This has largely come off the back of the AEMO’s advice to the Government on “dispatchable capacity” released last week; (b) Full marks to the Government on actually seeking this sort of plain-speaking advice from the AEMO in the first place (and for the AEMO in writing something in plainer English that has a chance of cutting through the toxic fog of vitriol that’s emerged from the slanging match ping-ponging from both ends of the Emotion-o-meter ). (c) However F for “Fail” to the Government*** for dropping the perspective within a week and going back to tired old workhorse terms such as “baseload” that should surely be retired soon, along with the old power stations that the term was used to describe. *** Frequent readers will know that I have a very jaundiced view of the way in which the energy sector, and its vexed challenges, has been horribly let down by our political class for 10 years or longer. Those who attended my presentation at the Clean Energy Summit will understand a bit more. I will post more about this at a later date and link in here. I write this small tangent merely to point out (as was noted to me also) that the wind farms are technically “dispatchable”, to a certain degree, given that they have been dispatched down plenty of times in the past couple months. I suspect that AEMO had in mind a greater amount of controllability and regularity in their use of the term in the document linked above, however. The main take-away is that I (and others) might use three terms interchangeably – “constrained down”, “dispatched down”, and “curtailed”. 3) Why are wind farms being constrained (i.e. dispatched down)? Rather than get bogged down in more of an answer here in this post, I have published a brief linked post here that might start to answer that question . 4) How are they being constrained? Again, I’ll flag today that I will add in later a more focused explainer [LINK TO COME] and link to it here. In the meantime, some of the details above should help, to some extent. 5) How much wind product has been curtailed As noted above, there is always a “what would otherwise have been?” question that is inherent in any question of this nature. This is particularly tricky for wind production as (because of their “Semi-Scheduled” nature), they produce whatever they can, when they can, except when AEMO needs to wind them back through constraints like this one . Inherent in this is that it’s essentially AEMO that has ultimate responsibility for working out what the possible production from the wind farms might be capable of (though wind farmers are required to submit data to AEMO’s AWEFS system to help make this happen). Hence there is really some challenge in understanding what a wind farm might have been capable of delivering had it not been constrained – it’s not the volume the wind farm bid to the market, for instance, as the Semi-Scheduled arrangements allow them to effectively be a bit “lazy” in their bid volumes (i.e. putting the onus on the AEMO to work out what their “real” capability is). Hence it’s taken us a bit of grappling to come up with a logic what (we think) works reasonably well, though is certainly not perfect. If you contact me offline (tel +61 7 3368 4064), I’d be interested to explore your ideas for other potential methods of determining this? 5a) A trended view of curtailment We picked the 19th July to begin this analysis as it was on this day that the “S-SA_WIND_1200_AUTO” constraint set (containing the “S_WIND_1200_AUTO” constraint equation ) became effective – though note that this is a little arbitrary, as constrained output was happening on occasions before that (though June was a bad month, for other reasons ). With a 19th July start date, this meant that the 8 week “anniversary” passed on Wednesday 13th September. Given the questions we’ve received recently (and the fact that we’ve other things to focus on for a while), I thought it would be timely to review what’s happened. During this period: 31st July Here’s a brief post on 31st July I made about another instance of prices down at the price floor (but a reminder about high FCAS prices). 5th August I posted briefly on 5th August about one particular instance where outputs were constrained Other times There are a couple interesting incidents we know about that we might (if time permits) include as Case Studies and link in here. The effect of this particular constraint equation can be seen in the two trends superimposed on the one chart below – the green shows wind (actual output) whilst the grey shows an estimate of “what might have otherwise been”, except for the binding of that constraint equation: As noted a number of times before on WattClarity , output from aggregate wind has varied markedly – down to practically 0MW for a number of periods and up to almost 1,600MW (noting the peak of 1,540MW seen on 26th April ). 5b) Aggregate volume curtailed, over 8 weeks (from 19th July to 13th September) Summing up the area of the grey area visible in the chart (note that it’s not exactly a midnight-to-midnight range) above provides an approximation that there have been 65,746 MWh of possible wind production curtailed over an 8 week period. . 5c) Putting this curtailment into context This 65,746MWh of wind-powered electricity that could not be produced compares to other metrics for South Australia over the same period as shown in the following table: Data set Aggregate Volume Percentage SA Wind (what would otherwise have been) 1,073,611 MWh This averages to 799 MW constant output for 24 x 7 x 8 weeks. The wind curtailed represents 6.1% of this volume – not a trivial amount. SA Wind (actual) 1,007,865 MWh This averages to 750 MW constant output for 24 x 7 x 8 weeks – or, to put it another way. Or, to put it another way, the curtailment represents 49 MW of constant output (or a 140 MW wind farm at 35% capacity factor). The wind curtailed represents 6.5% of this volume. So production could have been 6.5% higher. SA “Operational Demand” volume I’LL COME BACK TO THIS AND UPDATE LATER TO BE ADDED Unfortunately that’s all I have time to post about today on this topic…",

    "title": "Decoding AEMO’s latest ESOO–will the lights stay on this summer?",
    "date": "07-09-2017 03:57:00 PM",
    "content": "AEMO has been busy. This week they have released three major documents dealing with the challenges of the energy transition: An Electricity Statement of Opportunities (ESOO) projecting reliability levels across the NEM over the next 10 years as the generation mix continues to change Advice to Commonwealth Government on Dispatchable Capability which builds on the ESOO and recommendations of the Finkel Report with further discussion of the types of resources and mechanisms that may be required to address NEM reliability and security issues South Australia System Strength Assessment dealing with the specific technical challenges of securely operating a grid with very high and variable levels of non-synchronous wind generation alongside a traditional fleet of synchronous gas-fired generating units In fact the ESOO brings with it a substantially updated set of NEM annual energy and maximum demand forecasts, superseding the Electricity Forecasting Insights projections published only a few months ago, so you could increase the count of AEMO’s major releases this week to four. There’s far too much in any one of these documents to analyse or summarise succinctly here (not that that has stopped any number of commentators, some less well-informed than others, from rushing to conclusions and headlines). I’m just going to focus on the ESOO document and specifically what AEMO is trying to say about reliability for the coming 2017-18 summer. What does “Unserved Energy” mean, and how is it measured? Readers might find this brief explainer I have written today “What does ‘Unserved Energy’ Actually Mean” of value in interpreting the ESOO, and the commentary following from the ESOO. Commentary following from the ESOO A lot of the commentary around the most recent ESOO arises from the fact that for coming summers in South Australia, Victoria, and later in NSW (after projected retirement of Liddell power station in mid-2022), AEMO is projecting USE values approaching or in some cases exceeding the reliability standard of 0.002%. This is summarised in the following chart from that document: (The coloured marks on this chart represent USE assessments under different assumptions – or scenarios – about key drivers like demand growth and new generation investments. These scenarios are distinct from the multiple simulation cases for lower level variables discussed in the “explainer” post , which are run and combined to determine the USE value for any given scenario) What doesn’t USE tell us? Going back to the roulette wheel example, by itself the expected return of ~$100 on a $100 bet doesn’t tell you what the chance of winning or losing is, or what you stand to win or lose on any roll – you need to know more about the game and its possible outcomes. AEMO’s USE values are the same. By themselves they don’t say how probable AEMO thinks load shedding is to occur, or what the extent of that load shedding might be if it does. However there are some statements in the ESOO (p. 18) that refer to this, for the coming summer: These numbers are a little difficult to reconcile with the USE measures published in the same document. Taking the Victorian example, the base case USE value is 0.0017% (s4.4.1 of the ESOO) or about 765 MWh. With the probability of any USE being quoted above at roughly 40%, then the average unserved energy in cases where it is non-zero should be 765 / 0.4 = 1,912 MWh. This is roughly twice the value obtained by combining the “likely” 218-229 MW and four to five hours duration stated by AEMO. On the other hand the modelling does not capture all factors that might change the likelihood of actual load shedding this summer. In particular, AEMO’s most recent ESOO explicitly doesn’t assess the impact of various “outside the market” measures being put in place to shore up supply reliability ahead of this summer, including: – The full capacity from the Jamestown (Neoen / Tesla) battery being built in South Australia – The SA government leasing 276 MW of diesel-fuelled generation – AEMO’s Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT) program and joint Demand Side Response (DSR) project with ARENA together seeking up to 1,000 MW of additional capacity or its equivalent These measures would all be expected to significantly reduce USE and the likelihood of load shedding this summer. While the current ESOO does not quantify how much impact these measures might have, AEMO’s June 2017 Energy Supply Outlook (ESO) did assess the effect of similar measures on USE levels for the next two summers: In the June ESO, the base USE levels for SA and Victoria (dark orange bars) were estimated at similar levels to the just-released ESOO, but the impact of the SA battery and temporary generators was to substantially reduce the USE level in SA, with a minor effect in Victoria (light blue bars). It would be reasonable to expect that the RERT / DSR initiatives (not modelled in either the June ESO or this week’s ESOO) to have a substantial effect on USE levels and likelihood of load shedding this summer, given the amount of capacity being targeted, around 1,000 MW. In conclusion, I think the best way to interpret USE measures and AEMO’s results overall is not to take them as definitive statements of how likely or how extensive any load shedding might be in coming summers – there are too many uncertainties still not captured in AEMO’s approach for that – but as relative risk indicators of supply-demand tightness in the power system. Without the measures being taken by governments and AEMO to address these risks , AEMO’s results for this summer would indicate some justified anxiety . As we get closer to summer we’ll have a clearer view of progress on these measures (and whether anything else has changed), and a better sense of the real likelihood of any repeat of last summer’s load shedding.

    "date": "07-09-2017 01:17:00 PM",
    "content": "In conjunction with my initial analysis of AEMO’s Electricity Statement of Opportunities 2017 report today , I have prepared this brief explanation of the meaning of “USE”. What is “USE”? AEMO’s assessment of NEM reliability is bound by the National Electricity Rules to quantify something called “Expected Unserved Energy”. This typically gets abbreviated as USE which strictly means just “Unserved Energy”, but the “Expected” qualifier is normally read in, and is very important . Unserved energy means the amount of end-customer demand (measured in megawatt hours) that cannot be supplied within a NEM region due to a deficiency of generation or interconnector capacity. In other words forced load shedding . 1) For examples we only have to look back to last summer when AEMO initiated load shedding in Adelaide for about an hour on Feb 8 , and in NSW on Feb 10 when a potline at the Tomago smelter was shed for just over an hour. Both of these actions were taken to maintain overall supply-demand balance and system security. 2) In the NEM reliability context, localised blackouts which occur due to failures of distribution or local transmission equipment do not count towards “unserved energy” . The “Expected” qualifier on USE can be confusing because here it means statistical expectation – an average across a range of future scenarios, weighted for probability – not what AEMO thinks will definitely, or is even most likely to happen. For an analogy, the statistically expected outcome of betting $100 on red at the roulette table is a return of just under $100 – but the returns from an actual bet will be either zero (occurring just over half the time) or $200 (just under half the time). So when AEMO assesses Expected Unserved Energy for a future period to be, say, 700 MWh, this really means that in some scenarios – hopefully most – they project no load shedding, but in others, a significantly larger amount than 700 MWh would be shed . Just to make the measure even more opaque, the NEM Rules target and most of AEMO’s data express USE as a percentage of annual regional consumption. So if that 700 MWh of USE were being projected for Victoria, which has an annual energy usage of around 45,000,000 MWh, it would be expressed as USE of 0.0016% – which sounds tiny, but if you were one of the customers making up 350 MW of load being shed for two hours, might not seem quite so small. The Reliability Standard and Measuring USE The NEM Reliability Standard requires that projected USE should not exceed 0.002% in any region. That’s easy to say and very difficult to assess. Load shedding becomes necessary when there is not enough supply to meet demand, evaluated down at half hourly granularity. Both demand and supply are highly variable with time of day, season, weather, generation outages, and numerous other factors. As implied above, measuring “Expected” unserved energy requires evaluating a wide range of forward supply-demand cases involving different levels and combinations of these variables for each NEM region. There’s documentation on AEMO’s website about how this is done using detailed power system models, but the key variables that affect results are the amount of generation and interconnector capacity available (determined by how much is built and available in each region, but also subject to unexpected breakdowns / outages), the maximum level of demand projected, and now with significant amounts of renewable generation in the system, levels of wind and sunshine and how these align with demand. To keep all the modelling manageable, AEMO run projections of demand calibrated to just two different maximum demand levels in each region, denoted as 50% POE and 10% POE. These refer to maximum demand levels forecast to be reached one year in two, and one year in ten respectively. Obviously the 10% POE value is higher – often substantially, reflecting the wide variation in maximum summer temperatures that is possible in south eastern Australia. Given these two demand benchmarks other uncertain factors like weather / wind / sunshine patterns and possible generator outages are statistically combined using historical patterns or failure rates to build up well over a hundred distinct supply-demand simulations for any given region and year and assessing which of these might lead to load shedding, and how much. The results from these individual simulations are then statistically combined back into a single weighted average (ie Expected) Unserved Energy value for each NEM region – the USE measure.

    "title": "It’s very misleading to claim “Since the introduction of the National Electricity Market in 1996 the wholesale price of energy has risen dramatically”",
    "date": "04-09-2017 12:50:00 PM",
    "content": "For various reasons (concern about climate change, increased consumer awareness, technology change in energy, rise of social media, and the rise of energy policy as a political football, etc…) we’ve witnessed a huge increase in commentary about energy (and energy data) that is coming from all sorts of different corners of the sector. Ourselves, we have also added to this with the commentary we’ve been posting on WattClarity since 2008, or even before. It’s probably fair to say that none of the commentary can be 100% correct about everything it covers. Of course we’re amongst those who make errors (I do hope we have been reducing the errors we make, over time, and dealing with them when we do). However reading today Saturday’s piece in the SMH by Allen Hicks of the ETU was one of the more concerning pieces I have read in recent times , especially given its publication in a broadly read media outlet like the SMH. I would have thought there would have been some basic fact checking before publication – particularly the following (very erroneous) claim: “Since the introduction of the National Electricity Market in 1996 the wholesale price of energy has risen dramatically.” (according to Allan Hicks at the ETU) Now, leaving aside the fact that the NEM started in 1998 and not 1996 (though there were precursors to the NEM running just in Victoria from 1994, and NSW and QLD after that), this claim seems to somehow link the increase in the wholesale price of energy with the creation of the NEM. I’m calling bullshit on that claim (apologies for the colourful language). Using our NEM-Review software, I’ve generated the following trend of monthly time-weighted average prices over the entire history of the NEM: For those who need some assistance, I have added two lines on the chart: 1) The first line (which runs for 16 years since the start of the NEM) is flat. Most monthly averages over that entire range were around $30/MWh (which, as an aside, might be long-run marginal cost only for a heavily depreciated legacy asset). (a) There are the two big deviations highlighted for the carbon tax period, and the prior NEM-wide drought. (b) There are also obviously regional deviations due to local supply/demand conditions, and so on. (c) To be explicit, this flat line shows that wholesale prices did not even keep pace with inflation . 2) Then, we see the rapid escalation of prices from about the start of 2015 which clearly have nothing to do with the start of the NEM . Let me be clear – prices have risen significantly in the past couple years – there is a train wreck in process , and it is really hurting energy users (particularly large ones), and it is happening for more than one reason (with each of these Villains contributing ). However to try to conflate “prices have risen dramatically” with a belief that this happened because of “the introduction of the National Electricity Market” at best reflects a very, very untrue alternate reality . I would have thought that the Electrical Trades Union would have had a better understanding of the history of our energy sector than that, and it does make me wonder why (it seems) they do not…",

    "date": "03-09-2017 02:20:00 PM",
    "content": "Worth a quick post today (Sunday), using ”Time Travel” mode in ez2view to wind the display back to yesterday evening at 17:10 NEM time (so 16:40 in South Australia) to flag how AEMO responded to a “Severe Weather Warning” alert issued by the Bureau of Meteorology. This (i.e. arguably greater responsiveness to weather warnings) is one change we’ve seen occurring more frequently following the South Australian blackout of 28th September 2016 – though, as noted here, it’s always a challenge to get the balance right . Here’s a first screenshot of what the market looked like at in this 17:10 dispatch interval on Saturday 2nd September 2017: For the benefit of our newer clients (and longer-term clients who want a refresher) I’ve included a couple of annotations above to help in reading the image, and we’ll have more detailed information in the online help site in the coming weeks… For the purpose of this article today, I’ve flagged the alert on the Market Notice in red , and indicated how we’d step into the specific widget to read more: In the second image I’ve highlighted in red the key piece of information – about the constraint set “I-VS_250” being invoked until further notice (which we might presume to be until the weather warning had eased). In the third snapshot, we step through to the Constraint Set details widget to look at the specifics of that particular constraint set: As shown in this 3rd image, this new constraint set contains only a single constraint equation, and this particular constraint equation was a long way from binding (at that point) because the surplus cheaper power in South Australia was leading to flows east on the interconnector, not west (with west being the direction of concern for AEMO). The flow has continued eastwards in the 18 hours since that time due to the windy conditions (to now, 14:10 on Sunday 3rd September) so we have not seen this constraint binding. Here’s a history of production by fuel type in South Australia over a similar period from NEM-watch : It shows aggregate wind output pretty constant at 1,200MW for the day (with the output being capped at that level by the “S_WIND_1200_AUTO” constraint , viewable in ez2view ), so reasonable to believe that output would be higher, without that constraint.",

    "title": "August Update: Regulatory Responses to Pricing Concern",
    "date": "28-08-2017 11:44:00 AM",
    "content": "Increased energy costs are well and truly back on the national agenda. Below, I briefly talk about the issue at hand, the political ramifications, and some of the regulatory options on the table. News today is that the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has called another meeting with the nation’s electricity industry chiefs. This latest meeting is said to be in response to a finding that more than one million households are paying more than they could be paying (presumably they are on standing offers). According to The Australian , ‘Mr Turnbull will require them [retailers] to outline how they will help more families get on to a better deal and what measures they have put in place to make it easier for customers to switch providers.’ With a less ambitious timeline, the ACCC is conducting a review of the industry and price increases. The ACCC review is examining the structure of the retail industry, the nature of competition, the representation of prices to consumers, and other factors influencing the price paid. The ACCC’s final report is due by 30 June 2018. It is clear that we are going to see a lot happen between now and 30 June 2018. Energy prices back on the agenda Concern about energy pricing follows a reasonably predictable pattern each year. Energy pricing increases often occur during mid-winter. For the month prior and four months following, media scrutiny increases, ombudsman complaints roll in, followed by political and regulatory action. Price increases do nothing to increase the popularity of energy retailers and most people equate price increases with price gouging. There is plenty of conjecture about how much profit retailers make. A retail bill is made up of a number of components with retail profit being one, but by no means the most significant component. Regardless, the customer facing businesses in this supply chain are retailers, and consequently, they are facing the greatest scrutiny. Generally, it is a difficult time for energy retailers (not that they will get any sympathy) with a focus on energy pricing, ever increasing competition, new energy sellers, and regulatory and political angst. What can be done The Prime Minister is reported to be calling for “… immediate action to reduce energy prices. It is not good enough that some customers cannot afford to turn their heating on in winter and their air-conditioning on in summer.” There are a range of regulatory options on the table, and they can be categorised into one of the following: a) More regulation, or re-regulation The ‘promise’ of deregulation and other measures taken to increase competition was that consumers would have more choice and would enjoy cheaper electricity. Despite these measures, we still see the dominance of the large three retailers and price increases. Figure used in the ACCC inquiry into retail electricity supply and pricing, Issues Paper 31 May 2017 Re-regulation is an obvious, although very unlikely regulatory response. Essential Services Commission chairman Ron Ben David has noted that re-regulation of pricing is an option but one that should only be considered if other regulatory responses fail: “I call re-regulation the ‘nuclear option’ because once you regulate a market, you remove the incentive for the service providers to be innovative. “I think we should try and maintain that incentive for as long as possible but if in the end we can’t make it work in the interests of consumers then we have to look at the options, and that would be re-regulation.” As expected, the industry is concerned about this possibility. The Australian Energy Council’s Chief executive Matthew Warren is reported in The Australian as responding: “We’ve seen re-regulation in the UK makes conditions worse for consumers because it kills competition, it flattens prices, and everyone gets the same cookie cutter outcome…” b) Trying to prompt consumers to switch In his previous meeting with retailers, the Prime Minister noted: “ We need a better deal. We know that, for example, the gap between the best and worst offers that a household can have can range from $900 to $1,500 a year depending on the household. And even within a particular company, with an individual company of yours, the gap can be between the best and the standard offer up to $400 a year .” An energy retailer cannot switch a customer from one market contract to another without explicit informed consent. Fines of up to $100,000 apply for each contravention, and there are a number of examples of retailers receiving significant fines where they have failed to obtain explicit informed consent. Various measures have been put in place to encourage consumers to find and take the best deal available. The include standardisation of offer information (in the form of Energy Price Factsheets), government comparator websites (such as energymadeeasy.gov.au ), and limitations on when a retailer can charge an early termination fee. Despite these measures, we continue to see consumers who either don’t realise that they could be saving money or who are not incentivised enough to pick up the phone and take up a better offer. In the 9 August 2017 ‘deal’ (resulting from the first meeting with the Prime Minister), retailers (only those at the meeting?) agreed to tell customers “in plain English” that their discount period is ending and that they will move onto the standard rate. Under the ‘deal’ consumer will be told how much extra this will cost every bill and will be informed of alternative offers. This is another measure aimed at encouraging consumers to switch but will it be effective? The pressure energy prices are placing on households and businesses is real, only time will tell if an appropriate and measured regulatory response can be found.

    "title": "Cloud patterns on Friday 19th May 2017 – leading to a day of low Solar PV output, NEM-wide",
    "date": "25-08-2017 11:34:00 AM",
    "content": "This post follow’s Paul’s post from Wednesday 23rd August, summarising the power system challenges brought by intermittent solar PV . I sent Paul a brief follow-up reply, and he suggested we add it as a post on WattClarity. I’ll briefly delve into the low solar output event across the NEM on Friday 19th May 2017, which seemed somewhat eclipse-like, as Paul points out in his post. Paul’s initial thought of “potential data error” (regarding the AEMO data included in the NEM-Review plots) triggered me to take a quick look, too. For background, I’m a Co-Founder in a solar forecasting service Solcast along with Dr Nick Engerer, who authored a post on WattClarity earlier this year . I’m also a former Meteorologist. Nick and I started Solcast to assist with the integration of increasing solar PV into power grids , in association with a research project at the ANU led by Nick. Solcast operates a global solar PV modelling and forecasting system. In areas with satellite coverage (like Australia), the system updates its forecasts every 10 or 15 minutes on an approximately 1-2km grid, using a range of empirical and dynamical techniques. When combined with metadata of individual installed PV systems, regulatory data on installations, and a few other elements, the system produces estimated actuals and forecasts of individual and aggregate PV output. One such aggregate that we track is the NEM-wide PV power output , the same aggregation unit used by Paul in his post. For the 19th May, Solcast’s actuals data showed a similar NEM-wide total daily production, just over 5,000MWh . QLD never gets above 300MW, and NSW barely passes 200MW. We sometimes see daytime dips to these levels for a few hours, however it’s very rare to see QLD and NSW as low as this for an entire day. For SA and VIC, days like this are more common, but as Paul has pointed out, it’s the NEM-wide spread that’s most notable here. We were interested enough to pull out some data for that day – here’s a plot of cloud opacity (optical thickness) at midday AEST on 19th May, derived from the satellite imagery plus a handful of other information sources, including PV data. The cloud situation was very similar all day. This kind of comma-shaped band of cloud is relatively common over eastern Australia, when you have moisture from the Coral Sea area feeding into a trough with a low-pressure system near SA or VIC. In this particular case of 19th May, the band of cloud happens to cover most of the populated areas of the NEM, and the cloud is very thick over a large area. Being a widespread and slow-moving cloud feature, it shows up as a significant outlier in Paul’s daily aggregate graph, since it lasted most or all of the day over most of the NEM’s installed rooftop PV. We also took a quick look at our PV forecasts for 19th May, to check our model was capturing the situation. Here’s a summary plot, showing our NEM-wide actuals and forecasts (day-ahead, plus a few of our 10-minute-updated short-range forecasts as issued on the day). To give a sense for the scale of the event, also plotted are our NEM-wide actuals for 15th May, a relatively cloud-free day during the week prior. The forecasts captured the event well, which is unsurprising given the cloud event was large and slow-moving. During the morning of the 19th, our forecast updates started similarly to the prior day-ahead view, then gradually and slightly downgraded, very closely matching the actuals by late morning. This forecast ‘hit’ is just the kind of ego-boost we need, as our algorithm development focuses on some much trickier cloud situations like afternoon convection and tropical cyclones. For those interested in the meteorology of this event, here is the BoM’s surface analysis chart from 10am AEST on 19th May – two hours prior to the cloud image shown above. The surface chart shows a weak trough of low pressure extending from a weak low-pressure system off the SA coast. At first glance this system is unremarkable, however it’s the remnants of a deeper low-pressure system that formed ahead of a pool of cold air in the upper atmosphere off the southwest WA coast almost a week earlier. The cold pool and low-pressure system pair had separated from the general Southern Ocean westerly flow, and hence were tracking very slowly (taking four days to get from Perth to Adelaide, for example). This slow movement allowed the system to gradually draw in large amounts of moisture from north of Australia, leading to the thick and widespread cloud that we saw over eastern coastal Australia on the 19th.

    "title": "A solar eclipse is just one type of a larger class of challenge with solar PV",
    "date": "23-08-2017 04:18:00 PM",
    "content": "With the North American solar eclipse of 21st August 2017 setting some packets of social media alight (and even rating mentions in the Fin Review (and this one copied over from Reuters ), along with the Australian (but not much about power!) , RenewEconomy and the Conversation ) it triggered some thoughts I’ve tried to post below. I also particularly noticed the tweet above, which quoted this article in the Financial Times and looked particularly at the Californian grid, despite * the fact that the eclipse was more severe in other parts of North America. * I presume (some of our more knowledgeable readers might like to confirm) that the focus on California might have been because of a combination of a number of factors including: Factor #1 = easier availability of data (though we note we have sourced better data for other parts of North America ); Factor #2 = higher penetration of PV (which the article from the Conversation, also linked above , seems to support – noting that “last year 10% of the state’s electricity came from PV”, from which I infer the author meaning annual energy, implying peak supply much higher than 10% ); and Factor #3 = higher level of interest (given size of demand, the sustainability policies in place, and general focus on innovation); Factor #4 = possibly a likelihood of clearer skies across California might have been a factor (thanks, Shane, for suggesting that one). Thinking through this today (and following coincidental conversations with a client or two) it seems to me that there are a number of challenges at work, here: Challenge #1) Intermittency delivers challenges over several timeframes Australia has not been subject to a similar eclipse, yet – though there is certainly awareness of that there’s a challenge coming down the line for us on 22nd July 2028. (a) That’s 11 years away, however, so plenty of time to plan for it (and, of course, to read about it afterwards on WattClarity – though there might be a different author writing by then…) (b) As I noted to some clients I was speaking with about this today, if all the engineers in the Californian electricity supply industry (or Australia as well) can’t keep the lights on for a one-off event known years in advance, then that would be a massive indictment. Hence it’s not really a surprise that everything went well in California this week (or in Germany a year or so ago). The event does flag a number of things that are much more challenging, however: 1a) Ramp rates, on a minute-by-minute timescale Giles’ article on RenewEconomy does flag that the real challenge of this week’s Eclipse in California was that it would massively increase the ramp-rate requirement of the back-up generators called on to meet the “net demand” requirement as the solar faded quickly, and then back off again as the system ramped up – noting: “California was preparing for ramp rates of twice the normal experience, from its average 29MW a minute to double that and a peak of 98MW a minute. In the future, when California reaches its 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030, and its 100 per cent target by 2050, those ramp rates will be even more impressive. Storage, demand management, smart controls, and back-up will play a critical role.” With respect to ramp rates, my sense is that it’s not so much a technical challenge as one involving economics, market structure and regulation – how to ensure that we have fast response capacity incentivised to enter the market at least cost . 1b) Scheduling and operations, on a day-to-day basis It did not take long this morning to see that the NEM has already experienced a number of significant drops in aggregate small-scale solar PV , right across the NEM. With current levels of PV installation (only about 4,000MW from memory) these are of marginal significance currently – but the significance will ramp quickly as the roll-out of PV continues into the future (with installation of commercial PV apparently in a sweet spot at present). Using NEM-Review v6 , for instance, I’ve quickly generated this trend of aggregate daily output of the AEMO’s estimates for small-scale PV on a region basis (in this case aggregated up to NEM-wide). As noted on the image, we see a staggering 60% drop in aggregate output NEM-wide from 18th May to 19th May 2017 (that’s off an already low base the day before). Being a data junkie, my first thought in reading something like this is always “potential data error?”, hence I delved deeper into the half-hour data for May, and separated out each of the regions to produce the following chart, again with NEM-Review v6 : As can be seen, the estimated output for both QLD and NSW (the biggest regions, in terms of contributions) had been declining progressively from Tuesday through to Friday 19th May. Victoria and South Australia seem to have a different pattern. Whilst the output is not seen to drop for Tasmania on Friday (it increases on Friday, and then reduces very low on Saturday) it’s off a very low base. Given population of Tasmania, and latitude, I suspect that Tasmania is unlikely to account for much in terms of percentage share of solar PV (no offence intended to our Tasmanian friends). 1c) Planning and development, on a longer-term basis Over a longer time-frame, there are other challenges – related to planning for, and development of (including ensuring correct economic signals for) the right type of capacity to help keep the lights on when the sun’s not shining so brightly. Chunking the above data in NEM-Review v6 up to months, and throwing on data for our entire fleet of large-scale PV as a useful comparison (on the right axis, 10 times smaller currently) provides a useful illustration of the seasonality: As can be seen, winter solar harvest is only half as effective as summer harvest (perhaps less, keeping in mind installations increased from January to June 2017). Challenge #2) Prediction, or anticipation, is a factor It’s not like the North American eclipse of 21st August was not expected. As noted above, we should be expecting smooth sailing from our market/network operators in cases like these. It’s the unpredictable events that we should be more wary of , and devoting more attention to (though perhaps not as snazzy a photo opportunity) – like where the wind went during May-June 2017 , and the remarkable (but hitherto not remarked on?) drop in output through to Friday 19th May 2017! That’s why I am particularly interested to watch innovations such as what AEMO is doing with ASEFS and AWEFS, and what other providers (like SolCast , and others we’ve heard about) are developing – they will be a major part of meeting the challenges ahead. Challenge #3) Access to real data is a significant challenge In Giles’ article on RenewEconomy he notes that the majority of PV installed in California is large-scale solar, with the inference being that these systems provide much better real-time data – which would certainly have helped the California ISO in its role of “keeping the lights on”. Given the 10x difference here between small and large (currently, though plenty of projects being added to our Generator Catalog as they pop up!) in the NEM, this would be a much harder job for the AEMO, all else being equal. I’ve already posted about “the Opacity of rooftop PV” , as one aspect of a broader challenge with Distributed Energy Resources (and have noted elsewhere how we’re working to assist in the challenging space of data about distributed battery storage systems). PS – oh, I forgot to mention that (as we are, at home, the very grateful recipient of a long-dated and hyper-generous 44c FIT for our 5kW system at home + being a data junkie and working in the space) I am a keen watcher of my own output. (a) To date I’ve been using PVOutput for the purpose, but have found the data a bit flaky (a growing number of gaps, which have been explained to me as changes to HTTP protocols); (b) Hence have recently signed up to a better offering from Solar Analytics , using the WattWatchers gadget – however been having some teething problems with that. Update from Tue 7th November On Tuesday 7th November I have posted some initial musings about my own rooftop solar learning exercise . Another example of the challenges of getting data about distributed resources. Will hope to update you with more details later, when the teething problems are all sorted… Apologies, that’s all the thoughts I‘ve had time to post today – check back on WattClarity later for other articles…",

    "title": "Energy Users as the “victim” in the train wreck that’s unfolding before our eyes",
    "date": "18-08-2017 12:33:00 PM",
    "content": "As the CEC’s Clean Energy Summit on Wednesday 19th July, I provided this forecast (of sorts) for Australia’s National Electricity Market – talking about the train wreck that’s unfolding before all of our eyes . In my next-day brief article, I undertook to post progressively more of this presentation with some added detail I’d not had time to talk through in the brief presentation. In the four weeks since that time, we’ve been heavily committed to directly assisting clients (both pre-existing, and new ones emerging from the woodwork) through our growing suite of software offerings. Hence no time to post more, at this point. Last week we were in Adelaide for a few days, including starting some new clients with our software and delivering day-long training session on some detailed nuances of how the NEM operates (in conjunction with one of the external consultants we collaborate with for these types of things). 1) Energy users as “Victims” Whilst we were in Adelaide, I could not help but notice (given the keen media interest) that a number of CEOs of (the larger) Electricity Retail companies were called to Canberra for our PM’s own version of a “shirt-fronting” on how electricity consumers are being screwed with ultimatums given about vaguely-worded drastic actions that the Federal Government might take if a plan for improvement was not forthcoming (and quick). I believe these same CEOs are back in Canberra today for Act 2 , so we’ll see what eventuates out of this… My forecast at the Conference took the form of a 4-character pantomime , and I invested some time to talk through each of the 4 characters – to examine how they had come to claim these roles (in my view). I used this image of the “hapless victim” being tied up on the tracks, with the coal-belching steam train relentlessly approaching. This image does seem to resonate with much of the commentary in the mainstream media, and in social media. Certainly there has been plenty of press coverage of electricity prices and their effect on energy users. We’re partly the reason that this has occurred, with the review of Q2 2017 that I posted on 6th July being picked up by a number of different media networks . My article concerned wholesale prices only (and particularly “physical” prices). Since that time there has seemed to be an increase in the volume of coverage of the massive increase in cost of electricity paid by energy users (of which wholesale is only one component). 2) More focus is on residential – but is a bigger looming crisis with cost of energy for business? In what I have seen in the traditional news media, and on social media, the majority of coverage does seem to be focusing on costs of electricity to residential energy users. This is understandable, given that residential energy users are a better direct correlation with the voting population – and we all know that the number one thing that scares any politician is an angry voter. 2a) Costs for residential users have been increasing … and it’s not like residential customers don’t have a reason to be concerned. Two pieces of analytical work that sum up these concerns are: (a) The “MarkIntell Major Retailer Residential Electricity Price Series” ; and (b) The St Vincent de Paul series of reports , powered by the Alviss Consulting data sets. It’s my understanding that both sets of analysis are based on the same underlying data – being retailer’s published residential retail offers (though with different methodologies for collection). The MarkIntell series is included here, for your ease of reference: With the one above, it’s a pity that the data series does not project back further in the past (as that would have delivered a fuller picture of how cost of energy has increased over the longer term). The chart in the Vinnies report (published earlier) below provides that longer-term picture (one that’s primarily about cost increases over the 7 years shown): It was the MarkIntell update following rate changes for the June->July 2017 transition that led to mainstream media reports of Australian residential energy users paying the “highest electricity price in the world” (including this article in the AFR on 4th August ). However it is worth remembering Keith Orchison’s note of caution published the next day about such inadvertent hyperbole . Here’s the chart from the AER’s “State of the Energy Market 2017” report , as a comparison to the “highest electricity price in the world” comparison: No matter that what we’re paying in Australia may not be exactly “highest in the world” – the fact that they are high, and increasing, is a very valid cause for concern. 2b) … but my concern is greater for business use of electricity I am also concerned, however, that a disproportionately low share of the conversation/focus seems to be directed towards the effect these high prices is having on all businesses , and in particular the comparatively large share of energy-intensive energy users Australia has accumulated over past decades. I posted at the end of June about one South Australian energy user had entered liquidation – at the loss of about 30 jobs, I believe. This energy user had been a very new client of ours, so their name popped out of the liquidation notice when I’d read it (unfortunately what we could do to help was “too little, too late”) – but there are a number of other notices we have seen. There have been a smattering of articles (like Chris Stott’s article in the AFR on 15th August that cautions share investors that energy prices are going to make a significant dent in the bottom line of many companies , which was followed by Michael Bleby’s article on 17th August quoting Stockland in warning electricity prices will flow through to business results ) For a start, it has seemed to me another example of low energy literacy, more broadly, is skewing the focus of discussions around this broad energy transition . Over the past decade and more, too many changes have been marketed in terms of how this-or-that “will only add $X (or Y%) to the average annual residential retail bill”. Yes, residential energy use (and the cost of it) is important – however across the NEM it’s business use of electricity that dwarfs residential use by volume – as noted today in this linked article that I have posted separately, as I have a hunch I’ll need to be referring to it repeatedly in the coming weeks and months. It’s businesses that provide us our jobs (and salaries), and our dividends from investments. It’s the major energy users that are facing systemic crisis in an environment of escalating cost pressures (in an environment where many seem oblivious to this – and some would even seem supportive of the idea that they shut up and leave, given the mistaken belief that the primary KPI should be “% of supply from [INSERT.HOBBY.HORSE.HERE]”). Unfortunately, it’s been harder for the market to evolve similar price/cost comparison services such as the two highlighted above for retail electricity prices/costs. There are a number of reasons for this, with three big ones being: 1) The non-standard nature of business electricity consumption (there is no such thing as a “typical” business user – whereas one might grit teeth and believe that a “typical” residential user still exists); 2) Cost offered for business users varies depending on duration of retail contract; and 3) Offers made to business users are One that I am aware about is Energy Action’s Price Index (EAPI) for business – which has seen a marked upward trend in all four mainland regions in the past year or two – most markedly in South Australia. Here’s the trend that I see today: If any of our readers know of other (business-focused) price indexes, we’re very keen to hear about them (given that we’re a company full of “data junkies”). Please let us know through comments below, or offline directly (tel +61 7 3368 4064). 3) Energy users are not, so much, “hapless victims”? With respect to both residential and business users, I did make the comment several weeks ago that the image (above) of the “damsel in distress” might be taken to imply too much helplessness on the part of the energy user. Certainly there are a number of factors outside of the energy user’s control that have contributed to driving energy costs higher. However there have also been some actions (not taken) within energy user’s control that have added to the inflation of electricity prices. We’ve seen other mainstream media articles point out the “laziness tax” of not shopping around for a better deal that’s affected residential energy users. At the business end, most have been forced to shop around, though the level of sophistication taken in the approach adopted (either by the energy user themselves, or on their behalf by the diverse bunch of retail energy brokers that service them) has shown a wide diversity, from what I have seen. Other approaches that might offer some benefit (such as spot-exposure and demand response ) have been genuinely assessed as options by a growing number of energy users over the past decade, though off a very low base. More recently, self-supplies through embedded generation (primarily PV) has increased in popularity. Perhaps (with time permitting) we’d be able to showcase some options for business energy users here on WattClarity, with the assistance of the consultants and service providers who supply these services?",

    "title": "[In the NEM, at least] Business consumption of electricity dwarfs residential consumption of electricity",
    "date": "18-08-2017 11:16:00 AM",
    "content": "In my presentation at the CEC’s Clean Energy Summit back on 19th July 2017, I spoke about some aspects of how I see we’ve been doing a pretty poor job of managing this broad energy transition to maximise the upsides, and minimise the downsides. In separate posts (which I’ll try to collect here under this “Energy Transition” category on WattClarity ) I’ll be discussing various points in more detail. In this post, I wanted to copy in the following chart from AEMO’s “2017 Electricity Forecasting Insights” report that I used on the day to illustrate how business use of electricity dwarfs residential use : Yet this is not what an unknowledgeable outsider would assume, if they were to gauge by percentage of coverage in the mainstream media (and even on social media). Over the past decade I have come to the view that this aspect of poor energy literacy has led to unenvisaged consequences as we walk down the path of this energy transition. In the chart AEMO provides on this page , we see that business sector annual consumption in the NEM was a little lower than 130,000GWh in 2016 (note that I don’t believe this covers the volume of consumption represented by new upstream compression of gas for export via LNG – this would be roughly 7,000GWh). In the same way, AEMO provides a chart on this page for residential electricity consumption shows it to be a little under 60,000GWh in 2017. The main take-away, here, is that Business Sector annual electricity consumption is more than twice that of Residential Sector electricity consumption . It is my belief that the current high share of electricity consumption across various sectors has arisen in the NEM (and similarly in the WEM, as well) for a variety of reasons – including: 1) the natural resources our country is blessed with especially in proportion to the small scale of our population , 2) historically positive government policies aimed at helping the country benefit from this resource base, and 3) our historically low cost of energy on the back of large volumes of coal-fired generation. This starting position is meaning unique challenges for us in this energy transition. I believe that this ratio is not as skewed in a number of other locations around the world . Some of our informed readers might like to provide some comparisons in comments below?",

    "title": "ACCC chief, Rod Sims, includes 6 factors driving retail electricity prices higher",
    "date": "28-07-2017 11:56:00 AM",
    "content": "The ACCC has recently opened an investigation into why electricity prices have climbed considerably in the past few years. It’s an outcome that has been one factor promoting the electricity sector to a front page news story – including prior reference to my review of Q2 prices on WattClarity , and is a significant reason why it’s clear to me we’re in the midst of an evolving train wreck . It was with interest, then, that I read in the Courier Mail (on Wednesday 26th July?) an article contributed by Rod Sims at the ACCC highlighting 6 big factors that had all combined to contribute to the higher energy prices. This (I believe) was timed to coincide with both: Public forum in Brisbane on Tuesday 25th July into electricity supply and prices – with forums in other locations still to be held the ACCC/AER Regulatory Conference in Brisbane the next two days – Thu 27th July and Fri 28th July (today). My sense is that there are more than 6 – but the most important point (in my view) is that there are a number of factors, some inter-related – and yet this seems to be often (overly) simplified in the general desire we all have for a simple view of a “smoking gun” . Here’s an example from today in a tweet that involves at least 3 different actors ( Stefan , RenewEconomy and TAI ( release today but with link to full report from June )) where the message has been over-simplified to be written as “gold-plating behind sky high prices”. Unfortunately, reality is often more complex than 140 characters will allow for – and doubly-unfortunately, it seems we are collectively grasping for answers that fit into pithy sound-bites. 1) My recollection of Rod Sims’ 6 factors contributing to higher electricity prices For the benefit of those who could not read Rod Sims’ words on Wednesday, here’s my recollection of the 6 factors listed as contributing to high prices : 1a) Reduced competition My recollection is that Rod Sims wrote about this from the perspective of both the wholesale market (for instance, in terms of the 3-into-2 merger of QLD Government-owned Generators that’s the first of three factors I mentioned here with respect to high wholesale electricity prices in Queensland ). The Courier Mail quotes Rod Sims urging the break-up of the two large QLD generators. Rod also wrote about consolidation in the retail sector, with respect to a high percentage (I think something like 80% of customers – not sure if by load or customer volume) still with the “big three” of AGL, Origin and EnergyAustralia. 1b) Returns on assets at network business has increased Rod Sims also wrote about high returns on assets at network businesses – stemming from a number of factors (ownership, form of regulation, Merits Review process, etc). This is the “gold plating” argument advanced above. 1c) Over-reaction to outages, leading to excessive reliability standards Rod Sims also wrote about the reaction of prior state governments in establishing (what are now seen as) excessive reliability standards leading out of the experience of public backlash to distribution network outages during summer storms (e.g. the “Somerville Enquiry” commissioned by the Beattie Labour Government in Queensland after blackouts of summer 2003-04 ) . 1d) High gas prices Rod Sims also wrote about the contribution of high gas prices. 1e) Overly generous green schemes Rod Sims also wrote about overly generous green schemes – particularly focusing on excessive Feed-in-Tariff regimes implemented by previous Governments which paid recipients too much in some states (see previous note about how I’m personally a beneficiary of this – but understand that others are going to be paying (for at least another decade) for this benefit to us at home ). 1f) What was the 6th factor noted?? Apologies – have drawn a mental blank on the 6th one. My sense is that there are more than 6 factors at work, but that Rod only highlighted 6 for whatever reason. However at present I can’t remember which factor Rod Sims picked for the 6th one (or did he separate out the market consolidation in 1a above?) Apology on this record Unfortunately I did not save a copy of the article at the time – and have not (in a quick scan) been able to find a link to it (either on the CM site, or the ACCC site, or elsewhere). In the absence of such a record elsewhere, I’ve noted my recollection of Rod Sims’ comments. I think the 5 factors I’ve listed were 5 of the 6 that Rod noted, but the order is probably different than as Rod had written. If someone can point me at a URL link to the actual comments, I’ll link them in here for completeness? Here’s a link to the 6 Factors With thanks the ACCC, they’ve come through with this link on the Courier Mail site to the 6 factors (unfortunately behind a paywall restricting access). Rod noted the 6 factors in his conference address Helpfully, Rod has noted that he walked through his 6 factors in his conference address this week (I was correct in suspecting I’d combined two-into-one in my point (1a) above). 2) ACCC enquiries into energy prices It’s not 100% clear to me, but it seems that the ACCC has a number of related inquiries and investigations currently underway, including the following: 2a) NEM-wide focus, on retail prices According to the ACCC website here , the Treasurer has asked that the ACCC conduct an inquiry into retail electricity prices. There’s this initial information here on the ACCC site , and also this information about Public Forums currently being held (including the one in Brisbane on Tuesday this week). This document gives some key dates: Preliminary report to the Treasurer by 27th September 2017 Final report by 30th June 2018 This paper provides an overview of submissions made in response to the Issues Paper. 2b) Queensland focus, on wholesale generators It’s my understanding that the ACCC is starting to review into the market power of the Government-owned generators in Queensland, following a request from the Federal Minister Energy & Environment. However I can’t immediately find anything about this on the ACCC website. 2c) Gas market transparency For completeness, there is also an ongoing inquiry into Gas market transparency, with more details available here .",

    "title": "Forecast, of sorts, for the National Electricity Market – Train Wreck upon us?",
    "date": "20-07-2017 09:48:00 AM",
    "content": "This week (Tuesday 18th and Wednesday 19th July) I’ve been pleased to be able to attend the Clean Energy Council (CEC)’s Clean Energy Summit in Sydney. A well-attended forum by CEC Members and other interested industry stakeholders. In the lead-up to the Summit, I was asked to speak in a session focused on forecasting for the wholesale market, and for LGCs. As I explained to my audience, I was a little surprised to be asked to speak in a forecasting forum, given my my prior comments on why forecasting is a mug’s game . Given that we’re not a company that provides numerical forecasts, but that I have been puzzling through the wicked problem of resolving the Energy Trilemma that’s upon us, I shared some of my perspectives of the challenge that is upon us. I summed this up in the following 4-actor caricature: I don’t have enough time today to translate my presentation to a written post here on WattClarity (and it would be too long in any case), so will endeavour to progressively provide shorter snippets as sequential posts: 1) Crisis is upon us In July 2016 I posted about a remarkable pattern of prices seen through Q2 across all regions of the NEM . Earlier this month I updated this analysis for Q2 2017 and noted how the results had become even more extreme (which was then picked up elsewhere ). In my recent article, and at the conference, I suggested that this now appears to be a more systemic change in pricing patterns . As I noted at the conference, these patterns will pose significant challenges to (a) the “buy low, sell high” arbitrage approach that would power battery storage, and (b) the sheer number of hours involved (more than 50% of the half-hours above $100/MWh in TAS, VIC and SA through Q2 2017) making all methods of demand response more problematic. I’ve also noted how we’re seeing this already have a significant toll on the large industrial energy users we serve as a valued part of our client base. As noted to the audience, I’m more pessimistic than other speakers at the event had seemed to be that we’re close to a resolution. 2) Four types of actors in the drama Through my presentation, I then walked through some examples of how different people (and “things”) seem to have been auditioning for the four roles in the emerging crisis (the Victim, the Means of Destruction, the Villain and the Saviour). In upcoming posts, I’ll be endeavouring to translate these thoughts (more fully formed) into discrete articles on WattClarity . In an effort to forestall misdirected comments below, let me re-state my perspective that: (a) The energy transition is occurring for a number of different reasons. (b) it’s not the destination that has necessarily lead to the crisis upon us, it’s been the inadequate process we’ve all been following whilst striving to get there.",

    "title": "Cost Confusion",
    "date": "13-07-2017 12:54:00 PM",
    "content": "The cost of electricity has become daily news fodder and looks like it will be for some time to come. In this article I want to focus on the costs of generating electricity from different sources and try to unpick a few fallacies and misuses of measures commonly used to represent these costs. Supply = Demand The first thing to remember is that unlike many goods and most physical commodities, electrical energy is not produced in the form of “widgets” which can be separately produced, delivered, and used at different times and different rates. Essentially in any large electricity system all three actions – production, delivery, and usage – happen instantaneously and at the same rate (in aggregate). If they don’t – the lights go out. Even where a system has the capability to store energy in the form of pumped hydro or batteries, to pick a couple of topical technologies, electrical energy first gets converted to another form – gravitational potential by pumping water uphill, or chemical energy by recharging a battery – and then reconverted to electrical energy when it’s used. So as far as electricity itself is concerned, production delivery and usage still happen all at once. Because its production and usage are inextricably tied together, we can’t just make electricity in the most “cost-efficient” way at times that best suit production – whether that’s from “baseload” power stations running constantly 24/7 (which of course they don’t – there’s maintenance, and also “unplanned outages” – i.e. breakdowns), or from windfarms and solar panels as and when wind and sunshine allow – and then use what’s previously been made when we need to. The rate at which we make it must exactly match the rate at which we use it, second to second. And as everyone knows we don’t use electricity anything like uniformly: This has very important implications for working out the real costs of electricity production. LCOE and its Assumptions Unfortunately the most common metric used to compare costs of different forms of generation – and this applies in industry literature, not just the popular press – completely skips over this fundamental truth. This measure goes by various names but often it’s called the Long-run (or “Levellised”) Cost Of Electricity – “LCOE” . In principle, it’s a simple yardstick that attempts to combine the various types and levels of cost involved in generating power into a single dollar figure, and divide this figure by a quantity of electricity generated to produce a per-unit cost of electrical energy, usually expressed in units of dollars per megawatt hour ($/MWh). As the “Long-run” part of the name suggests, a feature of this metric is an attempt to attribute or spread the large up-front investment, or capital costs of power generation technologies to amounts of energy produced, across long plant lifetimes – decades in most cases. In doing this, as well as capturing the different types of cost involved, the calculations behind the measure rely on some critical assumptions about the rate of return on investment (or discount rate in financial engineering terms), and capacity utilization , i.e. energy production relative to maximum capacity, for different technologies. What LCOE measures usually do is express all costs of building owning and running a power station of a given megawatt capacity in dollars per year (using the rate of return to convert upfront capital costs to an annual equivalent), and divide this by output in megawatt hours per year – which comes from an assumption about capacity utilization. Because a large proportion of the total costs of building owning and operating any form of generation are fixed, the per-unit cost of production varies strongly and inversely with this assumed capacity utilization, as illustrated on the chart below: And this is the root of a key problem with LCOE in the way we often see it employed. Because electricity has to be made as it is used, we simply can’t assume some particular fixed capacity utilization factor for a specific technology or power station to get an output figure, divide that into costs for that same time period, and arrive at a number that can be blithely thrown about as a meaningful comparator between technologies, or that yields much insight into that technology’s impact on the overall cost of production in a real-world electricity system. System Realities The need to generate electricity only as it used, and the widely varying rate of that usage mean that regardless of technology, the capacity utilization of generators fluctuates enormously across the fleet at any one time (so at any point in time some are running at maximum capacity and others not at all), and utilization for any given generator also varies across time. Any real-world fleet will comprise some generators which usually run at high utilization and others which run at relatively low and quite variable utilization rates. The chart below shows the range of capacity utilization rates (monthly and annual) applying to the Queensland generation fleet in 2016. Simple cost of production measures like LCOE that ignore this reality by assuming a single fixed capacity utilization can therefore be highly misleading. A related problem with LCOE measures in application to real world systems is that if we add a new power station to an existing system, this will reduce the capacity factors of some or all of the other power stations in the fleet (because total production must still equal demand) and therefore increase their unit costs of production. So drawing conclusions about impacts on system average costs on the basis of LCOE measures is fraught. And impacts on market prices will be different again because market prices tend to reflect short run variable costs and overall supply demand balance rather than total costs. Dispatchability A third justified criticism of LCOE focuses on the issue of “dispatchability”. This criticism points out that because of the need to continuously balance supply and demand there is a difference in value to an electricity system of generation sources whose output can be called up and controlled (“dispatched”) anywhere between some minimum value (ideally zero) and maximum capacity, versus those whose output is largely determined by non-controllable factors like wind and sunshine. Simple LCOE measures totally ignore this complication. There are sometimes extensions or modifications of the LCOE concept proposed to factor in “firming costs” for non-dispatchable technologies. This might involve adding in costs for a storage capability attached to a non-dispatchable source, or extra costs for a certain “matched” quantity of dispatchable generating capacity to supplement variable output from the non-dispatchable source. Finkel had a go at this: But these approaches suffer from the same fundamental problem as LCOE – fixed and somewhat arbitrary assumptions (and more of them) about amounts of and utilization rates for the supplementing technologies, and for the overall utilization of the combination in a real-world system. These attempts may be directionally useful in at least highlighting that costs for dispatchable and non-dispatchable sources are not directly comparable, but they are necessarily imprecise (despite charts like the one above) and really do little to resolve which technology is “cheaper” – something LCOE is not much good for even when comparing one form of conventional dispatchable technology with another. Here it’s worth reiterating that assumptions that dispatchable “baseload” generation technology like coal or combined-cycle gas plant can simply run at a preferred high capacity factor at all times and never break down – implicit in LCOE measures and absence of any “firming costs” for these technologies – are also inappropriate. In an all-coal or all-gas or all-anything system, relatively few generators would be able to run this way. Why Bother with LCOE? So what is LCOE good for? Predominantly for assessing trends in generation costs for a given technology type over time – and only for comparison between technologies where their cost structures and technical characteristics happen to be very similar, meaning that they will play similar roles in a real world electricity system. So pointing out a falling trend over time in the LCOE of solar PV technologies is a very valid use of the measure. Comparing the LCOEs of (say) sub-critical and ultrasupercritical coal, or even the LCOEs of coal with and without carbon capture and storage, is also generally valid (although there are even traps in this once we explicitly factor in a price on carbon emissions). LCOE can also be a useful metric if you’re a project developer or asset owner fortunate enough to find a buyer for your power station’s output who’s willing to take on the risks of variable capacity utilization and market prices, and offer you a fixed price Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for a relatively predictable quantity of production. In this case comparing the price struck in the PPA with the LCOE of your power station is a valid indicator of profitability. But note that here it’s the buyer who takes on the risks that the value of that electricity to the system is markedly different from the PPA price or LCOE. Alternatives After all that bagging of that particular measure, what are the alternatives? This will have to wait for another article, but there certainly are better ways to evaluate the relative economic value of different generation technologies, as well as demand-side measures. And they all start with the recognition, unlike LCOE measures, that the costs of meeting electricity demand have to be evaluated on a system-wide basis, not by focussing simply on individual technologies or power stations.

    "title": "Here’s three big reasons why spot prices in Queensland are higher than they used to be",
    "date": "11-07-2017 03:23:00 PM",
    "content": "In my post last week , I noted that “our need to rapidly increase the capacity of our thinking, to deal with a greatly increased number of wildly changing variables, currently seems to have far outstripped our collective willingness, or ability, to do this (or, in most cases, even an awareness that this intelligence gap has opened)” . This followed from an earlier comment the week before , and that was also not the first time I’ve made that point on WattClarity … (A) Three examples come to mind this week… I’ll list the three (all somewhat related) but focus on addressing the first one directly in this post: (A1) Why are spot prices high in Queensland? This week there’s been another round of finger-pointing over high wholesale electricity prices in Queensland – dutifully covered in places like the Australian and the ABC . Sad to say that this kind of thing has become almost expected from people I’d hope would be our wiser leaders. I did a double-take, however, when I read this line in the report from the ABC: Tony Wood, energy program director at the Grattan Institute, said there was no clear explanation for why Queensland has seen high electricity prices in recent years. (my emphasis added) Part of the reason for my reaction, I think, is that I respect Tony and the work done by the Grattan Institute. It made me wonder how many others are still in the dark about the factors causing Queensland prices to be high. In the interests of clarity, let me post what I hope is a clear explanation below. Please feel free to weigh in with comments (online below, or direct with me) to let me know which quadrant you think my explanation falls into: (A2) If prices have risen significantly in QLD (where we don’t have wind) then wind can’t have contributed to price rises in SA, can it?! The South Australian government has been on the receiving end of a fair amount of criticism over the past 12 months, following from a number of events (including the blackout of 28th September , the load-shedding of 8th February and a near-miss of 3rd March that’s less talked about), with security of supply concerns layered on top of concerns about rising electricity costs. A number of critics have taken the over-simplistic view that the outcomes in South Australia have been wholly the result of the rise in market share of intermittent generation. More broadly, the renewables industry has felt the brunt of these criticisms, and has understandably responded. The following chart (from the CEC) is one that has been doing the rounds for a number of months: (a) Those towards the “rabid right” of the Emotion-o-meter should not read this inclusion as me stating that the CEC is totally wrong in drawing attention to the over-simplification that “renewables are to blame for everything”. (b) However those towards the “loopy left” of of that same Emotion-o-meter should also not read this chart as “proving” that the complex nuances of intermittency have had nothing to do with the growing challenges faced in South Australia – and which we will increasingly face more broadly NEM-wide. Again, my main point is that I am hopeful that all of us (including, but not just the CEC) can rapidly progress our up the learning curve such that we can more fully understand the increasingly complex electricity system, and clearly communicate some of these complexities to others. (A3) “The other guy” is always to blame for the bad stuff Back squarely in the political domain, there’s been far too many examples (and not just in energy policy) where “the other guy/gal” is always to blame for the bad news (e.g. high prices), whilst the current Government/Minister is always the person to take credit for the good news. Given the theme is Queensland in this post, I’ll pick on the QLD Energy Minister (though they all share similar traits – though perhaps some not as prolific on Twitter ): My point here not that what has been noted is completely wrong – though it would have been truer if Mark had also noted: (a) That there are lagging factors from yesterday contributing to what we see in retail prices today. Hence it’s a bit simplistic to just say increases in the other guy’s term were wholly there fault (and not contributed to them, to some degree, by decisions made in the Beattie/Bligh period); and (b) It would also have helped if Mark had clarified that percentage increases during his term are off the higher base achieved by the big percentage increases beforehand. etc… Again, my point is that I don’t believe I’m alone in wishing that our elected leaders would start to act more genuinely like the real (i.e. wise) leaders? Each of the above examples relate to high spot prices in the QLD region of the NEM in various ways. Each of these cases also provides what I see as a pretty stark illustration of why we need to (collectively) raise our level of thinking about the significant challenges that confront us in this multi-faceted energy transition . Within our own company, we are really striving to do this – which is why we have re-invested $millions over the years in continuing to make our software provide an increasingly better picture, for instance. (B) Three main reasons why spot prices in Queensland have risen There are more than three reasons, and I don’t have time to go into them all – but the following three are (in my view) the most significant. Frequent readers at WattClarity will remember that we’ve been posting analysis of high prices in Queensland – indeed, we even published quite a lengthy report going into some detail of why prices rose in summer 2012-13 (back at the time clients paid $5,000 for this report – but the passage of time has enabled us to drop the price to only $500 , despite the fact that some of the same factors are still relevant). (B1) Market Structure has consolidated Back when the NEM started, there were four (smaller) Government-Owned Generation Companies operating in Queensland – CS Energy, Enertrade, Tarong Energy and Stanwell Corporation. Since then, these four companies have been whittled down to only 2 – larger CS Energy and larger Stanwell Corporation. (a) Enertrade (an organisation set up to trade loss-making power purchase agreements entered into by the Government prior to the NEM), was wound up in 2007, and the PPAs reassigned to the three remaining GOCs. (b) On 1st July 2011 three became two , with the reallocation of the portfolio between just CS Energy and Stanwell Corporation The move to two GOCs was initiated because of what the Bligh Labor Government at the time saw was a poor financial return from the three generation companies that existed at the time. As shareholders, they sought to improve the returns on their investment in these assets, so the corporations could contribute more to the Queensland budget in net terms. There’s other reports about the money that Queensland Treasury had to chip in to keep some operational. Hence the response is an understandable action for a shareholder (whether Government or private) that owns multiple organisations competing in the same market. Unfortunately it has contributed, in no small way, to the higher prices we’ve been seeing for a number of years. A key point here, in the debate this week and in prior years, is that the core underlying reason is market structure (i.e. concentration) as distinct from market rules . It is important to understand that the GOCs have (as much as I have been able to see, being an outside observer) operated as they should in a competitive market – by striving to deliver the best returns for their shareholders. A reduced number of competitors (especially after 2011) allowed a much greater range of flexibility to make this happen. (B2) Queensland region demand has increased Coming on top of the greater market consolidation in Queensland, electricity demand in Queensland has increased in more recent times – which is an outcome different than the declining demand story seem more generally. This has been predominantly due to the upstream (electrified) compression of coal-seam gas being piped to Gladstone to export through three shiny new LNG export terminals. This can be seen in the following chart of monthly average (and peak) “Scheduled Demand” produced in NEM-Review v6 : For ease of reference, I have also marked where the 3-into-2 merger occurred – changes flowing from which were apparent in summer 2012-13 and have continued since. The growth in domestic demand over the past 18 months or so has been compounded by a flow-on effect of generation closures in the south ( dragging more production from Queensland south over the QNI interconnector). (B3) Gas for generation has greatly increased in price In the years leading up to the commissioning of the LNG trains, upstream coal seam gas wells were drilled and, because of their nature, could not be easily capped – hence the gas supplies were sold under low priced arrangements commonly called “take or pay”. As the LNG trains have been progressively commissioned, the pricing of gas for power generation has changed markedly – which has flowed through to bid prices for gas-fired plant in Queensland. Using ez2view and randomly sampling bids for a randomly selected gas power station (Braemar A power station – operated by a private sector player) in the following two images illustrates this point – see the much lower incidence of blue bids (i.e. bids below $0/MWh at the RRN) and much higher incidence of red bids (i.e. bids to run only when the price is above above $300/MWh): I hope that this post has done a bit to make these three key changes underlying the higher spot prices for QLD more clear?",

    "title": "The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) contributes to recent wind drought",
    "date": "07-07-2017 12:31:00 PM",
    "content": "Some background to this article On Friday 30th June 2017, Paul McArdle posed the question on WattClarity of “Where’s the wind gone? NEM-wide wind farm operation lowest in 5 years (maybe ever, on like-for-like basis?)” . This article generated some interest with our readers, and elsewhere .In this article, Paul invited meteorologists to provide more context to our readers that would help them understand climate factors that would contribute to the observed drought. Josh Fisher, from WeatherZone, has answered that call with the following article. We thank him for this, on behalf of our readers. During June, abnormally high pressure over southern Australia and a resulting lack of cold fronts last month saw large swathes of the country register significantly below average rainfall, warmer than usual days and cool nights during June. Another notable feature of the higher pressure and lack of significant cold fronts, was a lack of wind across southern Australia . This pattern during June was largely driven by a climate driver known as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) . The SAM describes the north–south movement of the westerly wind belt that circles Antarctica, dominating the middle to higher latitudes of the southern hemisphere. Over the past month, the SAM remained predominantly in a positive phase. During a positive phase of SAM, the belt of westerly winds and fronts that circulate the Southern Ocean tend to contract closer to the pole and Australia can see less frontal activity impacting the mainland. As such, winds tend to be weaker over southern Australia , which is what we saw during June. The SAM is remaining positive into July with strong high pressure systems expected to dominate in the weeks to come. There are some indications that the positive SAM could begin to breakdown during the second half of July, which could see potential for more frontal activity. Here’s two specific questions I was asked, and my responses: Q1) How common is this SAM? When was the last time it happened? How predictable is it? The SAM is a mode of atmospheric variability that oscillates between phases on a weekly to monthly scale. The SAM is influenced by other large scale climate drivers such as the El-Nino Southern Oscillation, though predictability is generally limited to a few weeks in advance. The SAM has predominantly been in a positive phase since autumn, previously having been in a negative phase during late 2016 into the start of 2017. The negative phase during this past summer contributed to sustained heat events in New South Wales during December and January, while seeing cooler changes affecting far southern Australia leading to less extended heat events. Q2) Am I correct in inferring the winds in the northern half of australia are unaffected (QLD and northern NSW)? While the strong high pressure systems we have been seeing this winter have led to lower wind speeds in southern Australia, high pressure systems such as these during the winter can direct stronger southeasterly winds over northern parts of the nation.

    "title": "If spot price outcomes through Q2 2016 were “truly remarkable” then price outcomes for Q2 2017 were off the chart",
    "date": "06-07-2017 08:47:00 AM",
    "content": "Back on 4th July 2016, I posted this review of Q2 (2016) prices and posed the question – whether there was a short-term excursion, or more systemic change in pricing patterns? Well, we have just seen the end of Q2 2017 and, based on the results we’ve seen in similar analysis (posted below) it seems more likely that the changes seen in Q2 are both more systemic , and actually increasing over time . (a) It’s clear that there are a number of factors behind these changes, and that these factors play different weights in different regions; (b) This will have huge implications all the way through the electricity supply chain – for generators, retailers, traders, and for energy users (small and large). For context, I have used the same analytical framework presented a year ago, and just added the results for trading prices across all regions through Q2 at the end. For most regions, they stick out a mile: 1) Average prices in Q2 up across all regions One of the interesting points to keep in mind, with respect to Q2 prices, is that this has (traditionally) been one of the “boring” quarters – with low demand-induced pricing volatility. Last year we saw how time-weighted average prices for Q2 2016 were significantly higher than all prior years, with the exception of the drought-affected Q2 2007. 1a) Queensland trended stats Again, we’re starting at the top of the NEM to work our way around: In these charts, we’re showing Minimum, Maximum and Average Prices over the quarter – and for ease of readability, we’ve moved the quarterly maximum trading (i.e. 1/2 hourly) prices to the Y2-axis and shown this data series as a bar chart. 1. We can see that, for Queensland in Q2 2017, the peak price was well below $1000/MWh (only $256.70/MWh), but this did not stop the time-weighted average climbing above the high level of a year before to reach $85.83/MWh. 2. This has been the second highest result seen across all 19 years of NEM operation , with the only year that was higher was the drought year of 2007 (which took a heavy toll on Queensland’s power generation fleet, along with threatening water supplies to the south-east corner of the state). 3. For those who view high prices as a challenge, Q2 2017 was a worse result than seen in Q2 2016. A result double what was held to be a long-run marginal cost position for power stations what seems like a lifetime ago. Moving south to NSW … 1b) NSW trended price stats Moving into NSW, we see the average price for the Quarter ($93.62/MWh) higher than seen in Queensland, and at $17/MWh higher than the prior year also a higher step upwards: As was the case for Queensland: 1. This high average price was delivered despite a peak price across the whole quarter being only $255.14/MWh (slightly lower than in QLD and in the same trading period – 07:00 on 3rd May 2017, a period in which prices were at similar levels also in VIC, TAS and SA). 2. It was also the second highest result in NSW, exceeded only in the drought-affected Q2 2007. Whilst that year suffered from transient issues, it is looking like what’s affecting prices in the NEM is now more deep-seated, multi-faceted, and systemic. Continuing south to Victoria… 1c) Victoria trended price stats In Victoria, we see , we see the average price for the Quarter break $100/MWh (up at $104.92/MWh) – a gut-wrenching level for the vast majority of energy users in what has traditionally been one of the more “boring” quarters: In Victoria, we see that average Q2 prices have never been higher , across all 19 years of NEM history. We can clearly see in the chart that average wholesale prices in Q2 2017 are up 64% compared to the prior year which was already historically high . This just happens to straddle the closure of Hazelwood – and makes a mockery of both: (i) the roll call of “energy experts” who produced precise forecasts of what the impact of the closure would be; and (ii) the greater number of people who believed one particular batch of forecasts from their favourite consultant. … though please note, to be pedantic, that: (i) it is more than the Hazelwood closure that’s produced this extreme outcome. (ii) most forecasts were focused on retail, and domestic, which means the percent change is lower than the above because of other (non-wholesale) costs loaded in. In March I posted this quick review of how the Q1 2017 Base futures contract for VIC was trading up towards $150/MWh – so from this we can say: (i) thankfully the spot settled somewhat lower than that level (though $104/MWh is still extreme); but (ii) it did show that even “the market”, collectively, did not have a perfect view. It’s also , and is the reason why I have repeatedly noted that forecasting is a mug’s game , and Over the water to Tasmania … 1d) Tasmania trended stats Remembering that Tasmania was faced with massive supply challenges in Q2 2016 (with perilously low hydro reserves coupled with a long-term outage on Basslink) that garnered plenty of media and political attention, it is mind-numbing to see that Q2 2017 was very nearly as bad (despite reasonable hydro reserves and working interconnection, and a fraction of the media attention): The average price seen in Tasmania for Q2 2017 was $114.27/MWh, which was both: 1. Only $3.20/MWh lower than the crisis levels of Q2 2016; and 2. Almost $10.00/MWh higher than those seen in neighbouring Victoria. Finally west to South Australia … 1e) South Australia trended price stats Saving (in this case) the worst for last, we then step over to South Australia where the time-weighted average price for the quarter reached a staggering $115.93/MWh : Here, the situation really does look extreme. 1. The price for Q2 2017 was fully $34.92/MWh higher than the level seen in Q2 2016; and 2. Is clearly the highest Q2 average price South Australia has seen over the 19 year history of the NEM. 3. Was incidentally pretty much spot on the money in terms of where the Q2 2017 Base futures contract was (thinly) traded in South Australia just prior to the start of the quarter ( highlighted in my post here on Hazelwood in March 2017 ). 1f) Summing up average Q2 prices all regions In the following chart, we sum up the sorry state of NEM pricing seen across all regions of the NEM, but particularly in VIC, TAS and SA: In the same vein as last year, the most important take-aways from this analysis should be: 1. That the outcome for Q2 2017 was even more remarkable than Q2 2016; and 2. That it appears that we’re entering a new environment that’s distinctly different from the years that preceded; and 3. That this affects everyone, right across the NEM ; and finally that 4. Those pre-disposed to draw overly simplistic “it was due to … [this one factor]” conclusion are unlikely to be correct , and could be dangerously misleading . With respect to the [this one factor], I have seen a number, including the following: Over-simplification #1 = it’s all due to Hazelwood closure (and Northern before it, and so on) Over-simplification #2 = it’s all due to high gas prices Over-simplification #3 = it’s all due to intermittency Over-simplification #4 = it’s all due to those greedy incumbent gentailers Over-simplification #5 = it’s all due to the wind drought in May/June 2017 Over-simplification #6 = it’s all the outcome of uncertainty and change created in the privatisation of NSW generators, in relation to coal supply re-pricing … and the list goes on… As I noted late last week , our need to rapidly increase the capacity of our thinking, to deal with a greatly increased number of wildly changing variables, currently seems to have far outstripped our collective willingness, or ability, to do this (or, in most cases, even an awareness that this intelligence gap has opened). That’s most likely to end in tears. 2) A majority (in some regions) of prices in the $100’s Once again, if Q2 2016 pricing was unusual, then the pattern of pricing seen in Q2 2017 was mind-blowing . As I did last year, I’ve taken all 4,368 half-hour periods through the quarter (through each of the 19 quarters of the NEM-to-date) and apportioned prices into buckets, depending on the level at which they fell. This delivers 19 discrete curves have then been overlaid on a chart for each region, with particular years of interest highlighted. 2a) Distribution of prices in QLD Starting again at the top of the NEM, here’s the chart for Queensland: I highlighted, last year when I posted the chart above, what were the outlier years at the time: 1. The supply-constrained early years in QLD; 2. The drought year of 2007; 3. The two years of carbon tax; and 4. The massive result for Q2 2016 just passed. However the results for Q1 2017 are even more extreme. Instead of the median price being in the $20/MWh to $30/MWh range, the median price is seen to be up at $83.94/MWh . That’s a staggering increase and is just $2/MWh lower than the all-hours average for the quarter ! To sum up, compounding the staggering rise in prices above $100/MWh we saw occur in Q2 2016 (with the incidence for Q1 2017 being much the same), practically all other prices have shifted up by something like $50/MWh. There were less than 100 half-hours with prices experienced below $50/MWh. 2b) Distribution of prices in NSW Progressing further south, it should probably not surprise readers (by now) that we see a similar pattern: Again we see the distribution for Q2 2017 far exceed the (already extreme) results for Q2 2007 and Q2 2016 (which I noted, last year, were “standing out like sore thumbs”). Prices seen in the carbon tax years, with the uplift of $23/tonne or so factored in, are meagre by comparison. 2c) Distribution of prices in VIC Moving into Victoria, we see the same picture: Last year I highlighted “2007 and 2016 as the standouts” – however those years pale into insignificance to the onslaught of Q2 2017. More than half of all half-hours through the quarter saw spot prices greater than $100/MWh. 2d) Distribution of prices in TAS Down in Tasmania, we see a somewhat different picture – though still with similarities: Remembering that the local issues of 2016 pushed Tasmanian electricity supplies to crisis levels, the distribution curve for prices seen in Q2 2017 is deeply disturbing – with prices under $50/MWh having completely evaporated , and an even higher incidence of prices over $100/MWh (though the reduced instance of “very high” prices, compared with Q2 2016, being the obvious reason why the average in 2017 turned out slightly lower). 2e) Distribution of prices in SA Finally, we land at South Australia and see a truly horrendous picture, with way more than half of all half-hourly prices being more than $100/MWh (i.e. 2,945 half-hours in 4,368 in total – or 67% of the time – almost triple the incidence in Q2 2016 ): Is it any wonder that large energy users are closing their doors, permanently . 2f) Summing up, for all regions Selecting just the incidence of prices above $100/MWh for each region and trending over time, we see the following summary: Quite literally, the incidence for South Australia and Tasmania are both off the chart, with Victoria just scraping in below 2,400 half hours (still more than 50% of the time). This is a far more excessive outcome than either Q2 2016 and Q2 2007 (the drought year), and there seems to be worrying signs that: 1. This is a continued pattern; whilst, all the while 2. Our political leaders fiddle whilst Rome burns…. In a complex system (such as the NEM) it’s almost certain that, with most events, there are always multiple contributing factors . When I have a bit more time, I will return to analysing the various contributing factors – including those identified above…",

    "title": "Where’s the wind gone?  NEM-wide wind farm operation lowest in 5 years (maybe ever, on like-for-like basis?)",
    "date": "30-06-2017 03:21:00 PM",
    "content": "Yikes! One of the advantages of running the full NEM-Watch software continuously as an entry-level dashboard in our office is the progressive education that this delivers – particularly in relation to changing patterns (for a whole range of different variables) that are occurring in this multi-faceted energy transition . One I have been puzzling about recently has been what has seemed to be a much lower production level from wind farms, NEM-wide , than what I had become accustomed to seeing (i.e. given my sense that winter had seen peak wind outputs in prior years). 1) I’ve puzzled about this, but have not had time to dig any more to this point. 2) Coincidentally, I also noticed this article by Stephen Letts at the ABC in catching up with goings on this week noting that Infigen had revised its revenue/production forecasts downwards due to what is implied has been lower wind levels than they had expected. Stephen quotes them as noting: “The current quarter is expected to include two of the lowest production months for Infigen’s current Australian operating assets.” Hence today, I have been able to invest a couple hours to have a bit of preliminary look, using NEM-Review v6 and first produced the following trend of daily average production from all wind farms across the NEM: On the chart I have also included (on the Y2 axis) total Scheduled Demand NEM wide, scaled to allow readers to infer the approximate percentage of total production on the day. Some days we see production has been more than 10% of total Scheduled Demand, some days below 1%, and most mid-way between. Specific stats from these two series of daily aggregates are noted in this table: There clearly are some highs and lows in the above – as would be expected from an intermittent supply: THE HIGHS: Highest percentage contribution up at a large 16.0% on a weekend day (Sunday 30th October) , when total demand was below average (437,152MWh on the day); but A higher total output from wind on Monday 11th July 2016 up at 73,698MWh for the day (part of the reason that I had come to see winter as windier months, I believe). THE LOWS: Wind contributed only a meagre 0.6% on a remarkable day of Thursday 11th May 2017 when everything across the NEM was becalmed (incidentally a day for which load shedding was initially forecast on the Monday , and part of a run of low production days spanning May and June); As noted in the table above, the production of only 3,415MWh on that day represents only 5% of the peak daily output seen 11 months earlier on 11th July, and only 12% of the average over the period. Keen data junkies will have noted the slight simplification I have made in this analysis, in that I have used Scheduled Demand instead of the (slightly larger) Operational Demand as the denominator. Please keep this in mind if quoting the percentages (i.e. the percentages above will be slightly higher than the “real” percentages would be). Chunking the data up to monthly totals through NEM-Review , and so extending the time span back to January 2010 we see the expected growth in wind output as an increasing number of wind farms are commissioned over the 8 year period. As can be seen, aggregate production is progressively climbing, as a percentage of aggregate “Scheduled Demand” to be fairly consistently around the 5% mark. This growth makes the remarkable low point of June 2017 stand out like a sore thumb : As highlighted on this chart, we have to go back to April 2012 (just over 5 years ago) to see a lower aggregate production from wind. That’s truly astonishing . Considering that there have been many new wind farms commissioned in the 5 year period (like Hornsdale in July 2016 and Ararat in August 2016 ), it does beg two questions: 1) More academically, on a like-for-like basis, has the aggregate wind output ever been lower? 2) More practically (and very importantly), where has the wind gone, and why? On a monthly basis, I have included the same table structure as above, for those who think numerically. One standout for me has what’s happened over the past 6 or 7 weeks, including the low of 11th May. 1) Where has the wind gone? This is not just an academic question, but one that should be the focus of considerable attention , given the high likelihood that the NEM of the future will be heavily dependent on wind as one of two main intermittent supplies. Even assuming large amounts of battery storage in place to enable time-shifting of energy, seeing that total wind generation in June 2017 is under half of the level seen in May 2016 (highest month thus far), despite the new wind farms commissioned over 12 months, does raise concerns about ensuring we have enough (and what that might cost)! Perhaps May/June will continue being the period of extremes – I note, as well, that the lowest production in the 8 year period was seen in May 2010. I’ve posted this article here, and will follow up directly with some of our regular readers in the various weather forecasting/watching businesses that serve NEM participants and others to see if they are able to provide an explanation: (a) Either a shorter one in comments below; or (b) As their own follow-on post. 2) What are the implications Now (hopefully) before some of our readers jump on their chosen hobby horse at either extreme of the Emotion-o-Meter , let me just reiterate my position that the glass can be half-full and half-empty at the same time: 2a) To the “sky will fall in” people on the far right This actual occurrence of a massive drop in wind production over 13 months (May 2016 to June 2017), including a huge step down from May 2017 to June 2017 does not mean the energy transition can’t be achieved …. 2b) To the “she’ll be right mate, just go faster” people on the far left … it does, however, indicate that we (as an industry) need to be far more sophisticated in our approach to planning, business development and operations than has been the case to date & that the mechanisms that have got us to where we are ( the RET being one of them) are not going to be good enough to get us where we need to go. PS Factors contributing to low wind farm output, NEM-wide, in June [comments added on 3rd July] Thanks for the various comments (below, over on Twitter and LinkedIn, elsewhere online, and also directly). It all helps me to understand better. Summing up so far, there are at least three factors contributing (we’ll post more as a separate articles on WattClarity, as time permits): Factor 1) Low wind speeds First and foremost, there have been some of the lowest wind speeds recorded for many-a-year. I’m still hunting up an explanation from those who know far more than me about this, in terms of: (a) What has caused this; and (b) How likely it is to happen again. Factor 2) Possible Plant problems? I have been told that Boco Rock Wind Farm (in NSW) has experienced some serious technical problems with rotor bearings. A quick check with NEM-Review shows that they had low output from 8th to 23rd June, but I have not had time to check further… Factor 3) Aggregate output constrained down in SA Coincidentally, over on RenewEconomy here, Giles posted this article on Monday 3rd July to highlight recent constraints on wind farm output. When time permits, I will delve into more detail over a longer time period (i.e. the months above) to see what effect this will have had on average outputs",

    "title": "Another industrial energy user enters Liquidation (in South Australia this time)",
    "date": "26-06-2017 03:21:00 PM",
    "content": "After taking a week away last week, I’ve skimmed the many pages of energy sector media reports and commentary to catch up. One particular snippet caught my eye, for a number of reasons – noting that another industrial energy user in South Australia has gone into Liquidation . There are bound to be other reasons (not specific to the electricity sector) that contributed to the demise of this particular business. However I know for sure that electricity prices were one of the contributing factors – as explained below. 1) Serious pricing shocks Back in July 2016, I posted this article about the remarkable pricing patterns seen in Q2 2016 . To reduce the risk of readers jumping to the wrong conclusions here (at either end of of the Emotion-o-Meter ) let me quickly note three things: 1a) These price shifts were seen across all regions; 1b) They occurred due to a multitude of factors; and 1c) Both the level of prices, and uncertainty surrounding them ( even back in June 2016 ) were posing a significant risk to many commercial businesses for whom electricity consumption forms a non-trivial input cost. Since Q2 2016, however, the situation has only become worse . There was the sky-high volatility of July in SA followed on by security-of-supply shocks in South Australia and NSW, and huge volatility in QLD. This can be seen in the following trend produced in NEM-Review v6: Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a rational end in sight. 2) A growing disconnect between the supply side and the demand side Reflecting on the volume of media attention focused on the energy-sector over the past week as I scanned through both hard copy and electronic records, I could not help but reflect on the very low percentage of the coverage that seemed to take into consideration the very valid concerns commercial and industrial energy users have about the abysmal way in which this energy transition is being managed. Whilst there are many businesses facing existential questions about closing up shop (or moving offshore, if that is an option for them) the supply-side of the energy sector seems to be continuing a circular finger-pointing exercise about “who’s to blame” for the mess that we’re in. I’ve already noted about how our current crop of politicians (at state and federal level, across all political parties) are doing much the same – now with barely pause for breath after the release of the Finkel review. Like a macabre game of “musical chairs”, I wonder how many energy users will be departing the scene as the fiddler plays and Rome burns … 2a) Spot exposure for Demand Response, as a last resort for the business in question The particular energy user in question (who I cannot name) came to us at the end of 2016 with the only option left available to them being taking spot exposure, whilst hoping to physically hedge the risks inherent in this approach through the use of our software. Approaches like these are not a surprise to us, given the price shocks above. There have been a significant number of calls we’ve received in the latter months of 2016 – a trend which has continued into 2017: (i) We are probably (at least by some measures) the largest supporter of Demand Response in the NEM . (ii) Our software has been used by a range of energy users, across all regions, to help them manage the physical risk associated with the “real time pricing” method of Demand Response . However, a rushed implementation of demand response is not in anyone’s best interests : (i) At best it means that the benefits delivered are sub-optimal to the energy user, at worst they can be counter-productive if poorly implemented. (ii) Which is why we will sometimes work one-on-one with energy users contemplating going to down this path to help them understand the nuances of this new approach ( Step 1 = Educate ) and then explore how it would work for them ( Step 2 = Define the business case ). (iii) We’re also happy to work with a range of Retail Energy Brokers* to help them understand how this method of demand response is already working in the NEM. * In our experience, most Retail Energy Brokers don’t understand wholesale market dynamics all that well – and hence are blindsided to changes they see in retail contract price offers provided by retailers when they pursue their more “traditional” re-contracting processes. This, unfortunately, seems to be one factor leading to the sudden rush of energy users who’ve called us up as a last resort. Unfortunately, it seems that what we could do to help this particular energy user was a case of “(too little?), too late” – as a result of which they have sadly closed their doors. 2b) Demand Destruction, more generally On WattClarity we have been posting insights about declining demand in the NEM for almost 10 years now. Back in 2011, I posted this list of factors all contributing to the pattern of declining demand . Unfortunately in some circles, the variety of factors have been forgotten and a simplified view has emerged (for some) that this has just been a substitution of wholesale generation for production behind the meter (primarily solar PV, but also a bit of cogen and other). Because of time constraints, and also the opacity of solar PV I have previously posted about , I am unable to contribute more analysis in this area today – but suffice to say that solar PV is only one of a number of factors . Business closures like this reinforce this to me – however I wonder what percentage of those involved in the ongoing debate about the energy transition will be aware of notices like these (given the splintering of social media leading to some people only listening to others who reinforce their own existing belief systems)? There seems to be a disconcerting number of people who would actually celebrate such demand destruction (facetiously it could be pointed out that such demand destruction would be the surest way for a particular location to achieve some form of “X% by 20YY” renewable energy target). There are a number of examples I’ve seen that seem to corroborate this feeling, such as: 2a) Our guest author, Jim Snow noted a similar experience in his article back on 2nd June , paraphrasing the sense he’d gained from talking with a number of renewables proponents. Jim said: “ Price and even reliability are seen in the short terms as acceptable collateral damage to ensure the eradication of fossil fuels from the energy supply in this ideological battle.” 2b) Internationally, I have seen it noted a number of times by proponents of Energiewende in Germany , that the high prices paid for electricity are something that should be celebrated (i.e. as a lever to incentivise lower consumption, hence reduced emissions – because of demand elasticity). I’ve seen similar things noted about the NEM, as well. Challenging times ahead, indeed….",

    "date": "06-06-2017 03:27:00 PM",
    "content": "A quick post today following questions from some about the package of measures announced by the Queensland Government yesterday and over the weekend aimed at reducing electricity prices in the Queensland regions. These measures were described in this press release here (including some tweets over the weekend by the Minister for Social Media (oops Energy)), were covered in the AFR by Mark Ludlow and in the Australian by Sarah Elks . Accessing an early beta of our NEMreview v7 software (as noted here, all v6 clients already have access to this ), I quickly through together the following trend of Base Load futures prices for the following four quarters. A drop in prices can be seen for yesterday compared to prior weeks – for which the Government’s announced raft of changes will presumably have contributed. Some starting questions… Q1) What would have been? Would the price have dropped in the absence of the Government’s announcements – and, if so, by how much? That’s a much harder (if not impossible) question to answer… Q2) Directions to generators? … and then there’s an imponderable question about what the following direction to Stanwell Corporation from the QLD Energy Minister actually means (quote in the article in the Australian, linked above): “We are going to direct them to maximise output while … staying profitable … Um, what does that actually mean … maximise volume BUT stay profitable? Why was CS Energy also not (apparently?) given the same direction. Q3) Prioritising electricity over gas? Bringing Swanbank E back from mothballs will (presumably) help to reduce electricity spot prices when it runs – but also (just as presumably) will have the effect of further increasing spot gas prices in the STTM. Is it the intention of the policy to favour electricity over gas? … more questions later…",

    "title": "Energy Supply Disruption – Understand the Customer Drivers",
    "date": "02-06-2017 12:13:00 PM",
    "content": "The energy supply industry is now a case study of major disruption and this is causing chaos. We are now witnessing the simultaneous high prices in electricity and gas – importantly at the commodity level – not network driven this time – although that just changed with the AER loss – more petrol on the fire. This is causing a major economic restructuring of energy intensive industries and even those where these uncontrollable cost increases are sufficient to deplete competitiveness. Because of this, no business is spared and even relatively small energy users such as tourism are being heavily effected, and even the less visible energy intensive industries like the food processing sector are seeing major restructuring. And there is it seems no relief in sight. Historically once the tipping point is reached in business competitiveness the restructuring is very rapid – often within a 2-year timeframe, with high levels of redundancies involved. We are well into that process. Therefore, the energy supply industry is seeing decline in energy demand as it is taken away by these customer demand responses, by the rapid take up of alternatives such as solar PV – both embedded and grid connected (an accelerating trend). And now more disruption from embedded network development, which is rapacious and taking out any semblance of growth, and energy storage options that extend the use and effectiveness of renewables. The supply system is also facing a new challenge with serious concerns about the security of grid based supply at peak times – from the potential for gas shortages through to the impacts of the renewables free riding on the existing supply infrastructure. And, what should be a national concern, the forecasting methodologies that continue to be stubbornly used, despite being shown to be clearly failing for the last decade, are in need of simple but effective reform. It is clear that using any form of regression analysis for forecasting in such a disrupted environment is has no credibility at all – forecasting reform needs to be entirely customer focused (a subject for a future blog). So, what is at the core of this massive disruption – how has this become possible? There are two answers – one involves the customers and the other policy. Policy – States in the driving seat On the policy side, we should make no mistake there is an underlying ideological battle over sustainability of energy supply and use that is driving energy policy – it is as simple as that. This is at every level of Government but is particularly dominated at the State level. Every State has some form of emission reduction target in the next 13 to 33 years – from 50% reduction through to zero emissions, and have many other schemes that support solar and energy storage or discriminate against carbon based fuels. Price and even reliability are seen in the short terms as acceptable collateral damage to ensure the eradication of fossil fuels from the energy supply in this ideological battle. The economic restructuring impacts are part of the cost of the solutions to proponents, there is more at stake for those that want to see emissions reduced – the downside from failing will be catastrophic to mankind. And they have tacit community support. And while I have no doubt activists do not want any of these outcomes, in questions put to me during and after presentations on these issues it is clear that the end goal is overriding and that there is a belief that collateral damage would be minimised (or compensated) if they were in charge of the changes. State energy policy is a serious driver on where the energy industry is going. Yes, we have national policy that plays a significant part as well but the really sharp end of change seems to be driven at the state level right now – where it seems to normally retreat to when national policy is seen to be lagging. A good indicator is the moratoria or severe curtailment on gas drilling across nearly all states – only Queensland is free of such constraints. Gas is not wanted as a transition fuel – as “ it just delays the inevitable conversions ”. The coal war for power production (until recently) had largely been won and the proponents have been moving on to the export coal industry. The key here is that States control the natural resources such as coal and gas in the ground, and can (and do) set policies for emission outcomes in their state. Reliability of supply is also seen as a State issue now – it is the state Premier in the gun when a state blacks out. National cohesion is evaporating as States looks after their own – and this is understandable. Customers driving disruption When considering customer responses, the key question to ask is my favourite; one that I have been asking the existing supply industry for some 5 years, and the attempts at answering this question tend to give an indication why it is so. Why are consumers electing to invest their own savings or cash flow into self-generation and turning their back on an electricity supply industry that has been servicing them well for a century – making large parts of it stranded/redundant? The answer lies in consumer (and behavioural) economics: Customers initially were confronted with significant and unpredictable prices rises and so a demand elasticity response was inevitable – the idea that electricity (and even gas) use was inelastic was a nonsense and proved to be the case, Then along came very well subsidised alternatives – policy driven kick starts to the renewables industry – rooftop PV that did reduce customers’ bills at their meters, and continue to do so every day, and These alternatives are more sustainable supply – the customer is contributing to reducing their own emissions while avoiding unpredictable costs – happy days! But even more subliminal was that customers installing solar PV were taking a long-term hedge for part of their usage against the existing industry. Why – because they could get a reasonably well known cost for their solar power over a long term, with a virtual zero short run costs once the initial investment had been made – a product that the energy sector could not supply. Certainty and sustainability – and this came as customers were looking for stability in their household costs. Baby boomers retiring, mortgage stressed families, new home buyers, volatile job markets with higher levels of part time jobs – who of these wants unpredictable price rises? So, the industry response was customers may want sustainable, affordable and reliable energy – the energy trilemma – but can only pick two – not have all three. Smugness then ensues – the existing industry has been validated – you will be sorry you tuned your back on us…when the supply fails who are you going to call? But it is important at this junction to ask: Do they want affordable, reliable but unsustainable energy – business may be keen right now but consumers/voters are showing little interest? Or will they pay more for reliable, sustainable energy – they are certainly paying (a lot) more for the sustainable energy – cash plus subsidies? Or are we in reality close to getting all three but the transition path is about costs – and that consumers have learnt from solar PV – prices will come down The issue is that the more failure ensues and costs have to increase to manage this the more this alienates the existing supply industry and validates the ideologues. And while the ideological battle rages along comes more disruptive but attractive options for customers – innovation occurring at great pace – and not from the existing industry. For example: Right now, corporate customers are signing up for solar grid farm PPA’s for bundled LGC’s and black power – as they are much cheaper but also act as a portfolio based hedge Growth in commercial and industrial site based solar and energy storage plant is also staggering with sophisticated modelling and control to minimise energy costs – amazing developments in this space. Embedded networks , and microgrids are growing at pace – taking market share from networks, generators and retailers They can supply the customer’s energy, water and waste water needs and reticulated broadband using fibre to the premise – as well as many other bundled services – at scale Developers and body corporates are establishing this model as a true alterative for customers with stand-alone systems or options that are co-optimised with the network, with the network having a very different role Highly competent new businesses are being established – and many will move on to take full retail licences Viral consumer battery based trading – e.g. grid credits by Reposit Power, AGL trials, in house energy apps – could we see 1 GWh/year added – Vic and SA Battery grid projects – distributed asset management – customer latent demand – demand response from controllable devices? So, if the current supply is expensive, unreliable and infrastructure solutions to this are even more expensive – it is no wonder the disrupters are winning – after all they are the only ones who will visit you in your home and sell you the sustainable solution package – when was the last time your retailer spoke to you about savings, sustainable supply, solutions – let alone visiting you in your home? The industry needs to relearn how to engage with and deal with customers, how to intelligently use channels to market and how to develop and supply real (competitive) options with maximum speed to market – get out of commodity and infrastructure mode – rediscover “customers” – we knew a lot more about them in the 1990’s when there was fuel on fuel competition than we do today. Networks and the traditional Retailers have serious competition that is disrupting at pace – it is time to respond even if that means totally refocusing the business models.

    "date": "08-05-2017 09:56:00 PM",
    "content": "On Thursday night last week (coincidentally whilst in Melbourne for activities in the battery storage space ) I noticed the news commentary about the planned strike at Loy Yang A, so posted this quick first article . UPDATE ON THE FOLLOWING These Market Notices were cancelled by AEMO at 22:00 on Monday 8th May Back in Brisbane this week, I had planned to have more of a look at how the week unfolded – so was not really surprised to see the way NEM-Watch looked at 12:05 today: Key point highlighted on this image are the 2 warnings published by AEMO on Sunday evening, warning of load shedding in both Victoria and South Australia in the evening of Thursday 11th May . I meant to post more earlier, but have hardly been in the office. Given the late time this evening, it’s no surprise that Sunday’s warnings have been superseded with the following warnings for both Victoria and South Australia, published at 16:00 today (Monday) – and pertain to Thursday 11th May, and also considerably larger on Monday 15th May : 1) Load shedding forecast for Victoria Starting with Victoria, we see some (relatively minor) load shedding forecast for Thursday 11th May, in the morning and the evening – but (now that the ST PASA window spans out till next week) we also see massive load shedding forecast for the evening of Monday 15th May: As noted on this image for Victoria, the amount of load shedding forecast for Victoria on Monday evening would equate to more than 10% of the entire demand of Melbourne . 2) Load shedding forecast for South Australia In South Australia, we see load shedding forecast to coincide with the same days – but next Monday morning (not evening, as in Victoria) : More challenging times ahead, in what is proving to be a very, very rocky energy transition (one which, it seems to me, has been made much rockier than it needed to be by act and by omission by a number of different stakeholders, including those at both ends of the Emotion-o-meter – more on my sense of the “Root Causes”, and potential way forward, later….) [UPDATE] 3) Supply-side contributions in Victoria Powering up ez2view (the higher-end tool) we can look in considerably more detail at a wide variety of AEMO (and other) data – and I have included two particular snapshots from the “Forecast Convergence” widget focused on AEMO’s forecast for the Victorian region out over the coming week: 3a) Forecasts for Available Generation (of Scheduled capacity) In the first grid view, we see a forecast of aggregate generation ability provided by all generators in Victoria which are required to submit bids through the ST PASA process (i.e. this is the traditional generation plant). Out this far we don’t know their bid prices, but we can see what’s available. As can be seen, what we assume as the planned shut-down of the Loy Yang A station from 10th May (i.e. earlier than the strike action slated for 15th May) stands out like a sore thumb . 3b) Forecasts for Wind Output (Semi-Scheduled and Non-Scheduled) In the second grid, ez2view has performed a slightly more complex query to show what the AEMO is currently forecasting to be the aggregate output of all the wind farms across Victoria . Unfortunately, we see that (unlike Saturday 6th May, when the wind output was relatively high), we’ve entered a “doldrums week” where the contribution from wind looks set to be fairly low all week (thankfully climbing out of the deep blue next Monday 15th in the current forecasts). 3c) Neither Thermal nor Wind are seen to shine Hence we see that neither aggregate wind nor selected thermal plant are covering themselves in glory in this set of forecasts…",

    "date": "04-05-2017 06:53:00 PM",
    "content": "“Interesting times” in the broader business environment in Victoria currently – with a number of Fairfax journalists out of action in response to redundancy plans and (today) AGL’s announcement that it plans to shut down the whole of the Loy Yang A power station following from the decision of 15 ETU members to strike from Monday 15th May. Here’s some coverage in the Australian and also in the FinReview . Having a quick look at the PASA window of ez2view reveals the scale of the interruption: As seen in the snapshot above, the decision was taken by AGL sometime between the 12:00 and 15:00 MT PASA Region Availability data updates – and hence communicated to the market via AEMO’s data delivery process. Given that the market became aware of the closure decision at 15:00 (hence before closure of trading at ASX Energy) I was curious to see what the market response was across this small period. Hence I powered up the early beta of NEMreview v7 (access provided to clients already) to generate the following trend: Caution, when reading this chart, in understanding that the raw spot prices are shown on the LHS axis and futures prices on the right. Hence we can clearly see the Q2, Q3 and Q4 prices trading (currently) higher than where the Q1 price settled at the end of the Q1 period – partly in response to the Hazelwood closure. I’d expect to see the futures prices trade higher tomorrow as the Loy Yang A industrial action becomes more widely known. Frequent readers of WattClarity will recall the prior coverage of announced industrial action before Christmas (though that did not proceed).",

    "title": "More about wind output and AEMO’s intervention in South Australia 25-26 April",
    "date": "01-05-2017 02:55:00 PM",
    "content": "As highlighted in Paul’s original article , windfarm output in South Australia reached an all-time record of 1,541 MW just before midnight on Tuesday last week (25th April), during a windy 24 hour period. In this followup I’ll look a bit more closely at this event and some of the actions taken by AEMO to maintain system security in South Australia. Here’s an overview of the supply mix in SA over the two days, including AEMO’s estimates of rooftop PV production: Production from renewable sources – large scale wind and small-scale PV (while a number are under construction or planned, no large scale PV plants are operating yet in SA) – dominated the supply mix throughout much of this two day period, with the the renewable contribution to local SA demand above 80% from about midday on Anzac Day through to mid afternoon on April 26 (except for a few hours in the evening peak), and at times exceeding 100%. The interconnectors between SA and Victoria were therefore mostly exporting power from SA to Victoria over the period, at combined levels of up to 570 MW. Despite these levels of export, overall capacity across the Heywood and Murraylink interconnectors was high enough to ensure that there were virtually no constraints on overall SA to Vic flow, while prices in South Australia remained positive except for a single dispatch interval, and there were no material restrictions on windfarm output (via the “semi-dispatch” process in which AEMO can instruct windfarms to produce at lower than available capability, either to manage network constraints or because prices fall below levels at which those windfarms have offered to produce – generally negative). However as flagged in Paul’s article, with high wind output and relatively low levels of online thermal generation AEMO did have to take a number of steps to maintain system security. This was first flagged in a Market Notice issued very early on Tuesday morning: This ez2view schematic view of South Australia for the Dispatch Interval 03:10-03:15 ( DI 0315 ) shows the situation AEMO’s notice was highlighting: The only thermal units in operation here are one Torrens Island B unit, Pelican Point , and the Osborne cogeneration facility. Pelican Point was in the process of running down before going offline a few dispatch intervals later, in accordance with its previously lodged bids, and had bid itself out of the market for the next “bid day” commencing at 4am, citing the outlook for high wind generation and relatively low spot prices. AEMO’s requirements for minimum thermal generation levels in South Australia are quite complex, and related to a technical characteristic of the power system called “ system strength ” (reflected in what are known as “ fault levels ”) – you can read all about these requirements in this AEMO document , but the key is this section: With only one Torrens Island B unit in operation, Pelican Point about to go offline, and Osborne not in the above list (due to its lower connection voltage of 66kV), these requirements were about to be breached. With no response to its call for a ‘market response’ to the impending breach, AEMO directed gas turbine units at Hallett Power Station to start, in accordance with the second configuration in the list above. The result is shown in this schematic for the next DI: (Although Hallett is offered into the market as a single “aggregated unit”, the station actually comprises 13 physical gas turbines. Eight of these dispatched to minimum load of 2 MW each produce the output shown above and satisfy AEMO’s minimum thermal generation criterion). The reason for AEMO calling for startup of Hallett, rather than say a second Torrens Island B unit, is that the former are fast-start units capable of coming online at short notice (typically 5-10 minutes), whereas it can take several hours or longer for slow-start units like those at Torrens Island to synchronise to the system. Having called for a market response to the predicted breach of the minimum thermal generation requirement, AEMO’s protocol is to wait as long as possible for that response, then to cover an imminent breach via Direction to fast-start units like those at Hallett. Hallett continued running at this level until early afternoon on Tuesday 25th April. In the meantime, AEMO had made a Direction to AGL to start up a second Torrens Island B unit: AEMO’s market notice does not specify the Directed party, but the effect of the direction can be seen in ez2view’s ex-post analysis of bids for Torrens Island Unit B3 showing first the bid in place prior to direction, with no output offered: whereas by 9am AGL had lodged a rebid showing the unit coming online from 10am and citing the AEMO Direction (the actual notice of Direction was made at 0745, as shown in AEMO’s Market Notice): Ultimately it took quite a few hours longer than expected for this second Torrens Island B unit to start and synchronise, hence Hallett continued operating until 14:25 . AEMO’s Direction to AGL remained in place for the rest of Tuesday and was finally lifted at 12:07pm on Wednesday (by which time Pelican Point had come back into the market and AGL had synchronized a third B unit at Torrens Island): Throughout the period where Directions were in place, AEMO was also limiting output on other South Australian thermal units (at Ladbroke Grove and Osborne) and running a mechanism called “Intervention Pricing” to determine market prices, but the complexities of that topic will have to wait for another post.

    "date": "24-04-2017 12:30:00 PM",
    "content": "At the request of a client, we’ve built a very particular dashboard for their specific needs. I can’t show you what it is, but can note that it’s alerted me this morning to the fact that wind farm output across South Australia is likely to be high this Wednesday 26th April (i.e. beyond the predispatch time horizon). This morning saw the forecast as high as 1,320MW, but this did make me wonder – with the build-out of Hornsdale as the newest addition to the fleet, what has been the maximum all-time instantaneous wind production now? So I powered up NEM-review to run a quick query, and generated this trend of monthly extremes over 12 years: As noted on the image, we see that wind production peaked up at 1,434MW (when measured on a half-hourly basis) earlier in April. Zooming in to look at the raw half-hourly data for April reveals the following chart: As can be seen, the high levels of wind production have driven negative spot price outcomes (a symptom of the 2nd stage challenges highlighted in this recent HBR article ). I don’t have time to delve in more detail, but believe that this volume/price relationship will have changed significantly after 1st April and the closure of Hazelwood . One final chart, for today, shows the average of Average Wind to Peak Wind for the month. If increased diversity of wind farm sites across South Australia was seen to be increasing the ratio, then this would be a good thing (i.e. meaning that the challenge would then reduce to catering for the low wind times). However we see that this is not the case – with the ratio (whilst jumping up and down from month-to-month) is not trending significantly upwards. This was one of the challenges I grappled with in this kind of “10x analysis” in 2015 – challenges evidently not going away. We’re yet to see what the yield patterns are like for any wind farms north of Southern NSW. That will be of keen interest!",

    "content": "At 20:30 on Tuesday 18th April 2017, the AEMO issued Market Notice 58400 noting that Administered Pricing had been declared for market ancillary services in South Australia, beginning 20:35 – as shown here via NEM-Watch : We’ve fielded some calls about this pricing event and have prepared some of the following images below to answer direct questions – however we thought it would be of broader interest to our WattClarity readership, so have included here, as well. My apologies, in advance, for any errors or omissions in the following – I’ve run over my budgeted time already so have to post this as-is… (I’m sure some of our more learned readers will be happy to point out these mistakes in comments below). In the first image, I’ve wound NEM-watch back (in the “playback” function we first introduced in 2003 ) to show what the market conditions were for the 11:25 dispatch interval on Tuesday 18th April (so towards the end of the 11:30 Trading Period). For a start, we show the Energy Layer (the one most people focus on, 99% of the time) : As noted on the image, AEMO issued a Market Notice just prior to alert the market to a change in the underlying transmission network, that resulted in new Constraint Sets being invoked (as us if you want to know more about this) – which led to a significant reduction in the transfer capability on the Heywood link. Here’s the full text of that Market Notice: As highlighted at the time, the Heywood link was effectively “hard-wired” such that it had to flow west. Because of the price difference (i.e. buying expensive in VIC to sell cheaper in SA) the flow was dispatched to be as low as it could be. We then flip NEM-watch (still re-wound to 11:25 on Tuesday) to show the Raise Regulation FCAS Service (i.e. the one FCAS service, of 8 in total, where Administered Prices were declared), and we see a few other pieces of information: For a start, we can see the Raise Reg Price for the 11:25 dispatch interval spike up to $14,000/MWh (i.e. the Market Price Cap that applies to each FCAS commodity, as well as to Energy), where it remained for many hours. Powering up NEM-Review and panning back over the past 4 days, we see the summary of Energy and Raise/Lower FCAS prices in South Australia against a backdrop of aggregate local generation: Finally, for those who really want to understand more, I’ve powered up ez2view and Time-Travelled back to 11:25 to look at the specifics of generator bids for Raise Regulation FCAS (narrowed down to just generators in South Australia) . This is shown in the following snapshot: As highlighted on the snapshot: 1) There are precious few generators that offer FCAS in South Australia – for this dispatch interval: (a) There are a number of thermal plant in South Australia that are not offering FCAS services. Some never do, and are not equipped to do so. (b) Despite the fact that it is technically a possibility, there are no wind farms in South Australia (or anywhere in the NEM) that offer FCAS Services. Not for this dispatch interval and not, currently, in any dispatch interval (though there is now a trial being organised for Hornsdale to “dip its toe” in the FCAS waters). (c) There are (yet) no large-scale solar farms in South Australia. I’m not 100% clear on the possibility of solar PV farms providing FCAS – but it’s a moot point until the first one is built. 2) Given the dispatch patterns leading up to the network outage, hence constrained interconnector flow, the only outcome that could supply the necessary local services in South Australia resulted in Pelican Point setting the price with a bid up at the Market Price Cap. Back in April, guest author Jonathon Dyson noted that “Ancillary Services Matter!” (the explanation in that post will help those who are unfamiliar) . The fact that we’re fielding calls now asking about occurrences in the FCAS market is some evidence that the broader energy sector is becoming aware of this fact. For those particularly interested in FCAS, and perhaps relatively new to the topic, then other posts by Kate Summers and Harley MacKenzie will also be of some educational value. Interesting times…",

    "content": "Could not help but notice some news media coverage yesterday (e.g. here and here ) of how the Ararat Wind Farm is now at full capacity. Hence, and especially because we highlighted the start of production on 31st August 2016 , thought I would have a quick look. I powered up NEM-Review v6 to generate the following trended daily output for the Ararat Wind Farm since its first production and, for some comparability, included daily total production from all wind farms based in Victoria (which includes Ararat*): As shown, daily wind production from all wind farms across Victoria has, on rare occasions, topped 24,000MWh (as noted on the image, this is a measure of volume – as distinct from an often-confused “MW” measure of rate ). Also shown is that the best day achieved at Ararat Wind Farm, thus far, was Monday 10th April – when total production of 4,300MWh was produced (or equivalent to a 180MW power plant running flat out over a day). As can be seen, most days have been much lower than that level – particularly (coincidentally) days from the 10th April till now. We’re watching the evolution of the energy sector with very keen interest… * For those who don’t understand (based on questions we receive about the NEM-Watch fuel type widget on RenewEconomy , there are a few!) the ACT Government’s 100% target is sourcing production from many locations across the NEM – not just in the ACT. Hence it can be thought of as more of a consumption-based measure, as distinct from the supply-based measures that the larger state targets take the form of.",

    "title": "Noteworthy analysis of the state-wide blackout across South Australia on 28th September 2016",
    "date": "30-03-2017 03:54:00 PM",
    "content": "Bruce Miller’s post on WattClarity on 30th March 2017 has prompted me to put this record together this listing of reference materials relating directly to the South Australian blackout of 28th September 2016. As more materials come to hand (or are identified by some of our readers – gratefully received) I will seek to keep this update – though it might be sporadic. (A) Coverage on WattClarity Click through here for a fuller list of articles that have been posted in this particular categor y. Of particular note are the following: Date Report or Publication 28th September 2016 (early) As soon as we saw it happening, we posted this brief article to let our readers know, if they were not already aware 28th September 2016 (later) Very late on the day, I posted this animation (using ez2view) of what I could see that had happened . At the time I noted that I would post more analysis later on WattClarity – but have not had the time. 12th August 2019 On Monday 12th August 2019 I extracted two of the illustrations included in the Generator Report Card to provide an illustration of what the instantaneous level of inertia was in the South Australian region on the day of the SA System Black (and how that particular day highlights an inflection point in the trajectory of generator-supplied inertia over a period of approximately 10 years). (B) Reports from the AEMO In the table below, I have linked (in chronological order) to the main reports published by the AEMO analysing what happened in the blackout – the causes, the consequences, and recommendations aimed at reducing the risk of it happening again: Date Report or Publication from the AEMO 5th October 2016 Only a week after the incident, AEMO published a Preliminary operating incident Report : 1) Here’s the HTML note . 2) Here a direct link to the PDF report (referencing information as at 3rd October 2016). This report was only 31 pages in length, so 1/10 of the final size. 19th October 2016 2 weeks later, AEMO published an update – in its Second Preliminary Report : 1) AEMO published this update to the first report . 2) Here’s the PDF . 12th December 2016 Just under 3 months from the incident, the AEMO published some preliminary recommendations in a Third Preliminary Report : 1) The HTML note is here ; whilst 2) The PDF is linked directly here (referenced to information collated as at 7th December 2016). 28th March 2017 5 months after the incident, AEMO published its Final Report : 1) The HTML note is here ; whilst 2) Direct link to the PDF “Black System – South Australia 28th September 2016” is here (now up at 273 pages). (C) Finkel Review The “Finkel Review” was set up following the blackout, but has a broader scope than just analysing this particular incident. For completeness it is listed below: Date Report or Publication 14th December 2016 On the 14th December 2016, a preliminary report was published: 1) HTML reference is here . 2) The PDF report (66 pages) is linked directly here . This Erratum was also published . See the Case Study on page 31 Interim A range of records being related to the Finkel Review are assembled here on the Department of Environment & Energy website . 9th June 2017 The final report is currently available on the Department website at this location . 23rd June June 2017 Note that (underneath the final report) supporting information was published a couple weeks later at this same location . (D) From the AER Thanks to Allan’s comment (below) I have started the listing here: Date Report or Publication from the AER 3rd March 2017 As Allan noted in his comment (below) on 30th March, the AER Quarterly Compliance report talks about certain investigations being completed – some of which relate to the SA blackout: 1) Website page is here . 2) Direct link to PDF document is here . See, in particular, p23 (section 2.4.1) where the AER talks about their responsibilities in terms of reviewing: 1) Pre-event 2) Event 3) System Restoration; and 4) Market suspension. 14th December 2018 The AER released its “The Black System Event Compliance Report” here , which is an investigation into the Pre-event, System Restoration, and Market Suspension aspects surrounding the 28 September 2016 event. The larger (200 page) report is summarised in this 3-page Fact Sheet . 7th August 2019 As noted in this news release from the AER , the AER commenced proceedings in the Federal Court against four wind farm operators for alleged breaches of the National Electricity Rules (NER).Proceedings have been brought against subsidiaries of: AGL Energy Limited (ASX: AGL) in relation to the Hallett 1, Hallett 2, Hallett 4 and Hallett 5 Wind Farms (Suzlon turbines); Neoen SA in relation to the Hornsdale Wind Farm (Siemens turbines); Pacific Hydro Pty Ltd in relation to the Clements Gap Wind Farm (Suzlon turbines); and Tilt Renewables Limited (ASX: TLT) in relation to the Snowtown 2 Wind Farm (comprising Snowtown Wind Farm Stage 2 North and Snowtown Stage 2 South Wind Farm) – Siemens turbines. 28th February 2020 As noted in this news release , the AER published an update on their Black System Event Compliance Report (which had been published on 14th December 2018 and is linked above). The AER says “All but one of the recommendations and remedial actions outlined in the Report have now been implemented.” . (E) From the AEMC Thanks to Allan’s comment (below) I have started the listing here: Date Report or Publication from the AEMC 6th January 2017 As Allan noted in his comment (below), the AEMC initiated their “Review of the System Black Event in South Australia on 28 September 2016” (REF EPR0057). I’ve directly linked the Terms of Reference , provided by the COAG Energy Council. As Allan has noted the date for the AEMC report is 6 months after the completion of both: 1) the AEMO’s investigation report (28 March 2017 – above); and 2) the AER’s compliance report (not released yet, but will be linked above). This currently means not before September 2017, I think. As more substantial documentation is provided, I will include below… 11th July 2017 The AEMC published this 4 page update of their progress (which was, itself, a review of other documentation available). 18th April 2019 The AEMC released this “Issues and Approach paper” to facilitate public comment on: the systemic issues arising from the 28 September 2016 South Australian black system event the Commission’s approach to conducting its review into the event as required by COAG Energy Council. 15th August 2019 The AEMC released this Staff Discussion Paper entitled “Mechanisms to enhance resilience in the power system – Review of South Australia Black System Event” as part of the Review of the System Black Event in South Australia on 28 September 2016 . Thu 12th Dec 2019 The AEMC published this Final Report “Mechanisms to enhance resilience in the Power System – Review of the South Australian Black System Event” . The final report identifies a need to introduce new operational tools for enhancing power system resilience. These operational tools are needed to enhance to manage the risks from ‘indistinct’ events. The review presents detailed recommendations for changes to NER frameworks for power system security in the following three areas: Implementing a General Power System Risk review (GPSR) process is recommended to effectively identify emerging risks to power system from all sources. Introduction of ‘protected operation’ is recommended as a new operational tool for AEMO to enhance the resilience of the power system to indistinct events that are associated with abnormal conditions. Clarifying the applicability of rule arrangements during a period of market suspension . The review also recommends clarifying the applicability of rule arrangements during a period of market suspension The final report includes suggested rule change requests to assist stakeholders develop rule change requests to implement the recommendations made in the review. The review also recommends a future work program investigating further approaches for enhancing power system resilience. The AEMC intend to work closely with AEMO and the Energy Security Board in implementing this future workstream. Will there be any more? Not sure if there will be any more? (F) Miscellaneous Reporting There’s many pages of commentary (or Mb electronically) that’s been published – when I notice something significant that I want to keep a ready reference to, I’ll add it to the table below: Date Report or Publication from the AEMC 10th May 2017 Margarida Pimentel (who was at ACIL Allen Consulting at the time) posted some comments in the “Insights” section of the ACIL Allen website. They were originally attributed to Margarida, but (as at August 2019) have now moved on the website to here and attributed to Paul Hyslop . They might be useful to some people 9th Oct 2018 I also came across this brief article about “Measures for Managing South Australian Power System Accounting for Lessons Learned from the Recent Blackout Event” on the website of the (international) Energy Systems Integration Group, of which the AEMO is a member. It’s written by Babak Badrzadeh who was Manager Operational Analysis and Engineering at AEMO at the time of the article.",

    "title": "Adding a Slice of Cheese",
    "date": "30-03-2017 11:23:00 AM",
    "content": "The South Australian Blackout of 28 th September 2016 is not as simple as it looks. All engineering failures typically have multiple causes. As the cheddar cheese metaphor implies, it is often the case that a series of events all line up (like the holes in a block of cheese) to cause a major disaster like a state wide black out. At the time or immediately after the event it is often unclear as to what happened and when until a detailed analysis is done. At the time of writing, AEMO have produced four reports on the event ( now linked individually here for ease of reference ). This article highlights just one issue relating to the Blackout event. Arguably it may not be as important compared to some of the other issues that occurred on the day, but in terms of its overall importance to the power system in general, I believe it deserves a lot more attention than it has been given to date. The issue is “poor system frequency control” caused by inappropriate generator governor settings. It is arguable that better frequency control could have prevented the SA blackout of 2016. The final report produced by AEMO ( press release here ) contains the following statements pertaining to the most important synchronous generators that were on line that day – three units from Torrens Island Power station. The three TIPS B generating units were each enabled to provide 15 MW of 6-second contingency FCAS prior to the event. However, the frequency in SA prior to separation was only just below the level where FCAS delivery is required to begin, until after the loss of the Heywood Interconnector at 16:18:15.8 The rapid decline in system frequency following loss of the Heywood Interconnector did not allow time for more substantial governor response from these units, as it can take up to six seconds for these generating units to increase their active power output when they participate in the contingency FCAS market. It is the position of this article that these points should be examined and expanded on much more closely than they have been to date; not necessarily because of the events that occurred on the 28 th September 2016, but because frequency control across the whole NEM is very important and has been very poorly served by the existing FCAS arrangements. Hypothetically if good governor control had been enabled in SA that day, it is possible that the load increase across the Heywood Interconnector would have been mitigated, and this may have been enough to prevent the trip of the interconnector and subsequent collapse and blackout. It is also possible that (assuming the Heywood interconnector does trip) fast acting governor control may have slowed the rate of frequency decline and allowed time for load shedding systems to operate, thus avoiding total system black. Frequency Control As both scenarios are entirely hypothetical we will never know if either intervention would have been enough, but that is not the issue. The key issue is that poor frequency control across the NEM has been allowed to develop. If good frequency control had been available it might have helped or even saved the day which would have been the case if generator governors had been active and properly tuned. This also applies for any possible future events. The paper presented by Ms K. Summers at the Wind energy Forum of 2017 recently organised by the Clean Energy Council has demonstrated that the following has occurred: Synchronous generation has progressively detuned its governor control systems, increased governor dead bands or even switched off speed governing altogether in order to avoid the possibility of dispatch errors and incur a possible financial penalty. Reliance has increased on Area grid control to regulate system frequency which is (by design) a much slower control loop compared to local speed droop governing. This combined with Energy management system (EMS) communication and processing delays have led to control system hunting behaviour often resulting in continuously slowly oscillating system frequency which can be easily confirmed by viewing the FACS causer pays four second data. The FCAS market has sometimes led to market regions being left with no frequency control enabled, most notably in South Australia immediately prior to the blackout event of 2016, but also (more worryingly for the whole system security) for the major load and generation centre of NSW. The control of frequency is very important to the NEM as a whole. Anything (FACS markets included) which loosens this control puts the whole system at risk. We would support a comprehensive review of the FCAS market to investigate whether an overhaul would address the undesirable outcomes identified above. However, given that the financial value of FCAS markets is small compared to that of the energy markets, we would question whether even a perfectly-designed FCAS market would address and reduce the cost impact of infrequent, but high cost system disturbances such as (in the worst case) a system wide black out. These risks to the power system are obvious to power system engineers but we appreciate that this may not be the case for the general public, or even for engineering professionals whose expertise lies in other fields. As a result we have to fall back on analogies to explain the issues. Imagine if you had a situation which provided incentives for car manufacturers to disconnect the accelerator pedal and the brakes. For this situation to be practical everything would be fine as long as the car is always able to roll along at constant speed, but what happens if you need to change speed by hitting the brakes or accelerating? Without brakes or accelerator your risk of crashing the vehicle is very much higher. In effect this is the situation the FCAS and energy markets are jointly incentivising. Most generators on the system avoid contributing to the control of system frequency so that when an event occurs the whole system is put at greater risk. Region wide black outs are more likely to be the end result of system events which would normally only result in localised loss of supply. It can be argued that all we need to do is modify the FCAS markets to ensure the incentives are there for generators to provide appropriate governing support, but in practice this interferes with the main energy market, and nearly two decades of market design has failed to resolve these issues. A Simpler Approach There are currently rule changes under consideration which aim to introduce new FCAS markets (inertia and fast frequency response) which are aimed at addressing these issues. These appear to add complexity to an already overly complex market design and recent history shows that complex markets are unlikely to lead to desirable outcomes. Accordingly it may be preferable to consider a much simpler approach. Why don’t we ensure (via appropriate rules and technical standards) that all new generation technologies contribute to frequency control and adjust the market to remove penalties that currently exist for generators when they act to provide good frequency control? This would be fair to all generation participants and result in much better system control which would ultimately be of benefit to all users of the system. This general approach is already adopted for reactive power and voltage control, so a precedent already exists. The prevailing dogma argues that an FCAS market will deliver an efficient outcome for frequency control. As detailed in the paper presented at the wind industry forum of 2017, it is obvious that nearly two decades of FCAS markets has so far achieved the opposite outcome. An annual cost of several million dollars allocated to FCAS services (and related relaxation of standards) has actually resulted in worse frequency regulation than existed prior to the introduction of the NEM. To revert back to analogies, you may get a slightly cheaper car if you buy one without brakes, but it would be the pedestrian you mow down who pays the ultimate price of this dogmatic acquiescence to current economic fashions which seem to dictate you need a market for everything. Security – be it for power systems or for general police forces don’t need to be directly marketable. They simply provide a well maintained background environment in which a market can operate. A well maintained and secure system is needed to allow energy to be traded across the market. If the ancillary services are not there this cannot occur, but it is not necessary and we believe recent history shows may not even be desirable that the ancillary services themselves be procured via market mechanisms – even if these mechanisms were perfect which for the NEM they demonstrably are not. In the context of the NEM, it is not individual pedestrians at risk, but whole regions, or even the whole east coast of Australia exposed to the increased risk of blackout –consequential damage to equipment (significantly this would include generators in particular) and to the population at large.

    "title": "End of an era at Hazelwood",
    "date": "30-03-2017 10:32:00 AM",
    "content": "Over the 10 years that WattClarity has been running, we’ve seen a number of coal-fired power stations close – some of these closures being documented in other articles in WattClarity , as noted in the table below: DATE REGION STATION COMMENTS May 2016 SA Northern Closure of Northern was flagged in June 2015 , but did not close for another 11 months – on 9th May 2016 . Aug 2015 VIC Anglesea Anglesea closed in mid 2015 in conjunction with the closure of the Point Henry aluminium smelter. Sept 2014 VIC Morwell The small Morwell (Energy Brix) plant closed during September 2014. July 2014 NSW Redbank Redbank (a single unit station) began an outage at the end of July – however in November 2014 it was announced that the station would not return from outage . Hence Notice Period was essentially NIL. March 2014 NSW Wallerawang In this article of September 2013 , we noted a change in AEMO’s PASA projection and speculated that it might be due to impending Wallerawang closure. The scale of these (and other) closures is seen in the following chart from NEM-Review v6 , which charts the monthly total production from a selection of the coal plant which have closed over the years: As can be clearly seen, Hazelwood is easily the largest of these stations – and it also happens to be close to the top, in terms of emissions intensity of those in this listing (and certainly the most emissions intensive of the stations still operating in the NEM): With the possible exception of the Northern Power Station in South Australia, none of the above seem to have attracted such vehement opposition from the large and vocal group of people keen to see the station closed in order to improve the emissions intensity of the electricity sector. As such, I thought it might be worth documenting the demise of Hazelwood on this post on WattClarity … (A) Leading up to this week… The decision to close Hazelwood was announced on 3 November 2016 and hence reflected as a big step change in MT PASA . This announcement was only 4 short months ago – a short notice period that has attracted the ire of some participants, and which will be the subject of further commentary on WattClarity at another time . Leading up to this announcement, there was much speculation that it was coming down the pipeline – and, included in the speculation, all sorts of prognoses about how the closure would affect electricity prices (wholesale and retail, in Victoria and elsewhere). Hence on 2nd November 2016 I posted these cautions for those being too sure of exactly what would eventuate – which could be summed up by noting that “ forecasting is a mug’s game ” . Earlier than that, I posted these comments on 26th September 2016 about how the station output and spot revenue had trended over time . On 14th March 2017, I posted these comments about how futures pricing was ramping up in Victoria prior to the closure of the Hazelwood plant. (B) Through the week As we walked through the week, it was with with a slightly unsettling fascination that we watched all 8 units turn off (with associated communications on social media), as follows: (B1) Sunday 26th March 2017 On Sunday afternoon, this snapshot from ez2view (focused on the Victorian region) has recorded one of the last times we’ll see all 8 units at Hazelwood Power Station running. Despite the inputs from the 15 units across 4 stations, we see electricity prices up above $100/MWh in this snapshot from 15:30 NEM time (so 16:30 Melbourne daylight savings time) despite the fact that it’s only modest demand levels across the NEM . As noted a number of times on WattClarity before, occasions like this highlight the diabolical challenges facing the electricity supply sector in the coming 10-20 years (and especially for endangered energy-intensive industrial facilities given coincident structural challenges for all of the fuel types highlighted here: 1) Starting with coal-fired generation , which is in structural decline due to the externalities of climate change (and flow-on effects); 2) We see gas-fired generation bidding significantly higher than it would have in yester-year, by virtue of the export parity pricing that is now commonplace and national ; 3) We see wind generation going missing again, illustrating the challenge of the not nearly enough diversity that our approach to this energy transition has delivered, to date; 4) Not shown on this image, but a factor in every afternoon period, is the decline in solar output through the afternoon (discussed before here); 5) We also see minimal output from hydro facilities – which themselves experienced systemic shortages in the drought of 2007 (more locally in Tasmania in 2015), and will so again in the future . Perhaps next week I will have time to post some thoughts on “root causes” of this energy crisis? I’ve also included a snapshot of last Tuesday’s MT PASA run (from 21st March) showing the 2 periods (Q1 2018 and Q1 2019) where Surplus Capacity is forecast to be negative in Victoria with the loss of the capacity of Hazelwood: As noted on the image, AEMO’s forecasting processes (including the MT PASA) are intended to elicit a market response. Hence this should not be read to imply that the lights are going to go out – however it can be taken as a leading indicator that the supply/demand balance will be tighter than (compared to other times) and hence it’s likely that prices will be higher. It’s also an open question about what type of market response will eventuate, given the root causes of the energy crisis that has arrived has also meant that the investability of new supply options that would ameliorate this deficit is more challenged than would ideally be the case. Late on Sunday, Lucille Keen posted this article at AFR noting the closures would be sequenced, with 3 units closed on Monday, another 3 units on Tuesday and the final 2 units on Wednesday. (B2) Monday 27th March 2017 Early Monday morning (07:25 NEM time) we noted that unit 8 had already tapered off and closed overnight – as shown in this image from ez2view : Unit 6 came offline a little later in the morning: The third unit down was Unit 4, which showed last production metered at 15:05 NEM time as shown in this Station Details widget within ez2view : (B3) Tuesday 28th March 2017 Early on Tuesday morning (05:50 NEM time) we see that we’re now down to only 4 units remaining – with Unit 2 having come offline overnight: As shown in the ez2view snapshot below, last generation metered at unit 7 at 09:25 NEM time on Tuesday: Late on Tuesday afternoon, we noted last legs for unit 5: (B4) Wednesday 29th March 2017 I was a little surprised to see, this morning, the remaining 2 units still running – but (at 09:15) saw Unit 3 begin winding down for the last time: Also on Wednesday I noted this article by Dylan McConnell speaking about some implications of Hazelwood closure , including the “will the lights stay on” question. This left Unit 1 as the last unit to close – which started winding down in the early afternoon: One of our guest authors on WattClarity ( Allan O’Neil ) sent me this image via social media capturing the Dispatch Interval (16:05) in which output from unit 1 dropped to zero: That’s lights out for Hazelwood … (as distinct from the broader, and way-too-politicised question about the broader Victorian region, or the whole NEM). (C) Some lessons that might be learnt In my opinion, the whole sorry saga of Hazelwood closure would offer a number of valuable lessons that we could, collectively, deploy to smooth a few bumps out of this multi-faceted energy transition . In an ideal world, I’d be confident that the relevant parties would learn from this example – however my jaundiced view is that we’re in such a polarised state (pulled by irrational extremes at both ends of the Emotion-o-Meter that this is unlikely to happen). Sad, really, given the importance. I don’t have time today to go into any detail, but would just flag these points as areas for future exploration on WattClarity when more time is available: (C1) Clarifying economic incentives for new build, and closure of old Firstly we have the whole sad tale of confused, changing and contradictory economic faced by Hazelwood (and indeed all power stations in the NEM – existing and prospective) that, evidence would suggest, is delivering perverse outcomes if the objective is indeed to deliver on all three aspects of “the energy trilemma” – security of supply, cost, and ecological sustainability. These economic incentives need to provide the right signals for both: 1) Building new capacity to supply electricity when and where it is needed. 2) Closing old, emissions-intensive capacity in the most logical sequence cognisant of system security, electricity price and emissions reduction objectives. Wishful thinking, me, for such an idealised world. Instead we have a dog’s breakfast – and have had for 10 years or so. It’s my understanding that some of the factors leading to the closure decision were referenced in my “clapped out second car” analogy a couple of years back . (C2) Working with those affected Despite the fact that the closure of Hazelwood (and Northern before it, and so on) has been telegraphed well in advance, even if the exact date has not been known, my sense is that we’ve been a little on the back foot in terms of assistance to those workers, contractors, suppliers and others affected by such a change. (C3) Looking ahead I have noted before that forecasting is a mugs game – though I understand that it is a very important role that some must play. It’s important also to note that the NEM is a market, hence participants respond to signals (albeit in great confusion at present with the muddled mess of policy we have). Couple the two together and it’s clear to me that anyone making pronouncements with extreme certainty will almost certainly end up being wrong. A key question for me, with respect to these prophets is: 1) whether they don’t understand the limitations of their view (i.e. their competence) or 2) whether they do, but talk with certainty anyway (i.e. their motivation). Which leads to the two big questions being asked: (C3a) Will the lights stay on? In truth the answer is “it depends…” It depends on how hot next summer is (and hence how high demand is). It depends on whether we experience coincident problems with generators or transmission (low probability, but it has happened in the past). It depends on what participants do with their existing capacity. It depends on what new capacity might come online before then (albeit with the limitations of wind and solar for providing firm capacity on demand). It depends on how much storage is deployed over the year, and how this is incentivised to operate. Food for another post at some stage in future. (C3b) Will prices rise? I’ve already noted before the difficulties in understanding how prices might actually turn out for some point in the future . Given we’re now sitting at the end of March (with summer behind us, and Hazelwood closed) the next “high risk” period will be Q1 2018. Hence it might be useful to consider the following chart (generated with an in-development copy of NEM-Review v7 (existing v6 clients already have early access to a BETA) ) which shows the trended prices for BASE, PEAK and CAP contracts for Q1 2018 in Victoria: It seems clear from this that “the market” (collectively) is thinking that prices are going up. Now to be clear the uplift is not all due to the Hazelwood closure (as others have noted, strengthening gas prices have also played a role – so I have also included them on the chart, though note we still have to confirm logic for calculation of an average VIC gas price for a day, given the different “gas day”). Stay tuned for more…",

    "title": "[POSTED 13:40] TC Debbie dampens electricity consumption in Queensland",
    "date": "28-03-2017 01:45:00 PM",
    "content": "You know the situation is getting serious when you see alerts like this one from the Queensland Premier on Twitter (around 12:00 on Monday 27th March): For comparison purposes, here’s a few other records we’ve provided on WattClarity over the years: January 2014 Posted here about ex TC Dylan reducing electricity demand by what seemed to be about 50MW. February 2011 I posted two articles ( here and here ) using a very early version of ez2view for the Nostalgics looking at how demand was moderated with the onset of TC Yasi . March 2006 TC Larry was the other big one in recent times, but too early for us to post anything on WattClarity. As I sat down to write this post, in between distractions, (12:30 on Tuesday 28th March) the cyclone is crossing the coast around Proserpine – so about mid-way between Mackay and Townsville. This is shown in the 12:00 update from the Bureau of Meteorology in terms of the path of the cyclone: Current news bulletins talk about the cyclone being slow moving – perhaps taking 18 hours to traverse the coastal areas (and then continuing inland as shown). (A) Effect on Electricity Consumption Given our keen interest (on WattClarity , in the ECA Consumption Widget , and in the software we provide to a diverse range of clients) in electricity consumption, it was natural that I would ask what impact it was having on electricity consumption. Now this might happen for a number of reasons – including the following 3 big ones (and one perhaps less obvious): Reason 1 = with everyone hunkered down to avoid the storm (businesses and schools shut, etc…) electricity consumption will be naturally lower Reason 2 = with temperatures lower by virtue of the storm, air-conditioning load will be reduced. Reason 3 = there, of course, is the probability that supplies will be cut to large numbers of electricity consumers as debris brings down power lines, etc… – this tweet (13:20) quotes an EnergyQLD representative talking about 38,000 customers already reported as disconnected : Reason 4 = the “demand” figure measured by the Powerlink data effectively “sees” injections from distributed solar PV as negative consumption. In the days prior to the arrival of TC Debbie I presume that there will have been some injections from small-scale solar PV in northern Queensland, but that this output will have been reduced to virtually nothing over a large area given the cloud cover. This means that, comparing “before” and “now” in the chart below, we need to remember that actual consumption in the days “before” will actually have been higher than shown, by virtue of the solar PV injections. For background, I have included a snapshot from our ez2view software that incorporates a live view of intra-regional transmission flows and zonal consumption for 11 “transmission zones” throughout Queensland, as defined by Powerlink: I’ve annotated the schematic zonal representation of the Queensland region provided therein to illustrate how the path of Cyclone Debbie is tracking between the centre of the Ross zone (i.e. Townsville) and the centre of the North zone (i.e. Mackay). Pulling out a week’s worth of historical data for the three zones in northern Queensland to produce this trend, we can see that the cyclone has dampened electricity consumption significantly in the North and Ross zones, but there does not seem to be observable dampening further north in the “Far North” zone: Summing together the reductions obvious in the North and Ross zones, it seems likely that TC Debbie has led to a demand reduction of at least 400MW , and perhaps significantly more than that because of Reason #4 above. Note that I have also highlighted some evidence of price-sensitive demand response in the Ross zone in the days leading up to the event. (B) Wind Speeds During the day we saw updates like this on social media talking about wind gusts : Given that we’re working intensively on a new version of NEM-Review (existing clients already have access to an early beta, so they can feed suggestions into the development process) I thought it might be a useful test case for looking at what was apparent. First thing I noticed was that we’ve included (in the current beta) BOM data for only Mackay, Townsville and Cairns – though I think that we have access to a broader number of measurement points in the area. It’s now logged as Job # 9523 in our internal job tracking system. Here’s what we can currently show: As can be seen, certainly higher wind speeds being recorded, but nowhere near the maximum gust speeds noted above – we’ll need to investigate why. Logged as Job #9524. (C) Consumer Safety Storms and electricity don’t mix – that’s always been the case. However with increasing penetration of distributed energy solutions (large numbers of solar PV installations, and a growing number of batteries being installed) the degree of complexity increases given that energy flows on the network can increasingly be 2-way and hence the risks of electrocution after a storm increases if correct precautions are not taken (and correct design not implemented in the first place). That’s why I was happy to see (and re- tweet ) this timely reminder from Ergon last night: It’s also why we’re working with the Australian Energy Storage Council to build a national Energy Storage Register , for reasons explained here .",

    "title": "A sudden series of SA spikes",
    "date": "23-03-2017 03:48:00 PM",
    "content": "Tuesday this week saw a short outbreak of spot price volatility in South Australia , after a few relatively quiet weeks in the physical electricity market (if not in the energy policy debate – but that’s a subject for another day!) As the chart below from ez2view ’s summary Trends widget for SA shows, there were six price spikes to levels between $3,000/MWh and $13,999/MWh (one dollar below the Market Price Cap ) between 10:30am and 1pm (NEM time, or 11am – 1:30pm Adelaide daylight saving time). After four of these spike, prices fell to or close to the Market Price Floor of –$1,000/MWh. A close look at the chart shows a small bump in scheduled demand and an equally small drop in generation availability leading into the volatility. There were no major generation events or changes in interconnector status during the volatility period itself, so what lay behind these spikes? Winding back ez2view ’s SA Schematic and Trends widgets in time travel mode to 09:00 NEM time, whilst there are no price spikes showing yet on the predispatch price forecast, we can pick up a couple of features: The Heywood Interconnector (“V-SA”, highlighted on the Schematic widget) was limited to only 50 MW of imports vs its nominal maximum capacity of 650 MW . I couldn’t find an AEMO Market Notice explicitly explaining the reason for this very low limit, but a hunt though the set of network constraints operating at the time shows that there was a significant transmission line outage on the 500kV Victorian network side of the interconnector, which is normally fed by two 500kV circuits. Previously under similar outage conditions, flows on the interconnector have been limited to about 250 MW . That previous ~250 MW limit was set at a level such that if the interconnector unexpectedly tripped due to a fault on the remaining 500kV Victorian circuit, leaving South Australia “islanded”, then supply-demand balance in South Australia could be maintained – avoiding another system black event – but only through the operation of Automated Underfrequency Load Shedding ( AUFLS ) . In the event of an interconnector trip and falling system frequency, this scheme rapidly trips enough customer load in SA – a partial blackout – to compensate for loss of imports, leaving enough time for generation in the state to then ramp up, allowing the tripped load to be restored. In this recent WattClarity article , Paul highlighted an example of how the risk of exactly this sort of outage was previously managed and communicated. It appears that in the wake of recent events, the preparedness of either the South Australian government, or AEMO, or (most likely) both, to risk further load shedding of any description is minimal, and that when there is a single-contingency risk of South Australia separating from the rest of the NEM, the limit on interconnector flows has now been reduced to a level whose loss can be managed without relying on AUFLS. Of course this restriction requires more generation to be running in South Australia than would be the case with a higher import limit and raises the risks of spot price volatility, even with demand levels as modest as they were on Tuesday – not much above half of SA’s summer maximum level. (A further side effect is the impact on the cost of extra Frequency Control Ancillary Services procured in South Australia and on that subject I’d refer you to Jonathon Dyson’s WattClarity article published today.) The second aspect highlighted on the Trends widget in the above chart is a little more subtle but it shows actual demand (the dark grey area series to the left of the vertical line representing the current Dispatch Interval) running above AEMO’s predispatch forecast demand (to the right of the line). This tends to suggest there is price risk on the upside. Finally, we can also see from the Schematic that total wind generation in the Northern and South Eastern regions of SA is relatively low at a bit under 400 MW, with most generation being gas or diesel-fired plant, principally Torrens Island, Pelican Point, Osborne and Quarantine unit 5. With Torrens Island running only three units (each of 200 MW capacity) and one Pelican Point GT out of service except under exceptional conditions , this means that most remaining “spare” generation capacity in SA was peaking plant – open-cycle gas (or diesel-fired) turbines. It’s the bidding setup of those peaking plants that drove the volatility seen over the next several hours, and I’ll focus on that issue from here. It would take far too long to do this individually, so I’ll take the “1 picture = 1000 words” approach and try to summarise events in one (complex) chart, drawing together and summarising a range of market data: Briefly, there are four panels here, showing the 5-minute SA dispatch price – notice how except for the first price spike in Dispatch Interval ( DI ) ending 10:40, the others all occur on the half hour at DIs ending 11:05, 11:35, 12:05, 12:35, and 13:05 Summarised bid bands and output (“ dispatch ”) from peaking plants (basically the various open-cycle gas turbine and liquid fuelled plant located around SA) – I’ll come back to this Total Thermal plant output and net imports Total Wind generation – it’s pretty clear that the period of price volatility coincided with a lull in wind output from above 400 MW (about 25% of installed capacity in SA), to under 200 MW The pattern of price spikes in the first 5 minutes of each half hour followed by immediate drops to low levels – negative $1,000/MWh in many cases – for the remainder of the half hour is a classic illustration of the 5/30 effect I’ve discussed several times before in this series (eg in this first piece back in January ). Under current NEM rules – which many stakeholders want to see changed, and many others do not (!) – 5-minute dispatch prices are averaged into half hourly settlement prices on which generators are actually paid, so once a high dispatch price occurs, there is a strong incentive to “pile in” with more generation for the balance of each half hour, which is exactly what we see happening here. The way that this “piling in” is achieved is by rebidding generation offers to move volume from high-price to low price bands. In the second panel above I’ve grouped the peaking plants’ bids (struck at a variety of price levels for each individual unit) into six broad bands: < $0/MWh (often offered at –$1,000/MWh) – this is where generators bid volumes they want to see dispatched almost regardless of current dispatch price $0 – $300/MWh – this range would cover marginal running (fuel) costs for most generators – interestingly none of the SA peakers had any volume bid here $300–$1,000/MWh – generally above cost, but well below maximum levels $1,000 – $10,000/MWh – surprisingly little volume offered here $10,000 – $13,900/MWh – typical range for “promoting volatility” >$13,900 (but no more than $14,000 being the Market Price Cap) – peaking generators will often “park” capacity at these maximum levels if they think they are unlikely to run, in order to avoid being called to start up for very short non-economic runs The pattern of volumes offered in each band through the period of volatility clearly shows that at the beginning of each of the “spike” half hours, the majority of this generation was offered at over $10,000/MWh, but after each spike large volumes were rebid into the <$0/MWh range, seeking to maximise dispatched volume (and switching net interconnector flows from import to export in the process). Finally, one question readers may have is whether those bid “notches” at the start of each half hour, with less volume offered at low prices and more at very high levels – which effectively drove the price spikes – were achieved via explicit rebids moving volume from low to high prices – which might look like a very obvious “gaming” strategy? The answer is largely “no”, since prior to the volatility outbreak, bids for these peakers were as follows (shown as at 10am): In other words the underlying setup of the peakers’ bids for the whole day was to have most volume offered at high prices. Looking in detail at the rebids made (eg by using ez2view ’s Bids and Offers tool) it turns out that most of the relevant rebids moved volumes around for the current half hour settlement period, and left the distribution of volumes for future settlement periods unchanged until and unless there was a five minute price spike prompting a “dive for volume”. This would be a fairly normal bid setup for such plant on a moderate demand day, the difference on Tuesday being that tight import restrictions due the Victorian transmission outage and possibly the lull in wind generation came together to promote the chance of volatile prices.

    "title": "NEM FCAS causer pays factor issues for wind and solar farms",
    "date": "23-03-2017 11:35:00 AM",
    "content": "Generators used to consider the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) FCAS causers pays factors (CPF), used to allocate FCAS regulation costs across the market, as an obscure and unimportant technically challenging curiosity. Since 2014, the cost of FCAS regulation services for generators has increased from just under $5 million per year to greater than $60 million for 2016 and now has the attention of all of the generators, especially if their portfolio includes generation assets in regions with a lack of FCAS regulation providers and high prices such as South Australia. This article will attempt to simply explain how FCAS causer pays factors are calculated and the issues that arise from the present AEMO formulation, especially for wind and solar farms. Background and Intent of Regulation Services The way that CPFs are presently calculated was formulated when the FCAS markets for raise, lower and regulation services were introduced into the NEM as an interim solution that has been largely unchanged since its inception in 2001 before there were any wind or solar farms operating in the market. For a dispatched generator, such as coal, gas or hydro plant, the CPF formulation measures how much each dispatched unit in the NEM varied from the dispatch target that AEMO determined from the dispatch process, by calculating the difference between a unit’s generation and a straight line drawn between two successive dispatch targets (TOTALCLEARED values) every 4 seconds and averaged over the 5 min dispatch interval [AEMO 2] . The reasoning behind calculating a CPF based on deviations is that a unit should generate to the dispatch target determined by the AEMO dispatch process and any deviation from that target must be made up by FCAS regulation services, hence the “causer pays” part of the CPF moniker. Figure 1 – 4 second causer pays deviations example Each of the 4 second deviations are multiplied by an FI factor that is calculated by summing all of enabled levels of FCAS regulation for all units supplying FCAS regulation for either the mainland or Tasmanian regions. The sign of the FI factor and the sign of the deviation means that if the 4 second FI factor is positive when other units are supplying raise services and the generator has a positive 4 second deviation then the CPF will be positive as the unit’s generation is assisting to stabilize the system frequency. Conversely if the FI factor and the deviation are opposite signs then the CPF is negative as the unit is contributing to the system instability and contributing to the requirement for more FCAS regulation services. Therefore negative CPFs are bad for a generator and ensure that the generator will receive a greater allocation of FCAS regulation costs and positive CPFs are good for the generator. These 5 minute factors are then averaged again over a 28 day period and then summed up for each participant’s portfolio, producing an overall factor that represents a participant’s relative share of the FCAS regulation costs to be distributed over the NEM. As a portfolio may have a mix of positive and negative CPFs, overall these can net out over a participant’s generation portfolio. The 28 day participant CPF is then used for later settlement weeks, so that the FCAS regulation costs allocated to a generator this settlement week, are based upon that generator’s portfolio performance for a 28 day period before this week started. CPF Formulation issues for wind and solar farms When wind, and later solar, farms were introduced into the NEM, a new type of generator class called semi-dispatched units was created where a semi-dispatched generator was free to generate as much energy as available from the wind or solar resource, with the additional requirement that AEMO can limit a unit’s generation if there are constraints in the system or that unit’s energy is priced higher than the current regional price. For the CPF formulation for semi-dispatched generators, the words “dispatch target” was simply replaced by a new term “dispatch level” and effectively the same formulation was used as for the dispatched generators, even though semi-dispatched generators are not required to generate to a target. However when the wind or solar farm is operating with a semi-dispatch cap flag set, the semi-dispatched generator is required to generate at or below the value of the semi-dispatch cap. The fact that semi-dispatched wind and solar farms do not have to match these “dispatch levels” as they are not targets means that semi-dispatched generators are being evaluated against a standard that they are not required to meet, except when a semi-dispatch cap is present and then it is a one way target and most wind and solar farms do not get a lot of semi-dispatch caps. Even worse news for semi-dispatched generators is that these “dispatch levels” are calculated by AEMO forecasting systems called AWEFS for wind farms and ASEFS for solar farms that were never designed to produce forecasts of wind or solar generation for the next 5 minute dispatch period but rather were designed for longer term forecasts for the next day or day and a half. Gross forecasting errors result in the generation of very large outlier CPFs that seem to be a feature of wind and solar farm CPF distributions (see Figure 4 later) and are exacerbated by the use of averaging the 5 minute CPFs over the 28 day period. Averages of averages do not in fact produce an overall average of any quantity, a fact that is easily proved mathematically, and so it is not clear what this averaging of the 5 minute averages is attempting to achieve. No justification for the use of averaging is provided in the AEMO formulation [AEMO 2] other than it is the most common method of representing a sample. Average aggregations will be significantly influenced by the presence of large 5 minute CPF outliers and lead to unrepresentative CPF values and hence have a significant influence on the size of aggregate causer pays factors. Medians are a standard economic aggregation used when it is important to represent a sample and not be inappropriately influenced by outliers, such as the standard reporting of median wages or house prices that would otherwise produce nonsensical mean values due to no upper bound on a small number of observations. Calculating CPF factors using a median approach would therefore produce a CPF factor that is not unduly influenced by outliers and would provide a more meaningful representation of the CPF sample. Figure 2 – Improvement in raw CPF using a median calculation As can be seen in Figure 2, using a median aggregation of 5 minute causer pays factors has led to substantial improvements in the unit CPFs for the wind and solar farms for the selected market units that can be directly attributed to the insensitivity of the CPF to 5 minute CPF outliers. Poor forecasting leads to large negative CPFs AEMO needs to forecast the generation from wind and solar farms so that expected levels of generation can be used as an input to the AEMO dispatch process and so that other generators can be dispatched at levels that meet the system forecast demand on a 5 minute dispatch interval basis. The AEMO forecasting systems use as the input to the forecasting system for a particular generator, the number of available generating inputs, measurement of wind or solar resource and the current level of generation. Unfortunately for many generators, single inputs of the wind or solar resource are not very representative of the performance of a large wind or solar farm spread over a large area or where there are geographical variations resulting in vastly different levels of wind or solar resource across the entire farm. Figure 3 – Large wind farm wind speed range with AWEFS input wind speed For this example of a large wind farm shown in figure 3, it can be seen that there is a very large variation of wind speeds across all of the turbines and the single wind speed measurement used as the input to AWEFS shown in the middle of the wind speed range is hardly representative of the entire wind farm and does in fact lead to very poor forecasts of wind farm generation. Also the calculation of the CPFs use the last and current TOTALCLEARED values that for wind and solar farms are the forecast generation, and there is no correction of these values to recorded actual generation. This means that if the forecast generation is significantly wrong for a reasonable period of time, such as predicting generation when the farm is actually not producing any power or when constrained by the distribution system, the CPFs are very large, wrong and they stay wrong. Poor generation forecasts inevitably lead to large CPF factors and contribute to wind and solar farms getting very poor CPFs in comparison to other generation technologies and therefore wind and solar farms are paying a disportionate proportion of the market FCAS regulation costs. There is a consistent bias in the observed amounts of raise regulation services in the market and also an observed over estimation of wind and solar generation from the AWEFS and ASEFS forecasting systems that results in very large negative (ie. bad) CPFs. Figure 4 – Distribution of raw CP factor vs generation Figure 4 shows the distribution of raw CPFs for a range of different generation technologies and it can be easily seen that wind (BALDHWF1, MACARTH1) and solar (NYNGAN1) farms have a large spread of very large CPFs with the presence of extreme outliers compared to coal (LOYYB1, GSTONE1) and hydro (MURRAY) units and at much lower levels of generation. It can also be seen that the CPF distributions for wind and solar farms are asymmetric and biased towards large and hence bad CPFs. To get an indication of the influence of the AWEFS generation forecasts on the CPFs for wind and solar farms, CPFs were recalculated for a selection of wind and solar farms where the final TOTALCLEARED target was simply replaced by the level of generation at the start of the previous 5 minute dispatch interval. Using the previous INITIALMW generation value as the forecast for the current dispatch interval is a very crude method of state forecasting that can be vastly improved by a more sophisticated form of short term forecasting but as can be seen in the following graph (Figure 5) resulted in a dramatic improvement to the wind and solar farm CPFs. Figure 5 – Change in raw FCAS unit CPFs using INITIALMW as final target Additional research was conducted into other parts of the CPF calculation such as determining the significance of time lags in the SCADA measurements used in the calculations, the use of different profiles to a linear profile between dispatch levels and other forecasting approaches and the impact of the AEMO forecasting errors was clearly the most important factor in reducing CPFs for wind and solar farms. A very important outcome from the recent AEMO ECM Consultation process [AEMO 1] is that wind and solar farms will be able to provide AEMO with an internally calculated forecast of 5 minute generation and this initiative received strong industry support. Generator “Estimated Power” forecasts would provide a very effective means for wind and solar farms to substantially reduce their excessive proportion of the cost recovery of NEM FCAS regulation services. Summary Wind and solar farms have been unreasonably allocated a disproportionately large part of the NEM FCAS generator regulation service costs that have increased from $5 million to $60 million over the last three years. Simply adapting the dispatched generator CPF formulation for wind and solar farms was inappropriate and ill-considered considering the different dispatch requirements and targets for dispatched versus semi-dispatched generators. Poor AWEFS and ASEFS forecasts have produced large generation deviations and extreme outlier CPF values that unduly influence the unit CPF by the use of averaging rather than a more appropriate sample representation such as the use of median aggregation. Implementation of the “Estimated Power” forecast for wind and solar farms is urgently required to address the serious shortcomings of the present AEMO AWEFS and ASEFS systems that are causing excessive financial losses to wind farms who are being charged a disproportionate allocation of the FCAS regulation costs and to help to improve system stability.

    "title": "Fast Frequency Service – Treating the symptom not the cause?",
    "date": "23-03-2017 10:58:00 AM",
    "content": "The National Electricity Market ( NEM ) is designed to operate at 50 Hz. Frequency deviation occurs when generation and load are mismatched. It is important in a lightly meshed and long network such as the NEM to maintain tight frequency control and that frequency response is available throughout the network. Changes in the approach to frequency control on the synchronous units has resulted in technical and regulatory changes which have compromised the resilience of the power system to frequency variations. Consequently, an accumulation of small contingency events (as on 28 September 2016) can leave the power system exposed. Prior to 1999 frequency deviation was addressed by mandated governor controls on the synchronous generating units. The governors operated to control frequency deviations larger than 0.1 Hz around 50Hz. The governors provided a continuous control of frequency as they commenced acting within the normal operating band when frequency deviated by 0.05Hz from 50 Hz (rather than commencing only when the operating band was exceeded). This form of primary control, that provides fast response to frequency deviation, is mandated in other countries. In 1999 the regulatory arrangements for the NEM were redesigned to create a real time market for the provision of all of its frequency control. The changes introduced in 2001 included: redefining the normal operating band from 49.9 Hz to 50.1 Hz to 49.85 Hz to 50.15 Hz introducing eight frequency control ancillary services ( FCAS ) which operate in distinct bands. Subsequent changes in the regulatory framework discourage tight governor control by: attributing poor causer pays factors to synchronous generators with tight deadbands that are contributing to good frequency control penalising generating units which ramp in a non-linear fashion because they are providing a primary governor response to frequency deviations within the normal operating band . Over time, as a consequence of these changes and disincentives, governor deadband have been widened from 0.1Hz to 0.3Hz or more and units can disable their governors when not economically dispatched to provide frequency control. This has resulted in a significant deterioration to the fast frequency response of the power system. In contrast to the original efficient control action of governors, the FCAS services are inefficient because the action starts later requiring more service to control frequency and may not be located where it is required. Due to the switching between services, the control is not optimal and does not provide good primary control of frequency. For example, frequency needs to fall to below 49.85 Hz before contingency FCAS is provided to contribute to arresting the fall in frequency. Fast primary control response to frequency deviation within a narrow deadband ensures that frequency deviations are effectively and continuously addressed. By delaying the response to a fall in frequency synchronous generating unit momentum is lost because its rotating energy is extracted into electrical energy – this is the “inertial contribution” and deceleration sets in, therefore, frequency drops lower and will require more energy to recover. An analogy to this is a truck has to accelerate in order to maintain its speed as it goes up a hill. It must accelerate (or increase its energy input) early enough to maintain its momentum. Failure to accelerate earlier enough will result in the truck slowing down. It cannot easily regain its original speed and can only gear down and crawl up the hill or worse stall. The resilience of the power system has been compromised by the shift to market based frequency control on the synchronous generating units. The deterioration of fast acting governor control represents a significant deviation from Good Electricity Industry Practice and fails to meet the National Electricity Objective as more services are required to be dispatched than if services were re-designed with narrow deadbands. Current proposals for improved frequency response remain focused on market mechanisms. Implementing another market for fast frequency response will result in the same issues described above unless the market and the regulations reconsider how to incorporate good frequency control into the normal operating band. The type of frequency control required cannot be centrally dispatched – it must be in continuous operation in the control systems – central dispatch responds too slowly to be effective. Reassessment of the approach to frequency control should be undertaken with a view to: reintroducing narrow mandated deadbands across the NEM removing regulatory disincentives to tight governor action. Further details and supporting data are set out in the accompanying paper published 3 Feb 2017. On 10 th February 2017 hot weather placed the NSW region at risk, the AEMO report on the event noted that (after a number of other heat related issues occurring in the region) at 16:22 a Tallawarra unit tripped from 408MW, this reduced the frequency to below 49.85Hz and for the following 7 minutes there was a sustained frequency oscillation on power system with a 24 second period. Analysis of the 4 second data illustrates why there is an immediate primary control issue with the synchronous units on the power system. The control (or lack of control) of the synchronous ‘baseload’ generation units are the cause of the instability of the frequency control on the power system.

    "title": "Let’s talk about FCAS",
    "date": "23-03-2017 10:29:00 AM",
    "content": "Ancillary Services Matter! No longer just realm of electrical engineer or energy trading boffins, ancillary services (and particularly Frequency Control Ancillary Services or FCAS which will concentrate on today) have become front and centre in so many ways that barely a day goes by without market observers referring to grid stability, inertia or frequency management. FCAS has always (and will continue to be), a vital component of any large power system. In the past, few would understand the inner workings of FCAS and most traders would not give it the time of day because the prices were very low and the impact marginal – they were effectively provided for free. Today, that is far from the case, with boardrooms across the country from energy utilities and major consumers, through to politicians and media outlets, discussing something that has always been there, but rarely seen or understood. So, in conjunction with a presentation at the CEC Wind Industry Forum, where FCAS formed a central element of the day, I thought I would take a deeper look into and explain a few of the pieces that form the FCAS puzzle. What is FCAS? FCAS is a NEM-specific name applied to a group of services that help maintain our power system at 50Hz. As demand for electricity changes continuously across the power system, the generation (from whichever source!) is adjusted to keep these two items matched. Too much demand without enough generation, and the frequency will fall. Too much generation for the given demand and frequency will rise. If the frequency falls outside the 47-52Hz range, the power system will begin to collapse to protect the equipment and we will have blackouts as occurred in South Australia in September 2016. One of AEMO’s primary responsibilities is to manage the power system and market such that these types of events are avoided. My friends at Global Roam help put this GIF together to show the continual movement and change that occurs between generation, demand and frequency (this GIF is for illustrative purposes only). In order for generation to be in a position to continually adjust its output, the FCAS markets were created to send a price signal for the value of those services in conjunction with the corresponding energy price. The FCAS markets comprise of two distinct types of services; regulation and contingency. Contingency (or system stabilisation as they are known elsewhere) services are locally enabled at the plant equipment level and will respond to the frequency without a central command or instruction. The FCAS Contingency services are broken down into raise and lower components across a fast (6 second), slow (60 second) and Delayed (5 minute) time frame – 6 distinct service requirements and market prices for each region. You will also hear discussion at the moment around very fast frequency response (or FFR) capability which AEMO is considering as part of its Future Power System Security work . A crucial element here is that the Raise services are paid for by generators in the NEM, whereas customers/loads pay for Lower services. The other frequency service is Regulation (or load matching), which are again broken into raise and lower elements for each region. Unlike contingency services that are locally enabled/installed on sites, regulation services are managed by an AEMO signal that is updating every 4 seconds via the Automatic Generation Control (AGC) control system. As the power system moves between 49.85Hz and 50.15Hz (the Normal Operating Frequency Band ), a small adjustment of up or down (raise or lower) is sent from AEMO to enabled generators (and loads) to alter their output, thereby keeping the frequency at 50Hz. An important element of the regulation services is the concept of Causer Pays Payment Recovery, which is dealt with in Harley’s post . All the regulation and contingency services come together continuously to act to keep frequency at 50Hz: 24 hours a day, 7 days a week all year round. This is represented in the below image which shows how the numerous services work together to bring frequency back to 50Hz following an event (I have chosen to use indicative charts here instead of real event data just to avoid those ‘finger-pointing’ exercises that have dominated recent discussions on this topic). Are renewables killing the grid and making it unstable? No. Yes wind and solar are intermittent generation sources and their generation continually changes, but as anyone who has kept an eye on Watt Clarity over the years will have noticed, the generation on the grid is changing all the time and is designed to handle changes. As Allan O’Neil noted recently about the 3 rd March , a plant failure in the Torrens Island switchyard in South Australia caused nearly 600MW to trip on protection settings in less than a second; I’m not aware of too many wind farms in the NEM that decrease output like that all the time! I bring this up to highlight that as the grid changes, the need to manage the operating envelope will change, which in turn will change the market pricing of the FCAS (and energy) within the technical boundary. I hear lots of people talk about how wind and solar generation sources do not provide ancillary services. Actually, this is not isolated to wind and solar generation as many gas-fired plant do not provide FCAS either because the commercial economics in recent times did not warrant it. After several high FCAS-pricing events in South Australia in late 2015, both Quarantine 5 and Osbourne power stations installed and commissioned the necessary equipment in 2016 to provide regulation services: the market signal worked. Similarly, as was recently announced by ESCOSA , AEMO, ARENA, ESCOSA and Neoen will come together to conduct a trial at Hornsdale 2 wind farm to provide FCAS, and I have little doubt there will be more announcements to come in this space. Other places around the world are using wind farms (and increasingly solar plant too) to provide FCAS. A couple of sites I highlighted in the CEC forum include: Within the PSCO balancing authority area in the MidISO grid in the US, where wind penetration at times is up to 60% (in a 7000MW system), over 2000MW was enabled for regulation services by Dec 2015 (see Figure 3). You will note the ‘Park Potential’ label, a concept that is currently being discussed in the NEM as ‘Estimated Power’ as part of improvements to the Australian Wind Energy Forecasting System (AWEFS). In the North Island of NZ, the Te Uku plant is capable of providing contingency services in response to frequency step-changes (see Figure 4) The above two examples are only a few of the many places around the world where FCAS services are provided by a variety of different plant types. Therefore, I think we can stop the rhetoric that renewable sources cannot do it – they (and many other plant in the NEM) are not providing some of these services because it did not make economic sense to do so! As always, it is rarely a case of technical feasibility but rather one of business value. Recent Market Events There are far too many recent FCAS market events that I will save that over to another post, which will be centred on FCAS Co-optimisation and how the FCAS and energy markets interact in each 5-minute dispatch interval. However, I thought it worth pointing out how the business value for FCAS providers of the future might look given current market outcomes. Looking back a few days to Tuesday 21 March 2017 in SA, with the energy price at -$1000/MWh for large periods throughout the day, and the FCAS Raise Regulation and FCAS Lower Regulation price near $10,000/MWh for large periods of the afternoon, an FCAS provider would be optimising their portfolio well by ensuring they were fully enabled in the FCAS Regulation markets, even if that meant reducing their output in the energy market. The pricing signal for FCAS is well and truly among us! Wrapping it up … So some key points on FCAS: FCAS has always been around, and always will be; Ancillary Services matter! The power grid is a dynamic system with generation and load changing all the time; frequency is the measure of how in balance the system is! Wind (and Solar) plants can and do provide ancillary services and will undoubtedly be enabled within the NEM in the near future, as long as the commercial value is suitable to the service provider About our Guest Author Jonathon has 18 years practical experience in the Australian NEM, having held senior operational and trading roles in participant organisations and now as the Director of a specialist market consulting organisation, with a specific focus on renewable energy integration.

    "title": "On batteries, and “fixing South Australia’s problems”",
    "date": "16-03-2017 06:49:00 AM",
    "content": "Elon Musk, in a social-media triggered marketing coup that would make Richard Branson proud, certainly caused a stir last week with his announcement about saving South Australia from all it’s power woes last week. I posted a quick note about it over here on our battery-focused project site last week – and have continued to think through the implications of what it might actually mean. (A) Which problem (of many) are we focused on solving? Late last week, the headlines like these in the two main newspapers of substance in the country ( Ben Potter in the AFR on the 9th and Chris Griffith in the Australian on the 10th ) indicate that the journalists at least inferred Tesla was promising to solve South Australia’s problems, and (given the 2 very similar headings) would seem to indicate that Tesla had actually promised this : Over the week that’s followed the initial billionaire banter on twitter , I have seen many dive in to comment about the viability (or not) of batteries for solving “the problem” – however for me I am still uncertain as to what it is that Tesla is promising * to solve . * Accepting the near impossibility of any form of pay-for-performance in an electricity sector/market that’s as interconnected as our national grid/market , any such “promised resolution” by a Tech Company (remembering that we’re one, too) ultimately means, in the fine print, an offer to deliver a certain piece of kit – that may, on a rainy/sunny/other day, help with the aforementioned problem. I thought it might be useful to identify that there are a number of problems that have beset South Australia over the past year or so – and that these were already annotated on the trended price chart from my post earlier in the week . In table form, I’ve listed some of them : Problem #1 Two-speed prices In July 2016 I posted this analysis of some remarkable pricing patterns we’d observed occurring through Q2. Readers should note that this pattern has emerged pretty much NEM-wide, and is occurring for a number of different (coincident) reasons, including the changing nature of the generation mix. Note that this is a systemic change across the NEM that poses massive challenges to established norms in so many different ways. Below I include some quick thoughts about how 100MW of storage would “solve” this particular challenge/problem/opportunity. Problem #2 Increased incidence of high-high prices As noted in the chart posted here this week, there have been periods of extreme volatility experienced in South Australia – most notably Q3 2016. Both this, and the two-speed pricing pattern, has driven the forward price curve through the roof – threatening business viability of many large energy users. Problem #3 Blackout of 28th September 2016 There was the SA state-wide blackout on 28th September 2016 . It’s not clear whether this was the “problem” that Tesla is pitching its batteries as the solution for. As anyone who’s followed the energy debate in the past 6 months will know, there were a combination of reasons why this blackout occurred – and it seems there is still more investigation to be done, there. AEMO’s 3rd interim report here highlights a number of contributing factors – but a final report has not yet been produced. Nor has there been any major independent review performed (I’m thinking here of the NOUS Report produced after a similarly large blackout affecting 1,000MWs of load in Victoria after bushfires of January 2007). Perhaps this is part of the remit of the Finkel review – however I understand that Finkel believes his mandate not sufficiently broad to tally up the total cost of the blackout, for instance . Problem #4 SA islanding and load shedding on 1st December 2016 I posted this quick analysis of the transmission disruption (and load shedding I was unaware of at the time) on 1st December 2016 . Here’s AEMO’s Final report on this SA separation event . Problem #5 Tight supply demand and load shedding on 8th February 2017. I posted this quick article late on the day of the load shedding . Allan posted this next-day analysis , and followed up with more about Pelican Point . In this particular case, AEMO did instruct 100MW of local load shedding to maintain system security : (a) It seems likely, therefore, that it was this specific problem that Tesla was targeting with its “100MW of batteries” number . (b) In simple terms, the thinking seems to have been that, if we had 100MW of batteries, we could have asked them to discharge as an alternative to load shedding. The other key metric, in this case, is that the intervention lasted from 18:03 to 18:30 NEM time (AEST). Hence 27 minutes – equating to about 45MWh of load shed. Here’s AEMO’s System Event Report for the machinations of 8th February 2017 . Problem #6 Near miss occurrence on 3rd March 2017. Our guest author, Allan O’Neil, posted this analysis of what went on during that Friday , and how lucky SA was that the lights did not go out there. I have not seen any report on this instance yet from AEMO, thought they did issue this Media Statement on the day. ————— [UPDATE] two of our savvy readers have pointed out this AEMO report was posted on 10th March . The main take-away here is that there are these 6 discrete problems that I can easily identify as relevant to South Australia – all of which have occurred over the past 12 months. There are more we could list if time permitted – but I’m sure you get the point. I’m sure that Tesla did not mean to imply that all of these would be fixed by its 100MW battery offer, but an uninformed reader (who would also equate to a voter in SA’s next elections – but also, potentially, a private Tesla customer as well) may well be led to believe that Tesla is promising to solve all of the above woes. (B) Was the offer 100MW or was it 100MWh? If we leave aside, for the moment, the “problem solving” question, I was also initially pretty uncertain about what is actually being promised to deliver, technically – and I’d put that down to the common confusion amongst the broader stakeholder group about the difference between a Watt (W), and a Watt-hour (Wh). My sense, having dealt with this over many years (including with well more than half the software engineers who have ever come to work with us) is that the choice of unit unfortunately delivers a share of the confusion: (i) People generally understand that km/h and L/s are both rates over time, and also would understand that J/s is a rate – however we chose to confuse things by choosing the Watt as the unit for rate in the power sector. (ii) People also generally understand that a Meter, a Gram and a Litre are all measurements of some form of quantity – in the same way that they would more easily understand that a Joule is a measure of quantity – but, because we have included a unit of time in the “MWh”, people get all confused and hence sometimes label this “MW/h” The exchange between Elon Musk and Mike Cannon-Brooks (copied again below) was framed around 100MW, but there was also plenty of chatter about 100MWh – and (as noted above) each are very different concepts: A 1MW battery will not be the same physical item as a 1MWh battery. My understanding of the Tesla technology is that, no matter what the size, the same underlying components are used – and essentially just stacked together to make something bigger. Hence I have referenced the specification sheets for both the old Tesla Powerwall 1 and new Tesla Powerwall 2 from our Battery Finder™ widget as shown below: Here’s the details page from our Battery Finder™ for the Tesla Powerwall 1 Here’s the details page from our Battery Finder ™ for the (AC) Tesla Powerwall 2 The key metrics are summed up here: Tesla Powerwall 1 Tesla Powerwall 2 (AC) Nominal Capacity 6.4 kWh (a quantity) 13.2kWh (a quantity) Nominal Output Power 3.3 kW (a rate of discharge) 5 kW (a rate of discharge) … therefore, to produce this 100MW battery bank, would need … 30,304 units 20,000 units … which would deliver… 194MWh of storage from 100% to 0% discharge (a quantity) 264MWh of storage from 100% to 0% discharge (a quantity) As can be seen, either option (old model, or new) would have had sufficient capacity to discharge the 45MWh required by AEMO in Problem #5 – assuming they had a reasonable level of charge prior to the event. … however let’s delve into more detail below… (C) With this hypothetical 100MW of battery storage, how would it address each problem? I had intended to walk through each of the 6 discrete problems above, to identify how 100MW of battery storage would have addressed each of these – however I’m running out of available hours today, so am only able to add quick thoughts: (C1) Addressing Problem #1 (two-speed prices) with 100MW of battery storage The two speed pricing problem arises because of a number of factors – but a key factor in the mix is the intermittency of wind (in the South Australian case). This “yin and yang of wind” animation , using NEM-watch , helps to illustrate this for those who are unaware. What the oft-quoted “Merit Order Effect” gives on the one hand (in terms of suppressing prices when the wind blows) it takes away on the other (in terms of contributing to closure decisions on volume-starved thermal capacity, which might otherwise have helped to keep prices down in the non-windy periods). The jump in gas prices and closure of Northern has made the gap between the “high” step and the “low” step much greater. Unfortunately, the volume of energy, and number of hours involved, suggest that 100MW of storage would be just a drop in the bucket compared to the quantum of storage that would be needed to effectively address this growing (and significant) challenge. This challenge is what this particular back-of-the-envelope exercise was focused on in 2015 – and I followed up with more detailed analysis here for a hypothetical “10x scenario” later in 2015. From last year’s analysis of Q2 2016 I have lifted the following chart: A key number, here is that in Q2 2016 there were at last 1,000 half-hours where the trading price was above $100/MWh. Because of the nature of the generation mix at these times (typically there is 1,000MW of wind missing from the actual mix – hence much reduced competition) I have significant doubts that 100MW of storage would make much difference to price outcomes. Effectively it would require to be 10x as large (back-of-the-envelope) to “replace” the missing wind and, because of the pattern of wind variability and battery round-trip efficiency, would require at least as much wind generation again to be installed as a charging source when windy. Not a fast solution, and not one the SA government could easily fund I suspect. (C2) Addressing Problem #2 (more high-high prices) with 100MW of battery storage In terms of the higher prices, we see in the chart above (for Q2 2016) a much lower incidence of prices above $300/MWh – and, though the incidence will have been higher for Q3 2016, will still have been an order of magnitude or more lower. Far more likely, I think, that 100MW of storage might have some effect here in knocking off some (but not all) of the extreme peaks in price. (C3) Addressing Problem #3 (the blackout of 28th September) with 100MW of battery storage Would 100MW of battery storage have helped here when multiple cascading failures led to a state-wide blackout? Without going into detail on the sequence of events it seems unlikely that 100MW of battery storage (or “just” 100MW of anything) would have made much difference, in the end. (C4) Addressing Problem #4 (islanding on 1st December) with 100MW of battery storage No time to think through this at all. (C5) Addressing Problem #5 (load shedding on 8th February) with 100MW of battery storage As noted above, it does appear that this was the specific “problem” identified by Tesla that this particular solution would solve – as 100MW of load shedding was called for. In this case, it seems that 100MW of storage would deliver the solution required . It’s a separate issue that 300-400MW of load shedding was delivered (as we noted in our article on the day) – but I’m not sure an analyst would credit these hypothetical batteries for “saving” this additional accidental load shedding in a hypothetical future case. (C6) Addressing Problem #6 (near miss on 3rd March) with 100MW of battery storage No time to analyse this in any detail at all. Two conclusions, here, are that 100MW of batteries would probably have helped with Problem #5 – but that the imprecise and nebulous wording of the “promise to cure SA of its woes” (whether deliberate marketing, or innocent mistake) seems likely to add to fuel to the fire of customer scepticism about the energy sector in more general terms (i.e. seen/inferred to make promises it can’t deliver on), and hence continue the reduction in our collective social licence to operate . Not a position any of us really want to be in, I would think? (D) We’ll be at Queensland Energy Storage Summit on Wednesday next week, 22nd March (and want to speak with you) Finally, I’d just like to note that we’ll be speaking at the Queensland Energy Storage Summit on Wednesday next week in Brisbane – about the Energy Storage Register project we’re collaborating on, and how this is spinning off other items of value to the industry – like the Battery Finder™ widget utilised above. We’re looking to add to our team keen volunteers/collaborators to continue to push this project forward so would ask that you catch us at this event if you are keen, and fit into either of the following two categories: 1) You’re involved in the storage sector in some way such that you could contribute data to the Energy Storage Register; and 2) You don’t have data yourself, but would find value in being able to access and utilise the data we’re collecting in the register, understanding that it is subject to Privacy Restrictions . If you miss us there, could I suggest that you do any or all of the above: Action 1 = check out the growing volume of information we are publishing on the specially-focused site www.BatteryStorage.info Action 2 = give us a call on (+61 7 3368 4064), or email us at storagedatabase@global-roam.com Action 3 = catch us at another event late in the year in your own location (for instance, we’ll probably also be at this solar and storage conference on 3rd and 4th May in Melbourne ).",

    "title": "Where is the east coast domgas development boom?",
    "date": "07-03-2017 02:56:00 PM",
    "content": "When markets operate normally, a sharp rise in the price of any commodity triggers a boom in exploration, development and new supply. The resource boom at the start of this century, underpinned by rapid expansion of Australia’s iron ore and LNG industries, is a textbook example. So where is the boom in domestic gas development and supply in response to a doubling of prices over the past year? On the east coast, spot prices on the Brisbane Short Term Trading Market (STTM) more than doubled from an average of $3.13 per gigajoule (GJ) in Q4 2015 to an average of $7.36/GJ in Q4 2016, and have since climbed sharply higher to $10/GJ or more. Spot prices in Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne have also risen spectacularly over the past year. Average east coast contract prices are twice historical levels and rising sharply as contracts roll over in a new environment of very tight supply. Despite booming prices you can count the number of new projects on the fingers of one hand: Kipper (Gippsland Basin Joint Venture), Cooper Energy’s Sole project, the Northern Gas Pipeline operated by Jemena and the Senex Western Surat Project. Between them these projects will at best be able to offset decline from mature fields rather than providing significant new supply. Not only is there little new development, existing producers are selling gas-producing assets. Santos has sold its offshore Victorian acreage to Cooper Energy. After unsuccessfully trying to sell its Cooper Basin interest separately, Origin Energy has wrapped it into its New Co IPO package. So what is the problem? Factor 1 = Slump in Oil Prices There are a number of causes but the slump in oil prices in November 2014 is a major one. Most oil and gas companies produce oil as well as gas. A halving of oil prices cuts heavily into their cash flow available for exploration and development. Oil companies around the world have been slashing capital spending on both oil and gas. Australia’s new LNG producers were hit hard because the price of LNG from their new projects is linked to oil prices. Locally, Santos and Origin Energy had just completed development of their billion-dollar LNG projects and were carrying particularly heavy debt burdens at the time of the slump. The fall in the oil price has also taken the shine off potential new gas plays such as unconventional Cooper Basin gas. Companies are having to be more risk-averse and cannot afford to invest too much in longer term opportunities. Factor 2 = High Development Costs Costs are another factor. While gas prices are high, costs have also increased. Some costs are coming down, such as drilling costs. However in the absence of new discoveries companies are developing more marginal fields that require more wells but produce less gas per well. Drilling for gas is a risky business and as fields mature the geology gets more difficult and costs rise. This is evident offshore Victoria, in the Cooper Basin and in Queensland. Offshore, gas explorers still have opportunities to make big discoveries that could transform the supply-demand balance on the east coast, but the 2014 collapse in oil prices has all but wiped out the appetite for high-risk offshore exploration drilling. And even if there was a major greenfield discovery tomorrow, it would take at least five years to bring the gas to market, and possibly closer to a decade. Factor 3 = Moratoriums or Bans Another factor is the restrictions on development in NSW and onshore Victoria. The Santos’ Narrabri gas project, based on coal seam gas resources in northwest NSW has the potential to supply up to 50% of NSW’s gas needs, but has been bogged down for several years due to a state moratorium on coal seam gas development and environmental protests. And therein lies another major reasons for the failure of investment in new gas projects. Onshore, conventional reserves in the Cooper Basin, which has been the mainstay of gas supply to SA and NSW for decades, are quickly depleting. Unconventional gas is the great hope for new gas discoveries, but exploration and development is now permanently banned in Victoria. In NSW, the state government is watering down its opposition, but the damage has already been done. NSW in particular has over 2,000 petajoules of gas that was intended for development but is now effectively locked up. In Victoria the restrictions on drilling mean that it is impossible to tell how much gas is locked away but studies by Geoscience Australia suggest that it could be trillions of cubic feet. If we cannot drill, we will never know. Factor 4 = Confusion, or Misinformation Government restrictions on exploration access are only part of the problem. Equal responsibility can be sheeted home to environmental groups that have no interest in facts if they get in the way of their objective of closing down the fossil fuel industry. For example, Beach Energy ran into protests from anti-fracking groups in the southeast of South Australia even though it was drilling conventional wells in the Otway Basin. Drilling in the region is now a political football after the state opposition promised a moratorium on fracking. Gas explorers are now steering clear of any kind of exploration in southeast, given what happened over the border in Victoria. Factor 5 = Political/Sovereign Risk Any company considering investment in the east coast faces these kinds of political risks. Will an investment become a political football or be targeted by activists. What will happen to renewable energy targets? Also will state governments intensify or roll-back their drilling restrictions? Will the federal government make major changes to PRRT, as is currently being considered? Will a domestic gas reservation policy be implemented? Factor 6 = Market Concentration – Supply-Side, and Demand-Side There are also commercial risks. The two biggest gas producers on the east coast now are Shell and the ExxonMobil/BHP Billiton Gippsland Joint Venture. Any investor has to consider the likely future moves of these two players. The buying side is also dominated by a small number of big players: AGL, Origin Energy and Energy Australia. Any investor in new gas development will need offtake contracts from one or more of these buyers. Selling gas into the short-term trading markets is too risky. These markets are small and illiquid. Another risk an investor has to consider is the possibility of LNG imports, which has the potential to transform the balance of supply and demand. Factor 7 = Market Transparency Another impediment to investment is the general lack of transparency of the Australian upstream gas market. Any overseas investor is likely to have great difficulty getting the most basic information about reserves, production and drilling results. An executive in a US oil and gas company without interests in Australia recently made the comment: Australia is not a very data transparent country. It’s not as bad as Malaysia but light-years away from Norway, which has excellent transparency. Thailand is much more transparent than Australia. I suspect that Australia does not view transparency as being in the national interest. If better information helps attract additional investment it is indeed in the national interest. The worst offender in this regard is the Commonwealth Government, which has jurisdiction over offshore waters beyond the three-mile limit but information on activities in Commonwealth waters is deteriorating, not improving, immersed in a fog of confidentiality. Factor 8 = Arrow Energy Reserves Sitting quietly in the background on the east coast is a large undeveloped resource of 9,000 petajoules of coal seam gas in Surat and Bowen Basins in Queensland, owned equally by Shell and PetroChina following their takeover of Arrow Energy. These reserves would be enough to supply east coast demand for 15 years at current levels of demand. They were originally earmarked for a fourth LNG project in Queensland but the high costs of development put an end to that. Shell and PetroChina have been silent on development of these reserves, but would be closely monitoring the domestic gas prices and working out the best way to play their hand. It has not worked out well so far. They have spent billions of dollars and all they have to show is lots of feasibility studies but only modest levels of gas and electricity production. Should they throw more good money after bad or just get out? Does the east coast gas market work? Yes, after a fashion but it isn’t the well behaved market of general equilibrium econometric models. It is a manic depressive market of booms and busts, irrational exuberance followed by creative destruction. At the end of the day demand has to equal supply but at this stage it is demand that is adjusting, not supply.

    "title": "Was South Australia lucky the lights stayed on last Friday?",
    "date": "06-03-2017 02:39:00 PM",
    "content": "As has been widely reported , ( see here for additional details ) an equipment failure and subsequent spot fires in the Torrens Island B switchyard caused the disconnection of three of Torrens Island Power Station’s four ‘B’ units, each of 200 MW capacity, last Friday 3 March. Prior to the incident the three tripped units were producing just over 400 MW, around 17% of the South Australia’s total electricity demand. In addition, the same incident somehow seems to have caused the near simultaneous tripping of the nearby Pelican Point Power Station which was producing about 220 MW. Referring back to AEMO’s investigation of the SA Black System incident on 28 September last year , the proximate cause identified for the system collapse on that day was the loss of 456 MW of windfarm generation following a series of faults and voltage dips caused by severe storm damage to the transmission system. This raises the obvious question of why the system was able to withstand the loss of significantly more generation on Friday last week, apparently without any widespread load shedding, than the loss which triggered a complete system shutdown last September. Even Friday’s near-miss has already led to fairly predictable but unhelpful finger-pointing and political posturing. A quick search on Twitter will find you some. In this post I’ll look a bit more closely at the sequence of events that is discernible from AEMO’s actual market data, remembering that full investigation into causes and the forensic detail of what happened is ongoing. Immediately before the event Using ez2view ’s Time Travel functionality to view the state of the South Australian region immediately before the event (this SA Schematic snapshot from Dispatch Interval (DI) ending 15:05 AEST shows generator outputs at the beginning of the 5 minute interval, ie at 15:00 AEST or 3:30pm Adelaide daylight saving time): we can see that four Torrens Island B units were running – the four filled circles underneath the station name above – each producing just under 140 MW. Pelican Point’s output of 218 MW is shown just below. In summary, the aggregate supply mix in SA at this time was as follows: A few points about these numbers for those who are looking closely: Wind includes both semi-scheduled and non-scheduled generators; Imports are based on actual metered interconnector flows at 15:00, not the end-of-period dispatch targets for 15:05 shown against Heywood (V-SA) and Murraylink (V-S-MNSP1) in the ez2view screenshot above; Solar PV (est) is based on AEMO’s after-the-fact half hourly estimates of small scale rooftop PV production – I’ve averaged the values given by AEMO for the two intervals 14:30-15:00 and 15:00-15:30; For all these reasons the total supply number shown differs from AEMO’s ‘Scheduled Demand’ value for DI 15:05, but gives a better reflection of total actual supply just before the incident. 5 minutes later Stepping forward to DI 15:10 , the 5 minutes commencing at 15:05 – just two minutes after the incident time of 15:03 reported in AEMO’s Market Notice 57817 as shown above, the SA Schematic view shows this: We see, in comparison with the previous schematic view, that: Two Torrens Island ‘B’ units have tripped – the last two empty circles below the station name, ie units B3 and B4, and station output has reduced by 290 MW ; Pelican Point output has fallen to 19 MW from its previous 218 MW ; despite this loss of nearly 500 MW of generation output, we can’t see obvious material changes in the other generator outputs or interconnector dispatch targets that are nearly large enough to compensate – what’s going on?? Another 5 minutes later Hold that last question while we step forward one more 5 minute Dispatch Interval to show the situation at 15:10, the start time of DI ending 15:15 Now a third Torrens Island unit, B2, has dropped off, reducing station output a further 108 MW (net) leaving only one online unit, and Pelican Point output is zero. We can also see higher interconnector targets than before, but for those doing the sums in their heads, not nearly high enough to offset the cumulative net loss of 621 MW of generation from Torrens Island and Pelican Point in the few minutes since the incident at 15:03. What’s the cause of this apparent discrepancy? Part of the reason is that actual interconnector flows can and do differ significantly from AEMO’s dispatch targets. Often it’s the interconnectors – particularly non-controllable AC interconnectors like Heywood – that take up any differences between what AEMO schedules to occur in a NEM region over every 5 minute Dispatch Interval, and what actually happens. AEMO schedules on the basis of its 5 minute ahead demand forecast , calculates end-of-interval dispatch targets for generators according to current output levels, bids, constraints etc then electronically sends those dispatch instructions to generators’ control systems. As second-to-second variations in demand and generation output occur in the actual power system, a variety of mechanisms – principally ancillary services provided by certain generators – are used to maintain real time supply-demand balance. This can and does result in significant variations in actual outcomes from what AEMO’s schedule assumes will happen . That’s why in the earlier supply mix table for 15:00 I used actual interconnector flows not targets – I’ve updated that table below to show how the mix – and total supply level – changed between 15:00 and 15:10. I’ve also broken out imports across the two separate interconnectors: (The data for these tables are drawn from AEMO’s published market data, but can require a bit of extra manipulation to extract in comparison with standard views in many tools like ez2view ) ‘Missing demand’ and very high interconnector flows may have “saved” the system What first jumps out from the table above is that in the same interval that the first two Torrens Island B units tripped and Pelican Point lost most of its output – effectively somewhere between 15:03 and 15:05 – demand in South Australia must also have dropped by ~300 MW . Supply and demand must remain in real time balance in any electricity system, so absent gross measurement errors – and there is no obvious sign of these – the supply reduction of 307 MW shown at 15:05 must have corresponded with a matching reduction in power demand. There have been no reports of general load shedding associated with the incident, and I have contacted both AEMO and SA Power Networks seeking an explanation – the latter has confirmed that there was no distribution system level general load shedding – neither directed (eg rolling blackouts like those initiated on February 8 ) nor automated (eg Under Frequency Load Shedding protection). Since the load reduction must have occurred very rapidly between 15:03 and 15:05, and well before there were any general calls for the public to conserve electricity later that afternoon , it cannot have been the result of conscious actions by energy users to reduce usage. It’s also apparent that it was a relatively short-term drop, with ~120 MW of load returning by 15:10 (followed by another 105 MW by 15:15, not shown above). I’m afraid the reasons for this remain a mystery at this early stage – if any readers have a convincing explanation I’d be very glad to hear it! What’s also obvious at 15:05 and especially 15:10 (as load picked up and another TIPS B unit went offline) is the very large increase in imports on the Heywood interconnector necessary to maintain supply-demand balance in South Australia. The only other controllable thermal generation remaining online at the time was a single TIPS B unit, the Osborne cogeneration facility and the Ladbroke Grove gas turbines in the South East of the state. The latter two stations were essentially at full output already, while the TIPS B1 unit had only about 70 MW spare capacity, which took 20 minutes to ramp up. Other dispatchable generation started coming online from about 15:10 (principally 60 MW of diesel-fuelled capacity at Port Stanvac followed slightly later by gas turbines at Dry Creek and Quarantine), but in the immediate aftermath of the Torrens Island B and Pelican Point trips it was interconnector flows increasing to (at least) 861 MW on Heywood and by much smaller amounts on Murraylink that balanced the system. That level of import across the Heywood interconnector is well outside its normal secure operating limits of 600-680 MW, and while those limits provide for short term excursions to higher levels than those to cater for defined contingencies, the level shown above is uncomfortably close to the transfer level of 890 MW reached just before separation from Victoria last September, quoted in AEMO’s report on the SA Black System event (see p45). I should stress here that the detailed nature and sequence of events on the two days in question is very different, and especially that the Black System report makes it clear that it was not the absolute level of power flow itself across Heywood on 28 September 2016, but a more complex loss of synchronism / transient instability issue that (correctly) triggered separation of SA from Victoria and the consequent system black in SA. However it remains true that on both days flows on Heywood were pushed well beyond secure operating limits, which are generally set to provide headroom for only “credible” contingencies such as the loss of the largest single generating unit in a region. Losing three Torrens Island B units and Pelican Point in quick succession is well beyond the scope of such credible contingencies. Tentative Conclusions I have no doubt at all that AEMO, Electranet and many others will be looking very closely at the root causes of this incident, particularly the reasons for the near-simultaneous trip of Pelican Point, its impacts, and its implications for system security in South Australia. If the apparent loss of 300 MW of system load at around the same time is confirmed (and I can see no reason why it won’t), its nature and underlying cause will also be fascinating to understand – without that near-immediate relief on total supply requirements for South Australia, it is very hard to see how a trip of the Heywood interconnector (which would then have been attempting to transfer well over 1000 MW into SA) would not have occurred. That in turn would have led with absolute certainty to another system black event, and heavens knows what next-day headlines and political witch-hunts to follow.

    "title": "[UPDATED] AEMO Market Notice on “High Impact Outage” for tomorrow – and possible effect in South Australia",
    "date": "06-03-2017 01:54:00 PM",
    "content": "Thanks to the tips provided by a few of our more knowledgeable readers. In the light of the comments made, I have (on Tuesday 7th) rearranged the following, and added headings, to provide more context With the collective skittishness about South Australia in the broader energy sector at present (not helped by the transformer explosion and subsequent unit trips at Torrens and Pelican Point last Friday ), the following Market Notice from today (Monday 6th) in NEM-Watch about tomorrow (Tuesday 7th) will be of interest to a number of our WattClarity readers: Several points: (A) The possibility of Automatic Underfrequency Load Shedding From 04:30 to 17:00 tomorrow (NEM time, so add 30 minutes to read in Adelaide time) there’s a heightened risk of automated load shedding if the largest single contingency would occur: 1) The contingency they speak of would be for the other Heywood line to trip, thereby forcing South Australia into an “islanded” state. 2) Under such circumstances, no matter what plant (whether gas or wind – or coal, if it was still in operation) was running in SA, the rate-of-change-of-frequency (ROCOF) would be so large that AUFLS would need to occur to keep the system stable. I believe, but have not checked with anyone else, that this was the reason behind what happened on 1st December . 3) Now AEMO could prevent this from happening, by procuring more FCAS services up-front, however a decision was made by back in 2001 (I think following pressure from the SA Government) that had the effect of: (a) Lowering the amount of FCAS purchased on an ongoing basis; in return for (b) Instances like these occurring periodically when interconnector maintenance reduced the redundancy for the SA grid. It may be (I have not checked) that this is the outage that was going to be performed last week, but which was postponed with the dramas at Torrens. (B) Price outlook for tomorrow Looking forward into the AEMO’s current base-case predispatch forecast for South Australia in NEM-Watch in this 13:40 snapshot shows that demand tomorrow is forecast to be higher than today (but notably the peak in demand will be after the outage is scheduled to be completed, and after solar PV injections have waned for the day): In new software (not shown here) being developed following a specific client request, we see the spike in prices forecast for tomorrow afternoon coinciding with a forecast lull in wind farm production (down to about 170MW at 13:00 compared with a forecast peak aggregate wind production of 1,126MW at 22:00 tonight). (C) About the “High Impact Outage” terminology Interestingly, in a quick scan of the total 55,568 Market Notices back to December 1998 we have accessible through our copy of ez2view for the “High Impact Outage” key phrase, the only other times I can find that this particular phrase has been used are 14 other times between July 2011 to November 2012. No wonder it appeared a strange title! I have been told that this term is more frequently used in the NOS. No time to check on this one, today.",

    "title": "Collective skittishness about South Australia?",
    "date": "01-03-2017 10:04:00 AM",
    "content": "Electricity in South Australia has been in the news too much over the past year or more – high prices in Q3 2016 following on from some remarkable pricing patterns (NEM-wide) in Q2 , and then the blackout of 28th September , the event of 1st December , and the smaller* load shed event of 8th February (*not to diminish how it affected those concerned). These actual outcomes have layered onto the longer-lasting undercurrent of shorter-term politicisation (by our current crop of abysmal politicians on all sides) of what is a complex and challenging energy transition that we have embarked upon. Is it any wonder that these have, thus, contributed to what seems (at least to me) to be a lowering in the general level of collective emotional and cognitive resilience with respect to electricity supplies in South Australia. 1) What I’ve been seeing… Here’s one example from social media this morning: There were other examples that I have seen yesterday and today – where the use of “blackout” will be effective in stimulating click-throughs, but perhaps could be too easily misinterpreted (i.e. on many occasions LOR notices are issued, but on the vast majority the market responds to these intended signals by the AEMO). 2) What the numbers say… A quick look at NEM-Watch at 08:50 today shows that prices are indeed higher in South Australia this morning than in other regions – but this, in and of itself, is highly usual at the regular times when wind generation is at the lower end of its range (see this animation of the natural “yin and yang” of wind to understand the different pieces of the same puzzle, if you don’t already): Using ez2view Forecast Convergence to look out over the coming week at successive ST PASA demand forecasts in South Australia , we see the following: In particular, note (in the circle highlighted) that on Sunday 26th, the AEMO was forecasting a moderately high demand level for tomorrow (Thursday 2nd March) but that this forecast has been revised downwards in more recent days – I presume his is because of revised temperature forecasts, but have not invested the time to check. Also keep in mind my prior comments about how forecasting is a mugs game , though we know it is one that AEMO needs to do in order to operate the market successfully. With the decreased demand forecast for tomorrow, it follows that AEMO would be seeing increases in surplus generation forecast for tomorrow – as shown in the Chart View of ez2view Forecast Convergence below: As can be clearly seen on this chart, there are many 5-minute periods over the coming week where South Australia will be heavily dependent on supplies coming in from Victoria (a region that is now only a month away from the closure of its Hazelwood power station ). Flipping to Grid View, we can see the same data here (in this case with the colours inverted and low Surplus Reserve being the red “attention” colour): I’ve highlighted on this chart how there was, on Sunday, a very high negative Surplus Generation forecast for South Australia for Thursday (i.e. now tomorrow) – however from Monday AEMO has progressively downgraded this concern, primarily as a result of the lower demand forecast for tomorrow (but not before we see commentary on social media, like above – and also here, some will say). Which brings to the broader question – in an environment of collectively heightened anxiety and reduced emotional resilience , are we more (or less) likely to make considered, rational decisions about how to get where we are headed? All the challenges are not yet solved (despite what some on the left of the Emotion-o-meter want to believe) but they are solvable. With the risk of knee-jerk reactions and political “fixes” heightened in the current climate, the risk actually increases. Yes, there is an “energy crisis” of sorts that has been evolving (and has been spoken about for some years, including on WattClarity ) – but we need to rationally think through to “root causes” to have a chance of making it better, not worse. I have extremely low faith that our current crop of politicians (on all sides) have the competence, or the interest, to do this.",

    "content": "As frequent readers to WattClarity would know, we’re a Brisbane-based software company that operates in the Australian energy sector. As such, we have a team of people who have a higher awareness of the energy sector than would be the case across the general population. This is the case with respect to solar power, as it is with many other different aspects of the energy sector. Particularly with respect to residential solar PV, we have employees who fit into each of the following 3 categories: Category 1 = we have a number of employees who are fortunate enough to receive the very generous, long-lasting 44 cents feed-in tariff (including our CEO, as he noted here ); Category 2 = we have other employees (like Jamey, featured in this article) who missed out on this opportunity, but who has solar PV installed; and Category 3 = we have other employees who (because of renting, renovating, or other reasons) are not able to access any benefits from their own solar. The recent demise of start-up retailer, Urth Energy ( suspended from the market by the AEMO on 1 st February ) was an unfortunate development on this path of the energy transition. Back in September 2016, Urth launched its “Urth Trader” product that provided the opportunity for residential customers with solar PV installed to receive spot pricing for their solar output. One of our employees, Jamey, is one of the 780 customers referenced in this AFR article as affected by this demise . Given Jamey’s unique position in this development, we thought that Jamey’s perspective on the demise of Urth Energy would be informative in terms of this particular situation – but also in more general terms with respect to a number of broader topics including: 1) the general push for a “fair price for solar” ; 2) the increased volatility inherent in the market – and hence the increased risk faced by all retailers, but particularly new entrants , leading to increased likelihood of failure. This week I have asked Jamey the following questions, and have included his answers below: Q1) When, and why, did you install your solar system at home? Jamey: In around October 2013, I installed a 5kW Solar PV array which included x20 qCell G3-Pro Panels and a SMA Sunnyboy Inverter. I had only just purchased my home so unfortunately I had missed the deadline to register for the QLD Government’s 44c Feed in Tariff. Like most people who have installed solar, I did so to offset my energy costs. At the time of my installation, the QLD government were offering a feed in rate of 8c, and my chosen retailer was also offering 8c, which meant I was getting a total of 16c per kW – not the greatest return compared to others, but still a sufficient reimbursement. A few months later, the government stopped the 8c tariff altogether and the retailer dropped down to 6c which meant a 10c per kW (or 62.5%) drop. Q2) What do you think, about not being eligible for the 44c Feed in Tariff? Jamey: It seems obscenely unfair. Those who were lucky enough to sign up before the deadline for the government tariff are still eligible for a retailer feed in meaning that most are receiving more than 50c per kW, which is over seven times more than I am being paid. It is crazy to think that these people are being paid twice as much as what it costs them to import a kW AND they do not have to pay tax on their profits either. Q3) What options have you looked at to secure your best return for your solar investment? Jamey: I was previously on Click Energy’s ‘Shine Reward Plan’ that offered an 11c feed in but also raised usage charges to 6% and raised the daily supply charge to 14% above their standing offer and also included a solar metering charge. I originally switched to Urth Energy as they offered a similar feed in rate as Click without inflating the usage and daily supply charges. I export twice as much energy as I consume so this option made the most sense for me at the time. Q4) How did you learn of the demise of Urth Energy? Jamey: I found out through our CEO, Paul McArdle on the 1st of February who had seen the notice in an AER (Australian Energy Regulator) mail out. After hearing the news through Paul, I immediately called up Urth Energy and did not get through after 45 minutes of trying. I then tried to email the company but did not receive a response, so a couple of days later I called the AER who told me that I was automatically going to be transferred to Origin Energy as part of their ‘Retailer of Last Resort’ process. I was not happy with this arrangement, as I knew that based on the way in which I import and export electricity, Origin Energy was not going to offer me the best return for my specific situation. As such, I called Origin Energy who told me that they did not have an account for me to cancel with them. By this time I had decided to move back to Click Energy to secure their 11c feed in but found that their staff had no idea about the Retailer of Last Resort arrangement. After several days of getting the run-around from Click Energy’s staff, I finally arrived at a resolution after contacting the Queensland Energy and Water Ombudsman who facilitated me getting in contact with the correct person at Click Energy who could help. It wasn’t until the 16th of February, which was more than two weeks after Urth Energy was suspended from the market that I finally got an official email from the appointed administrators of Urth Energy telling me that they were no longer in operation. The Urth Energy website still has a ‘Sign Up Online’ button on their homepage, and it wasn’t until recently that they’ve added a note to confirm that the business has gone into voluntary administration. The Urth Energy website as at the 28th of February, 2017 Q5) How much communication has there been about this, through official channels? Has this been sufficient? Jamey: As noted above, if it was not for my employment within the energy sector, I would not have known about these arrangements until more than two weeks after my retailer had ceased operations. The communication that I have received from all parties involved including Urth Energy, the AER and Origin has been totally insufficient. Q6) What are your thoughts on the “Retailer of Last Resort” arrangements? Jamey: Customers should have been notified of the situation much earlier than they were in this situation. Nobody should be automatically forced onto any particular retailer, unless perhaps they do not organise a replacement retailer within some reasonable time frame. Q7) What are your next steps, in terms of your next retailer? Jamey : As mentioned above I decided against moving to Origin Energy as their 6c feed-in meant that I would receive a lower return than I could get through Click’s 11c feed-in (even after adjusting for their higher usage, supply and metering charges). After researching different rates from all of the retailers in the market, I concluded that returning to Click Energy was going to make the most financial sense for me. Based on Jamey’s experience it seems as though the ‘Retailer of Last Resort’ arrangements need to reviewed and the process improved. Given the disruption under way, it is almost guaranteed that more retailers (and maybe even some of the bigger ones) will go bust, which means we need to be better prepared as an industry for what to do when this happens. This is something we first talked about on WattClarity in late 2014 . There is still no real information available regarding Urth Energy’s demise, which might lead some to conclude (probably wrongly) that it was due to spot priced solar exports. The more likely reality is that Urth Energy went bust for either of two reasons: a. Not enough cash flow (a problem for most small businesses); or b. Spot volatility hurt them badly (we expect that the high volatility of late is hurting a number of retailers). Given Jamey and others’ keenness to shop around for what is, in fact, a pretty small benefit in financial terms (i.e. comparing plans), we wonder what this means in terms of market opportunities – is this part of the reason why there have been so many new retailers join the market in the past 12-18 months? We hope to post more specific commentary about the “Urth Trader” business model (spot-priced-solar) in the near future.",

    "date": "23-02-2017 10:52:00 AM",
    "content": "Following on from a couple of pretty stressful weeks in the NEM for many affected parties – but particularly for energy users : 1) who will pay higher prices (either straight away if spot exposed, or in the future, if not); 2) who have seen reliability threatened – and in some cases have actually lost supply for a time. It’s not really a surprise to see a significant amount of press coverage, in the aftermath, about a number of aspects of the crisis – including: 1) What actually happened – and, on this note, we hope that WattClarity is proving of some value; 2) Who was involved (and, for some who like to point fingers, who or what is to “blame”); and 3) A range of “gadgets” (if we loosely term them as such) being promoted by their providers, and their supporters, as potential/partial “solutions” to the crisis. Demand Response is just one of these – as I have noted over here today on the dedicated demand response site . In particular, I would like highlight this article in the AFR with the provocative title that seems to claim that all of the generators and retailers in the market (presumably including all the innovative start-ups as well) banded together to kill one of these solutions: Two points I would like to flag here: 1) In the article, the point seems to be made that an assumed amount of demand response active in the NEM (implied at only 235MW) is way lower than that seen in other markets elsewhere. However this number is a gross under-estimation that somehow keeps being repeated: (a) It seems to imply that the independent consultants employed by the AEMC were somehow conned in their investigation process. For comparison purposes, we’ve linked here what an outline from the consultants (Oakley Greenwood) in terms of what they actually found in relation to the amount of demand response currently active in the NEM . (b) It’s also substantially lower than the MW rate of consumption represented of clients we serve who operate to supply a form of demand response into the NEM (as we have explained before), with that volume growing in recent times as energy users grow more sophisticated, as some retail energy brokers more educated, and as price volatility increases. And we’re just one company! 2) The tone of this article (and the general push for the adoption of a “negawatt buyback model” as a new form of demand response) seems to be one that pushes the line that incumbency should automatically mean that people can disqualify the submissions of “Big Power” (print above) or “electricity cartel” (online) as invalid . When did this become the case ? Is this not forgetting that there are a number of innovative start-ups (including new retailers, and others) operating in the space to make demand response work within existing rules – hence lowering the risk of unintended (or known, but overlooked) consequences . For those interested in some more of the gory details, beyond the sound bites, note that I have previously written about the rule change process for the negawatt buyback model here in June 2014 , and here in November 2015 .",

    "title": "Small solar owners saved the NSW electricity market $888 million during heatwave",
    "date": "22-02-2017 03:58:00 PM",
    "content": "New South Wales recently experienced a severe heatwave, which saw parts of the state exceed 45°C. These extreme conditions put significant strain on the electricity market from the 9th to the 11th of February 2017. During this three day period, small solar PV (i.e. PV systems that are not registered as generators in the NEM), generated about 17 GWh of power. This was 2% of the state’s total power needs. If we match up small solar generation with the wholesale price in the NSW market, we can see that small solar was worth about $9.6 million, or $550/MWh. However, a small solar owner is lucky to receive 8 c/kWh or $80/MWh as a feed-in tariff. The story of the value of small solar during the heatwave doesn’t stop there. The interesting question to me was how would the electricity market cope if there was no small solar. This is difficult to quantify, but my attempt considered three factors: What would electricity demand in NSW look like if the generation from small solar had to be met by the market. Data published by the Australian PV Institute was used for this analysis. Given this new demand profile, what would the 30 min electricity price be in the wholesale market. To develop the likely set of prices without small solar, the 5 min bid stacks published by AEMO were examined for each period where small solar was generating power. What would be the cost to the market with small solar (i.e. the actual cost that was incurred) vs the cost without small solar (i.e. the estimate derived from 1 & 2). Figure 1 shows the data for the 9-11 Feb 2017 study period. The light green shading shows the actual electricity demand that was seen by the market. The dark green shading shows the estimated generation from small solar PV. The effect of small solar was to reduce the length of peak demand and to push the peak to later in the afternoon. The black line is the actual 30 min pool price that was seen in the NSW wholesale market. The grey line is the pricing that would have resulted if the power generated by small solar had to be met by the market, assuming that bidding behaviour remained the same . Under these conditions, the effect of small solar was to significantly depress pricing in the wholesale market. Furthermore, it is likely that AEMO would have called for involuntary load shedding during the afternoon of Friday 10 Feb, as there were periods with not enough generation bids to meet the extra demand that small solar was covering. The final consideration is the total cost impact to the market with and without small solar. In part 2, we derived the likely pricing without small solar. However, it is not just the solar portion of demand that would be subject to this new pricing. The way that the NEM is settled means that the entire demand in the state for a given 30 min trading interval would be subject to the new 30 min price. Figure 2 shows the daily electricity cost in the NSW wholesale market with small solar (i.e. the actual costs incurred by market participants) and without small solar (derived from our analysis). Over the three day period, small solar reduced the cost to the market by roughly $888 million. Even though small solar only covered 2% of electricity demand, it cut the price of electricity by 60% from an estimated volume weighted average price of $1920/MWh to $780/MWh. This article was originally published on LinkedIn . Note: In this “what would have happened?” analysis, Energy Synapse have (necessarily) made a number of simplifying assumptions. This is standard procedure in this type of analysis. The region-specific as-dispatched bid stacks have been used, with an increment in terms of additional Scheduled Demand, to calculate the “what would have been” prices. In doing this: Simplification #1 = it has been assumed that bid behaviour would not have changed; and Simplification #2 = no account has been taken of how underlying constraint behaviour might have changed the dispatch (hence pricing) outcome with this additional Scheduled Demand in place.

    "title": "How tight demand/supply situations can make solar forecasting important",
    "date": "21-02-2017 12:21:00 PM",
    "content": "NSW demand rose to a near-record high on Friday the 10th of February , and QLD soared to a new record demand on that Sunday , amidst an intense heatwave. While this heat-stressed our electricity markets and infrastructure, the nation’s rooftop solar PV systems were providing critical load reduction under plentiful sunshine. A quick review of APVI data from 10 February shows that in Queensland an estimated 5.5% of the mid-day demand was met by small-scale solar (at peak solar production), falling with the setting sun to around 1.5-2% during the 5-6PM(AEDT) peak demand period. Even at a low proportion of total energy generation, this contribution was very important. According to APVI ~400MW of generation from small-scale PV was present at 5PM (AEDT), with ~200MW at 6PM. This contribution proved to be particularly important during the period where AEMO was forecasting a 310MW shortfall in generation; shortly before load shedding commenced just after 6PM (AEDT). But even with the great intel from the APVI Live Solar PV map, the market was still left guessing about the near term reliability of that small-scale solar resource. Simply put, there are no forecasts of the near future power output that update based on real cloud and PV output data. Turning our attention instead to AEMO’s forecasting products, we can find some forecasting support for rooftop solar is provided by the ASEFS2 model, which was implemented by German wind energy consultant Overspeed and updates a few times per day. This model can be quite useful – in certain situations. Sunny days are straightforward. Even slow moving synoptic weather events can be well forecast by this product. But it has a significant Achilles’ heel… I’m talking about clouds. Fast moving and fast-changing ones in particular. Cloud cover affects our electricity markets all of the time, yet such impacts are not well understood, nor are they well predicted by the forecasting solutions currently available to our energy market. So why is this important? Look no further than the cloud cover impacting the Broken Hill solar farm during the critical 5-6PM (AEDT) period. With 53MW of solar installed in 1 location; singular cloud features have the power to ramp up and down over very short time windows. And it did just that, with power output suddenly falling about 30MW around 5PM local time. At present, without active cloud tracking and forecasting, this type of situation is (seemingly) unpredictable. One can easily extend this circumstance to introduce fast moving clouds over the concentrated small-scale solar resources in Sydney and the NSW coast, and the state’s total solar resource could have fallen further by a few hundreds of MW inside 30 minutes. Under the forecasting resources currently available to the market, this would happen seemingly without warning. The cost and impacts of such an event would have been quite noticeable. This type of sudden change in solar PV power output isn’t limited to NSW, and isn’t driven only by one type of cloud cover situation. Fast changes in collective rooftop solar power output happen frequently (checkout my publication on this topic) and they have real impacts on supply-demand balance across the NEM. Worse, our current solutions (e.g. ASEFS2) can’t help us. This was part of the motivation for the founding of Solcast, a new solar forecasting company partnered with The Australian National University. Solcast have recently launched a new solar forecasting service, which actively predicts the nation’s solar resource using satellite and PV data, updating every ten minutes. Solcast applies machine learning and computer vision techniques to forecast the future position of Australia’s cloud cover. With the location and thickness of the cloud cover in hand, Solcast applies radiation modelling techniques to estimate the types and amounts of radiation available at the Earth’s surface. This allows us to continually update the forecasting product, tracking any new developments in cloud cover features. Using this technology, we thought it might be interesting to look once again at last Friday in NSW. Throughout the day, Solcast’s tech was tracking the extensive cloud band across southern Australia, which began to bite into Victorian solar supply by mid-day. These cloud features are the type of upper-level cloud formations that reduce solar power supply by 10-20%, but do little to immediately relieve the extreme heat in urban settings. By 3PM (AEDT), Solcast’s updated forecasts were converging across the ensembles, producing highly confident NSW small-scale solar forecasts for the 4-6PM period, during a time where load-shedding was looking imminent and the energy market increasingly constrained: Solcast was also producing forecasts for solar farms. Looking back at Broken Hill, we find a few very interesting things. First, we correctly forecast that there would be a large drop in power output at the farm. Shown below is our estimated actual from the farm, produced through use of satellite observation from a particular time-step, along with our 4:30PM (AEDT) issued forecast (blue). Digging in a bit deeper, we can even find the origins of this drop in power production by reviewing our cloud opacity estimates. Convective cloud cover was present, with fast-moving, fast-changing clouds reducing the power output of the farm quickly, before clearing and ramping it back up again. In the image above, we see 30 minute averages (to match the market), but in the image below we see where the 10 minute sampling rate of the satellite becomes incredibly useful, as we capture and forecast the rapidly evolving cloud features. This critical period from 10 February is precisely the type of situation that Solcast is aiming to help with. With such high penetrations of small-scale solar present across Australia and several new large solar farms in the pipeline, Solcast believes that this type of technology will be important for maintaining predictability and stability in our power system.

    "content": "Load shedding in South Australia on Wednesday 8 February and successive ‘close shaves’ in NSW and Queensland as the heatwave spread north have exposed serious weaknesses in the national electricity market (NEM). For some time now, it has been fashionable to blame South Australia’s near 40 per cent renewable (wind) generation mix for outages in that state. However, reliability problems in regions with much less renewable generation underline that the challenges facing the power system are much more complex and extend far beyond South Australia. The NEM’s ‘energy only’ market design means that generators get paid when they are called to run, but not otherwise. It was and remains a fundamentally sound basis for organising generation markets. [1] However, the consequences of some poorly-conceived interventions in that market design are now starting to show. At the time of its instigation, the bi-partisan renewable energy target (RET) seemed straight-forward: mandate that purchasers of wholesale electricity buy an increasing proportion from renewable sources, and impose stiff penalties for non-compliance. Few appreciated that subsidising one form of generation amounted to imposing a tax on all others. Compounded by weak demand growth since 2009, the RET has driven a steady exodus of fossil fuel generators from the market. Some aging, CO2 heavy, coal-fired plants had in any case passed their time and needed to go if carbon reduction targets are to be met. But several much newer, CO2 light, gas-fired plants have also been mothballed – squeezed between high domestic gas prices and electricity market revenues deflated by subsidised wind turbines. These forces have caused the once contemplated role of gas as the ‘transition fuel’ to a much lower carbon generation mix not to materialise, so that we now have a sub-optimal generation portfolio with too few highly reliable, shoulder- and peak-period generators. With the planned closure of the giant 1600 MW Hazelwood plant next month, market rules and operating protocols must be adapted quickly if the past week’s problems are not to be much worse come the summer of 2017/18. Here are five suggestions warranting close attention: The protocols and norms by which market operator AEMO makes decisions need careful review, so that the system is run more conservatively and with greater emphasis on the consequences of ‘getting it wrong’ – for example, in assessing capacity requirements in South Australia, AEMO assumes a contribution towards peak demand from wind of nine per cent, yet when demand was high last Wednesday the weather delivered only half that amount. On its face, a much more cautious approach is needed. Greater caution as to target levels of supply reliability would also assist the case for AEMO invoking its ‘reliability and emergency reserve trader’ powers more frequently and, longer term, for much stronger interconnection between NEM regions. Heatwaves rarely hit all of the south eastern states simultaneously, and providing for greater diversity of supply across regions is critical. The generator playing field must be levelled so that the structural disadvantage imposed by the RET on forms of generation that can be scheduled with very high reliability (eg, fossil-fuelled and solar-thermal units) is eliminated, thereby improving the incentives to invest in this form of capacity. There should be no need to throw out the energy-only market design, but there is opportunity for market-saving innovation, perhaps by introducing a price premium for output from scheduled generation, paid for by a discount on the output from semi-scheduled generators (mostly, wind) that only ‘turn up when they can’. The market price cap should be raised so that it more closely reflects the cost to customers of losing load, and encourages peaking plant to be more available – even if deployed for just a few days per year. For the energy only market design to work as intended, it must not prevent peak period prices from reflecting the high cost of load shedding or non-supply. Ensuring the demand side of the market can see and respond to high price events would also assist energy consumers to make informed choices on peak days. Lastly, the Victorian and NSW governments could assist by easing their moratoria on gas exploration and development, and facilitating arrangements that enable land-owners to share a greater proportion of the potential value of onshore gas reserves. Improved availability would take the pressure off domestic gas prices and strengthen the viability of gas-fired generation. The first four of these measures would all add to the cost of generating and delivering electricity, and so the prices paid by consumers, while the fifth is also far from popular. However, the cost to consumers and the economy as a whole of an unreliable power system is a much higher price to pay. Decarbonising our energy system involves hard choices, and time is running out for those choices to be made. Greg Houston was interviewed in relation to the challenges facing the NEM on ABC’s 7.30, Monday 13 February. See: http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2017/s4619264.htm [1] By contrast, generators in Western Australia (not part of the eastern states market) get paid just for being available, and WA consumers now pay a high premium for capacity they do not need.

    "content": "As I noted a year ago, for many months we have been thinking through the implications of “free energy” and what it would mean to the electricity sector – both in the NEM and elsewhere – on this ongoing energy transition . This morning I see in the AFR an article about battery manufacturer, Sonnen, and their plans to provide customers free energy in return for the ability to export from their residential energy systems at key times of grid (and/or market) stress . 1) We have expected a range of different innovations to emerge in terms of business models – some will succeed, whilst some (at least in the Urth incarnation – more on that later) won’t. 2) We’re keenly focused on ensuring our business can serve these new businesses as they emerge. Given that it looks set to combine two of our technologies of particular interest, I have also posted briefly about this: 1) On our specially-focused Demand Response website ; and 2) On our (relatively newer) specially-focused Battery Storage website , an industry that a growing number see in the early stages of an “S-Curve” deployment rate.",

    "title": "Key Events Timeline – NSW Friday 10 Feb 2017",
    "date": "16-02-2017 11:46:00 AM",
    "content": "A timeline of key market events & announcements in NSW last Friday, now that the dust has settled somewhat. The reasons for and full details of some of these events are not yet fully clear. No doubt more information will emerge in coming days. Times are given in the format “ Market Time (Sydney Time)” to reduce confusion. Market Time is Australian Eastern Standard Time and Sydney Time is one hour later because of daylight saving. Thu 17:15 (6:15pm) AEMO issues “Predispatch PASA” LOR (Lack of Reserve) notices showing the following forecast Lack of Reserve conditions in NSW for Friday . AEMO’s maximum Scheduled Demand forecasts for Friday afternoon at 14,581 MW (half hourly basis). LOR1 : 11:30 (12:30pm) to 13:30 (2:30pm) LOR2: 13:00 (2:00pm) to 15:00 (4:00pm) LOR3: 15:00 (4:00pm) to 17:30 (6:30pm) : maximum deficit – 419 MW LOR2: 17:30 (6:30pm) to 19:00 (8:00pm) LOR1: 19:00 (8:00pm) to 20:30 (9:30pm) “Reserve” is the surplus of available supply (online generation and available interconnector flows) over demand. LOR3 means negative reserve ie insufficient supply to meet demand. “Actual LOR3” would represent load shedding (as occurred in South Australia on Wednesday 8 Feb). LOR2 means that one defined contingency – typically loss of the largest generator in the region – would result in negative reserve, ie LOR3. LOR1 effectively means that two successive contingencies – ie loss of largest two generators – would result in negative reserve. Fri 10:36 (11:36am) AEMO updates LOR notices for the afternoon / evening of Friday. Maximum Scheduled Demand forecasts steady at 14,587 MW : LOR1 : 12:00 (1:00pm) to 14:30 (3:30pm) LOR2: 14:30 (3:30pm) to 16:00 (5:00pm) LOR3: 16:00 (5:00pm) to 17:00 (6:00pm) : maximum deficit – 77 MW LOR2: 17:00 (6:00pm) to 18:30 (7:30pm) LOR1: 18:30 (7:30pm) to 20:30 (9:30pm) This represents some forecast easing of the situation – in particular the negative reserve / LOR3 window is now one hour with a minimum deficit of 77 MW vs two and half hours previously with a deficit of 419 MW. 11:30 (12:30pm) AEMO’s maximum Scheduled Demand forecasts now peaking at 14,735 MW for the half hour ending 16:30 (5:30pm). 13:00 (2:00pm) AEMO announces Actual LOR1 condition commencing from 12:50 (1:50pm) forecast to remain until 20:00 (9pm), broadly in line with the morning update. Maximum Scheduled Demand forecast unchanged. 13:16 (2:16pm) AEMO updates forecast LOR2 conditions as: LOR2: 14:30 (3:30pm) to 16:00 (5:00pm) and 17:00 (6:00pm) to 18:30 (7:30pm) – (effectively no change on morning update) AEMO determines that the latest time at which it would need to intervene to increase system reserve would be 14:30 (3:30pm) 13:28 (2:28pm) AEMO updates forecast LOR3 condition as: LOR3: 16:00 (5:00pm) to 17:00 (6:00pm) : maximum deficit –189 MW – A slight worsening of the forecast reserve deficit ~ 14:00 (3:00pm) Press reports appear online indicating that electricity supplier AGL has issued a curtailment notice to the Tomago aluminium smelter for rolling supply interruptions at each of its three potlines (~ 310 MW of load each) for successive periods of up to 1 hour and 15 minutes , ie 3 hours and 45 minutes in total, commencing from 14:45 (3:45pm). A later media statement from AGL provides further details of the contractual arrangement relied upon by AGL in issuing this notice. ~14:05 (3:05pm) NSW demand which had been growing strongly through the day in line with or above AEMO’s forecasts, begins to flatten / grow more slowly, falling below AEMO forecasts (shown below in a view from ez2view ’s Forecast Convergence widget). Actual demand for the day ultimately peaked at around 14,000 MW (slightly lower on a half hourly basis, slightly higher on a 5 minute basis), but significantly lower than the original maximum forecast: 14:35 (3:35pm) Colongra open cycle gas turbine power station located between Gosford and Newcastle , owned by Snowy Hydro, commences unloading from output of 644 MW , in accordance with bid prices & volumes submitted earlier in the day. Output reduces to zero by 15:15 (4:15pm). Snowy’s Tumut 3 hydro station commences ramping up from 640 MW towards 1,700 MW. Spot price in NSW has remained below $300-$340/MWh through the day so far. 15:35- 16:10 (4:35-5:10pm) several dispatch price spikes to 4-digit levels as demand continues to grow, highest $7,565/MWh. 16:19 (5:19pm) AEMO cancels LOR3 condition previously forecast for 17:00 (6:00pm) to 18:00 (7:00pm). 16:20-16:25 (5:20-5:25pm) EnergyAustralia’s Tallawarra gas-fired combined cycle power station located south of Sydney on Lake Illawarra trips from near full load of 408 MW to zero output due to a plant failure / forced outage. Dispatch price spikes to $14,000/MWh essentially remaining at that level until 18:10 (7:10pm). Highlighted below is EnergyAustralia’s capacity rebid entered at 16:26 (5:26pm) shown in a view from ez2view ’s Bids & Offers tool: 16:30 (5:30pm) Import flows and scheduled targets on interconnectors supplying NSW from Queensland and Victoria commence exceeding system security constraint limits , remaining outside these limits by up to ~800 MW until 17:10 (6:10pm). 16:34-16:54 (5:34-5:54pm) Colongra makes a rapid series of rebids, initially showing the entire station as unavailable for the rest of the day, then reducing the period of unavailability until 17:30 (6:30pm), then showing 3 units as available from 17:00 (6:00pm) – the resulting availability profile is shown below in a further ez2view screenshot. Information in the rebid reasons given for these and later availability changes indicate that the station may have been preparing to switch between gas and liquid-fuel firing at this time. The location of Colongra on the gas supply network limits the amount of pipeline gas that the station can draw in a day to the equivalent of 5 hours running at full capacity : 16:44 (5:44pm) AEMO declares Actual LOR2 condition for the period 16:35 (5:35pm) to 17:30 (6:30pm), states that minimum forecast reserve level is 675 MW . ~17:00-17:10 (6:00pm – 6:10pm) Large fall in 5 minute demands seen in NSW , ~ 600 MW. Interconnector flows return within security limits. 17:20 (6:20pm) AEMO announces that an Actual LOR3 condition has existed from 16:50 (5:50pm), forecast to remain until 18:00 (7:00pm) . “Actual LOR3” means actual interruption of customer load as stated in AEMO’s notice, however unlike South Australia two days earlier there was no general rotational load shedding , so presumably the load interrupted was that at Tomago 17:15 – 17:40 (6:15pm – 6:40pm) Colongra gas turbines recommence production, reaching maximum output of 480 MW (one out of four units not running). 17:43 (6:43pm) AEMO issues market notice indicating that it has Directed a Market Participant, Direction issued at 16:58 (5:58pm) and expected to be in place until 18:00 (7:00pm) 18:10-18:15 (7:10-7:15pm) Dispatch price falls from $14,000/MWh to ~$100/MWh 18:12 (7:12pm) AEMO announces cancellation of Direction from 18:01 (7:01pm) 18:26 (7:26pm) AEMO announces cancellation of Actual LOR3 effective from 18:05 (7:05pm) The final chart below summarises graphically movements in some of the key market data referred to in this timeline, with references to a number of the events listed above: About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

    "title": "Examining why Pelican Point didn’t bid full capacity into the NEM on Wednesday 8 February",
    "date": "13-02-2017 07:59:00 PM",
    "content": "As I warned in my first post on the controlled load shedding that took place in South Australia last Wednesday , there has been near-continuous coverage of the event and the reasons for it, and of course of the subsequent near-misses in NSW ( see the collection of Paul’s posts here for how that day evolved , with more to come when we catch our breath). I’m going to focus here on the reasons given for the gas-fired Pelican Point Power Station in Adelaide not bidding its full capacity into the market on Wednesday 8 February before and during the period when load shedding occurred, despite the fact that it was able to make that capacity available on Thursday evening when “ directed ” by AEMO. This is a complex issue and has been the subject of heated debate. Nothing presented here is intended to be conclusive nor exhaustive, but simply an attempt to provide context then dissect and explain a bit more fully some of the information that has so far been put into the public domain. I would also point readers to a couple of other relevant pieces published recently: lawyer Graeme Dennis’s succinct commentary on the NEM rules and gas supply, explaining in general “why gas power stations can’t just be started up straight away” energy consultant Hugh Saddler’s broader overview of the reasons for the load shedding published on The Conversation In this post I’ll be going into more detail on the specific issues affecting Pelican Point. First some background. Pelican Point PS Configuration Pelican Point is a gas-fired combined cycle plant built in 1999-2001 comprising two 160 MW gas turbines (GTs) and a 158 MW steam turbine, with a total registered capacity of 478 MW . Each GT directly drives its own generator, and their hot exhaust gases are fed into specialised boilers (“Heat Recovery Steam Generators”) which produce high pressure steam driving the third turbogenerator. With a single GT operating, the plant is capable of roughly half its nominal output (full GT output plus about half of the steam turbine capacity). Although there are three physical generating units, for market bidding and dispatch purposes Pelican Point is registered with AEMO as a single “aggregated unit”. Reduced Operation Since early 2013, Pelican Point has operated only rarely at full capacity, and prior to last Friday, not since March 2015, as seen in this chart of weekly maximum availability (ie capacity bid into the NEM) and output from global-roam’s NEM-Review historical market data analysis product: Pelican Point’s majority owner Engie has stated that there is “no commercial rationale to operate the second Pelican Point unit in the current market environment in SA for a small number of days across the year” . Thus the station has been operating only a single gas turbine unit supplemented by (up to) half the output of the steam turbogenerator, in total capable of around 220-240 MW under summer conditions – slightly more output is available in winter. Gas Supply and Transportation Gas for the station can be delivered from either the Moomba to Adelaide pipeline ( MAPS ) carrying gas from the Cooper Basin, or the SEA Gas pipeline carrying gas from western Victoria. A critical factor for gas powered generators is the maximum rate at which they can draw gas from their supplying pipeline system(s) , generally specified in terms of a Maximum Hourly Quantity of gas, or MHQ . Physically, the rate at which a station like Pelican Point draws gas is broadly proportional to its current output. Commercially , the station must have rights under its gas supply and transportation arrangements to use gas at that rate. Although we obviously do not have information on Engie’s specific arrangements, in general on long distance commercial pipelines such as MAPS and SEA Gas, if a pipeline user with a contracted level of supply takes gas at rates exceeding their maximum right to MHQ for any length of time, they will almost certainly be in breach of their contract conditions, face material contractual cost penalties (“overrun charges”) and be at some risk of having gas supply physically curtailed. The same media release linked to above states that “the second Pelican Point unit has no gas contracts in place” . In practice, gas contracts would not be particular to operation of a specific GT unit at Pelican Point, so my interpretation of Engie’s statement is that its current gas supply and transportation arrangements only provide enough MHQ to operate one GT at its full output . Bidding and Dispatching Additional Capacity into the NEM Engie’s statement includes the following critical sentence: “Under the National Electricity Market (NEM) rules, generators can not bid plant into the market if supply can’t be guaranteed” ** I am not in a position to comment in detail on this statement which would require a closer scrutiny of the National Electricity Rules and other data than time allows. However it appears entirely logical, since the market’s real time dispatch processes necessarily assume that generator bids are capable of being fulfilled – ie following AEMO’s dispatch instructions – immediately they are called upon. For the purposes of this analysis I shall assume Engie’s statement is an accurate reflection of the market rules. ** The important implication of this statement and the considerations above is that in order to bid more Pelican Point capacity than available from running one GT, Engie would need certainty of access to additional MHQ . To run Pelican Point at higher output levels requires two GT units in service and would require drawing gas at higher hourly rates. To allow this, the station would have to enter into some form of additional gas supply and transportation deal(s) to contractually support these higher rates. Such deals could be longer term contracts for increased amounts of gas and / or transportation, or possibly short term “spot” deals with either the pipeline operator and / or another gas user holding supply and transportation rights. But note that there is no guarantee that either form of deal – particularly a short term (and almost certainly short-notice) spot arrangement can be negotiated on acceptable commercial terms as and when required. Another key point here is that either form of deal would require an increased financial commitment to pay for rights to additional gas and / or transportation – at least part of which would be payable whether or not the additional plant capacity was dispatched and those rights therefore used. Based on its media statement , Engie clearly judged some time ago that entering longer term contracts for MHQ beyond operation of one GT was not commercial. This left only the shorter term “spot” gas deal as a possible option for bidding and running more than one GT on a particular day or days last week. Why didn’t Engie do this last Wednesday? Market Outlook for SA, Wednesday Feb 8 One answer might be that no such spot gas deal was possible in the timeframe required. Another might be that based on conditions at the time that any deal might have been needed and able to be negotiated, the market outlook did not lead Engie to decide that this was likely to be commercial. We have to remember that the NEM is broadly designed to work through its participants making commercial judgements – which may prove sound or otherwise – in response to price signals, within the manifold rules of the market . AEMO is ultimately responsible for overseeing and maintaining system security and has various powers of intervention, direction and so forth if it judges that participants’ commercial actions and likely market responses are insufficient to deliver that system security. Here’s a chart from the earlier post looking at Feb 8 , using ez2view ’s Forecast Convergence tool to show how AEMO’s demand forecasts for South Australia evolved on the day: The key takeout from this chart is how AEMO’s predispatch demand forecasts, updated every half hour through the day, systematically underestimated actual demand outcomes and even late in the afternoon did not foresee the continuing rapid rise in demand which by 6pm forced load shedding to maintain system security (all times are NEM time, AEST, and so half an hour earlier than Adelaide daylight saving time). From market participants’ perspective, AEMO’s accompanying predispatch price forecasts , shown here in ez2view ’s Forecast Convergence grid view, are an important commercial indicator: This chart shows the evolution of successive on the day price forecasts made between 2pm and 6pm, for the period out to about 10pm. Before 3pm, extreme 5-digit prices were not being forecast by the market systems, with maximum afternoon prices showing as around $300-$600/MWh. If Engie had been seeking to offer additional generation capacity from Pelican Point by late in the afternoon, by 3pm, or probably even earlier, it almost certainly would need to have arranged additional gas & transportation and commenced readying its second unit for startup. And whilst ongoing spot prices of $300 – $600/MWh would be very profitable for operation of a CCGT plant like Pelican Point at gas prices even up to $20-30/GJ, the logistics, economics, and risks of arranging short term spot gas supply (if possible) then starting and stopping a second GT for a forecast short run of only a few hours at such prices – which were not necessarily certain to occur – evidently didn’t seem compelling to Engie. In any case it is clear that on the day Engie did not prearrange additional gas enabling it to offer to the market capacity beyond one GT. None of this is to say that Engie’s decisions prior to or on the day were correct, incorrect, <insert adjective of choice here> … The purpose of the above analysis is to look more deeply at the factors and constraints acting on their decision and ability to offer or not offer that capacity under the market rules. AEMO Direction – 9 February Finally, we also know from Engie’s media statement that on Thursday 9 February capacity from the second GT unit was made available, following a direction from AEMO – here is the capacity rebid seen in ez2view ’s Bid Details widget: AEMO’s relevant market notice shows that this direction was formally made at 15:05 NEM time, although there had presumably been discussions throughout the day to ensure that the direction was capable of being followed – including confirming that additional short term gas supply could be arranged. Under Direction from AEMO, a participant is entitled to recovery of its net costs, regardless of market price outcomes, with Engie’s media release emphasising this point: “However, once ENGIE was directed on by AEMO on February 9, we were able to promptly start the second unit, ensuring our costs were covered, including gas to operate the unit.” All this tends to confirm that the decision not to offer the unit on February 8 was a commercial one, particularly centring around gas supply considerations.

    "title": "[4th Post] Large and rapid demand drop curtails demand bid for new record in Queensland",
    "date": "13-02-2017 06:27:00 PM",
    "content": "A final post today to follow my first , second and third earlier with a single snapshot from NEM-Watch at 18:10 today – showing two sequential, large drops in Scheduled Demand for Queensland: Drop #1 = around 300MW from 17:15 to 17:25; and Drop #2 = a further 300MW from 17:55 to 18:05. Now there may be a number of reasons why the demand might have dropped in this way – including the following: Reason #1) It might have been demand response either, or both: (a) at large industrial energy users, like some of the ones in Queensland we have been serving for many years; (b) with aggregated small-scale energy users, like those Reposit have been cheering on in recent days. however, as noted on the snapshot, prices have been relatively modest in QLD over the past hour or two, unlike earlier – hence spot-price driven demand response seems unlikely. Reason #2) There are two storm fronts currently passing through South-East Queensland – and this could have affected demand in at least two ways: (a) provided some welcome relief from the heat and humidity, and so toned down air-conditioning usage; and/or (b) caused localised (e.g. lightning-caused) distribution network outages (though 300MW would be a pretty large area). Certainly, as noted, the storms have curtailed earlier than normal the aggregated small-scale PV injection to the grid (given the high penetration rate in South-East Queensland. Reason #3) There’s also a possible reason flagged in the Market Notice, which talks about a “Non-credible contingency event”, which is AEMO code for something happening that they did not consider “credible” (there’s a technical definition of how that is interpreted in the rules). In this case, it was the trip of a couple transmission lines leading into Brisbane – but: (a) as noted in the Market Notice below, no bulk disconnection of load was understood when the notice was issued at 17:36; however (b) the timing of the trip (17:09) does line up reasonably well with the first drop in demand. Hence, Reason #2 seems most likely. Take-away for the day is that the Scheduled Demand has peaked in Queensland at 15:45 up at the 9,330MW level – when measured on a dispatch target basis (hence not a new record).",

    "content": "Another quick note to follow my second (just an hour ago) and my first (from early this morning) to flag a couple prominent developments. Again I have numbered them on the attached snapshot from NEM-Watch at 13:20 this afternoon: 1) Currently the demand (on a Dispatch Target basis) is up at 9,155MW (so easily in excess of prior years, from memory). 2) AEMO’s updated demand forecast has been revised (back) up, for the half-hour ending 17:00 to be 9,538MW – which would definitely be a new record . 3) I’ve also flagged the lower level of Instantaneous Reserve Plant Margin shown for the Queensland Economic Island – now marginally above 10%, with less than 1000MW spare 4) Highlighted in the list of Market Notices is the short-notice transmission outage in Powerlink’s network on a high-voltage piece of the network connecting Tarong to Mt England (i.e. on the way in to Brisbane). This is one of the transmission lines supplying from the South-West into Brisbane. Thankfully there are multiple lines – but an outage on one (which must clearly be needed on a day like today) does reduce the level of redundancy . Here’s the full text: At a very high level, the constraint set invoked will preference generation in the southern part of Queensland over the northern part (e.g. Stanwell, Gladstone and Callide) by virtue of new limitations. 5) As can be seen, solar production has already reached what will probably be peak output this afternoon (at 1,000MW – but 100MW or so lower than yesterday’s peak, presumably because of cloud cover) and will begin the afternoon decline shortly (initially gradual, but then more rapidly to be pretty much all gone by 18:00). Buckle up for the afternoon ride! PS by the time this went live (13:40) the demand was up to 9,201MW and he IRPM down to only 8%",

This is a little lower than the forecast from early this morning – the following chart from Forecast Convergence in ez2view provides a view of what’s been happening with these forecasts on every 30-minute refresh by the AEMO: As can be seen: 1a) There is a fair spread in the forecasts for 17:00 today; and 1b) The actual demand for 12:30 today was actually higher than all prior forecasts – though this does not necessarily carry through to imply the same for 17:00 (it does show, however, how forecasting is a mug’s game – but one the AEMO has to do (and often get bashed for) ). 2) We’re currently running at tight supply/demand balance I’ve noted on the NEM-Watch image above how (at 12:20) we were running with an Instantaneous Reserve Plant Margin of below 15% – a key explanation of why prices are elevated (i.e. it’s a natural market response). 3) AEMO has re-triggered the LOR1 warning for this afternoon Also flagged is the re-triggering of the LOR1 notice this afternoon, which AEMO had cancelled a little earlier in response to its forecasts shifting around a little (we can see the size of the shift in the forecast above). As I explained to someone directly over the past couple days with dramas in SA, NSW and QLD (and less so in VIC), I understand the political sensitivity about these sort of notices – but it would smack of misdirected priorities if Ministers of Energy were to be too nervous about these notices being issued: 3a) It would seem too much like “managing the message” rather than actually fixing the problem of a multi-layered supply/demand crisis in the electricity sector as all these groups have joined together to plead at State and Federal level . 3b) I should not have to be pointing out that the AEMO issues these notices to elicit a market response – a process which actually works quite well, the vast majority of the time (and, when it does not – such as in SA and NSW, it’s not because of the message, or the messenger) . I ask the more seasoned readers to please excuse my profoundly disillusioned view currently – to me currently politicians seem part of the problem, not part of the solution (more on that later, perhaps…)",

I’ve returned now to see this tweet from Powerlink, proclaiming a new all-time record electricity demand at 17:30 (note that their measure is slightly different than that shown in NEM-Watch , for instance): Hence it was with considerable interest that I have now, other jobs completed, had a quick look at how the day panned out in this NEM-Watch snapshot from 20:15 NEM time – which was both well after the Powerlink tweet references, and also later than the 19:30 peak that AEMO had been forecasting this morning: By looking at Scheduled Demand on a “Dispatch Target” basis, like in NEM-Watch , we see that the highest this measure reached today was 9,430MW at 17:25 – which was 47MW below the peak experienced at 17:00 on Wednesday 18th January. I believe the Powerlink measure will differ in two key respects: (a) It will be a Metered Demand, as distinct from a Target; and (b) It will be for a half-hour (as distinct from a 5-minute measure, which will inevitably higher as above). That takes nothing away from the fact that it was a truly astonishing result for the Queensland region on a Sunday (albeit a super-hot one).",

    "title": "About solar panels (predominantly) facing north, not west",
    "date": "11-02-2017 08:35:00 PM",
    "content": "Thank-you to Kane Thornton at the Clean Energy Council for alerting me to this particular article in the Canberra times (so I presume also showing elsewhere) today with this tweet: Alerted by Kane, I read the article and was a bit surprised to see the following quote attributed to me: “At around 5pm, these panels are next to useless ,” Paul McArdle, chief executive of energy software firm, Global-Roam, said. Amongst the many journalists I spoke with on Thursday and Friday, I did speak with Peter Hannam , and I did amongst other things: 1) talk about how solar rapidly declines through the afternoon; and 2) provide my perspective that solar PV has done a great job of reducing peak demand but, because the “duck curve” effect has shifted demand peak later in a summer day, more solar PV (if incentivised the same way – i.e. to maximise kWh harvest) would have diminishing returns ; hence 3) suggested that, if a motivation of adding more solar PV in the future would be to continue to reduce peak demand, thought might need to be given to helping solar developers align panels west (i.e. so these new panels might help more in situations like experienced today and yesterday in NSW) – in addition to, or instead of, just north; 4) of course, a further improvement would be the introduction of battery storage (and we are working to help this happen ), but it is early days in this respect, and there are still a number of challenges to work through in terms of crossed incentives to operate storage at the “optimal” times (however that is defined). However I don’t recall making the specific comment that they would be “next to useless” at any particular time. If I did, then I do apologise as that was not my intent to be derogatory.. As noted earlier today, there is a “glass half-full” and also a “glass half-empty” perspective in terms of solar contributions through these stressful recent days. Both are correct – and just two of a large number of factors that would need to be considered in better managing this energy transition. I hope that, on WattClarity, I have been able to highlight a broad number of them. I do hope that this clarifies my perspective? Of lesser importance, I would highlight three things: 1) Data for how solar did perform through that day: Out of interest, I’ve used NEM-Review to generate the following trend of aggregate solar PV output across Thursday 9th February (a more “normal” day) and yesterday, Friday 10th February – where the system was placed under all sorts of strain. For those who are numerically inclined, I have annotated the solar curve with the aggregate numbers from the AEMO ( historical small-scale solar data from AEMO and not APVI as noted here ). It is also worth pointing out that this data is shown in NEM time , given that it comes from the AEMO – hence 4pm NEM time would represent 5pm Sydney time in daylight savings, and so on… 2) Nothing, in particular “saved NSW” I note Kane’s comment that solar PV “saved NSW” – which is in the same vein as Mark Bailey’s tweet implying that imports from QLD similarly “saved” NSW . As I have noted here and on Twitter in response: 1) every MWh (every kWh) of generation mattered (every kWh of conservation and demand response mattered) in keeping the lights on in NSW; 2) none were any more important than the other; and 3) I can’t see how it helps to single out any particular kWh as particularly special, compared to any other – they all helped (and all were really needed yesterday, and today). For those who particularly want to know, total supply across Friday 11th February in NSW came from: Black coal = 179,724 MWh Gas = 21,203 MWh Liquid fuel = 116 MWh Hydro = 27,369 MWh Solar (small and large) = 8,661 MWh Wind = 6,797 MWh (with this I was pleased to see a better correlation between wind output and peak demand than was the case in South Australia on Wednesday ). plus imports from QLD and VIC that I have not taken the time to add up. 3) NSW was not really “saved” yesterday in any case Yes, I understand that it could easily have been a lot worse – and for that we can be grateful to all the hardworking people across all parts of the industry who toiled to ensure that was not the case. However I certainly don’t think NSW was “saved” – my perspective is that it was a dire situation that could have been calamitous . Friday was a sign of energy-sector failure, not success. I’m pretty sure that the people at Tomago aluminium smelter, who could also think they “saved” NSW because of their large-scale demand response certainly won’t be feeling like they were saved these past few days, for instance. This is just another example of an energy supply sector in crisis – wouldn’t it be better if we all just knuckled down, put the parochialism to one side, and worked out how to make this energy transition work properly?",

    "content": "Following my first post at 12:25 NEM time we see that demand has continued to climb in NSW as the heatwave continues, and as shown in the following snapshot from NEM-Watch at 14:55 NEM time (so 15:55 Market Time): As noted, demand is climbing up into the red zone today. Because of a question asked on twitter about today’s earlier post, I have powered up NEM-Review v6 to run this longer-term query of the maximum demand levels seen in NSW over all Saturdays since January 1999 – producing the following trend: As is clear from this trend, it’s been 6 years since we have seen anything like this level of peak demand – which (as others have noted) should have been expected at some point (given ongoing population growth, etc) but is still noteworthy given the list of factors that had been working to suppress demand over the interim period . Of particular interest to many, we know, is how solar PV is contributing – hence I’ve extracted this current chart from NEM-Watch highlighting both small-scale rooftop PV (estimated aggregate data from the APVI) and metered data for large-scale plant. For us, this chart really sums up the “glass half-empty, glass half-full” conundrum relating to solar PV and peak demand , especially on days like today. Worth highlighting the much more rapid decline in small-scale solar output (aggregated across NSW) compared to the few large scale plant, which seem to be much better at holding output high for longer. Perhaps one of our learned readers can provide a comment below to help me understand why? As could be (quite sadly) predicted, I see our friends at Tomago Aluminium smelter are going to be asked to turn down consumption, as they did yesterday to contribute to the effort of avoiding more wide-spread load shedding (or unstable system collapse). I’m sure a pretty unwanted, and unwelcome, form of demand response (but, by the magnitude of the reduction reported, indicative of the huge size of the crisis that the energy supply sector finds itself in ). Here’s the article at the ABC linked in the tweet above, and here is coverage on the Age .

    "content": "Following the dramas of the white knuckle ride yesterday in NSW (and, in reality, through the rest of the interconnected NEM as well), it’s worth noting that we’re not yet out of the woods – as shown in the following snapshot from NEM-Watch at 12:25 NEM time (so 13:25 Sydney daylight savings time) in Sydney: As noted in the annotations, NSW Scheduled Demand for the 12:35 dispatch interval is 12,493MW and rapidly steaming up to an forecast peak of 13,853MW in the 17:00 Trading Period (which would be less than 1,000MW off the all-time record, so itself remarkable for a stinking hot Saturday). Also noted is the two Market Notices issued at 12:19 by the AEMO flagging that the supply/demand balance is already tight – the text of the forecast LOR2 is included below for your ease of reference: So, once again, we have a very tight situation forecast for the afternoon – as Scheduled Demand increases coincident with the accelerating afternoon decline of solar PV injections . As shown in the NEM-Watch image for 12:35, the Instantaneous Reserve Plant Margin at that time was down to 17% (which itself is a fairly healthy level – but forecast to drop further through the afternoon). This is calculated as surplus of the 13,013MW of local generation capacity bid available at the time supplying the 11,130MW of demand in the NSW “Economic Island”. Those with a numerical inclination will note that this number (11,130MW) is less than the NSW Scheduled Demand for the period. This is the case because of power being supplied from VIC and QLD. Now this is a natural part of a well-functioning, interconnected electricity grid/market – it happens each and every day, every five minutes of the day. But do we really need our elected representatives to be investing the time to highlight this trivia (as if Mark Bailey had personally toiled to haul all those MWh over the border to NSW yesterday in a wheelbarrow)? Every MWh (every kWh) delivered yesterday, and conserved yesterday, counted – and counted equally – just as it will today . Why single out any particular contribution like it was “the golden child” – as Mark has done above, or as Amy did below: With the electricity supply industry in crisis (many stark examples since July 2016) we should be expecting more from our elected representatives. It’s not about coal, and it’s not about renewables either (in fact my sense is that the Emotion-o-Meter is subverting reason) – but more on that later…",

    "date": "10-02-2017 06:36:00 AM",
    "content": "A quick update on yesterday’s post at 06:10 and update in the early afternoon relating to the AEMO’s forecasts for today in the NSW region of what really has become the “pressure cooker” of the National Electricity Market: 1) In an environment where searing temperatures will test all manner of equipment (physical and mental), and set air-conditioning units boiling; 2) Where politicians have devolved to all manner of puerile name-calling and finger-pointing, but with not one accepting any share of responsibility for the mess we find ourselves in (when, in reality, they are all just as much at fault). Here’s a snapshot from NEM-Watch at 06:15 NEM Time (so 07:10 in Sydney under daylight savings) showing an expected peak in Scheduled Demand up at 14,584MW at 16:30. This would be very close to eclipsing the prior record of 14,649MW measured on a dispatch target basis experienced back in February 2011 and documented here at the time : Were it to eventuate this would be a remarkable outcome given this list of factors that has been working to suppress Scheduled Demand since around 2009. Two key ones here: 1) At the large-scale end, there was the closure of Kurri Kurri aluminium smelter which removed several hundred megawatts of base-load consumption from the demand stack; and 2) At the small-scale end, the growth of solar PV saw yesterday total injections in NSW behind the meter (hence netting off Scheduled Demand) estimated to be 800MW. Also highlighted on the snapshot is AEMO’s warnings of a shortage of reserves for NSW tomorrow (Saturday 11th February) and also a tight supply/demand balance for QLD today. For those who are interested, they can key an eye on how temperatures are influencing electricity consumption in NSW (and also the other regions of the NEM, and in the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) in WA in the NEM-Watch Consumption Widget located a number of places, including: 1) On the Energy Consumer’s Australia website here (our sponsor for this widget); and 2) On our NEM-Watch Website here (with an explanation, underneath, of what you’re looking at).

    "title": "Initial Analysis: SA Load Shedding Wed 8 Feb 2017",
    "date": "09-02-2017 12:31:00 PM",
    "content": "Gigabytes of bandwidth and acres of digital newsprint may well be devoted to arguing the ultimate reasons behind yet another blackout – albeit only partial – in South Australia yesterday evening: In this analysis I’ll stick to the immediate causes apparent so far in the market data. Whilst prices did of course spike to $13,000-$14,000/MWh for over 2 hours, including the duration of the load shedding (when the spot price is automatically set to the Market Price Cap ), this post will focus on the supply / demand balance we saw yesterday. This, rather than bidding behaviour or other factors, was the key driver of both the load shedding and the extreme prices. I’ll start with an analysis of the demand and supply situation around the time of the load shedding, then some observations on how the day evolved. Extreme heat drove SA demand to very high levels Adelaide endured a maximum temperature of over 42 degrees and some inland locations saw readings exceeding 46 degrees. This pushed scheduled demand well above this summer’s previous highs, approaching 3,100 MW , seen here along with dispatch price and (local) generation availability over the period 12:00pm – 10:00pm AEST in this screenshot from ez2view ’s Time Series Data Viewer tool: This demand level corresponds to AEMO’s “P10” maximum half hourly demand forecast for South Australia in the most recent National Electricity Forecasting Report – meaning a forecast expected to be exceeded only one year in ten. Demand last exceeded this level in January 2014 (and reached levels over 3,300 MW in 2009 and 2011), however AEMO’s forecasts have predicted declining maximum demands due to assumptions of increasing PV penetration, energy efficiency, and changes in South Australia’s economy. An observation from this chart is that it shows a demand drop of about 300 MW during the load shedding period compared to the 100 MW figure quoted in AEMO’s media release – the reasons for the difference are unclear. South Australian Supply The green line on the chart above shows available generation in South Australia on Wednesday afternoon / evening. Three features are immediately obvious: The line moves around substantially (isn’t generation capacity more or less fixed?); It declines through the afternoon peak whilst demand is climbing (why?); and There is a large gap between local generation capacity and demand throughout the afternoon peak (what fills this gap?) The answer to the first two questions is that “available generation” reflects maximum output that can be physically produced given real time wind and temperature conditions . With a large fleet of wind generators in South Australia, falling wind speeds on a hot, still summer afternoon meant less maximum output from those windfarms. To a lesser extent, very high temperatures also degrade the maximum output capability of most forms of generation, particularly gas turbines, and a smaller part of the decline is due to this effect. The gap between local supply and demand is met from the two interconnectors linking SA to Victoria and the rest of the NEM – the Heywood AC interconnection capable of securely flowing around 600 MW into SA, and the Murraylink DC interconnector , which has nominal capacity of 220 MW. The following chart breaks down the contributions of thermal generation (gas and liquid fuel fired), interconnector imports , and windfarms to South Australian supply yesterday: This highlights the output from wind generation falling away into the afternoon and the increasing contribution from local thermal generation. Combined interconnector imports were relatively constant through the afternoon. So why the load shedding? The quick answer is that by 6pm AEST (6:30pm Adelaide daylight saving time), all online, available local generation sources in South Australia, wind and thermal, were producing their maximum available output for the conditions. More interconnector imports were needed to fill the increasing demand-to-generation gap shown in the earlier chart, and – on the Murraylink interconnector – had exceeded levels consistent with keeping the power system in a secure state . We can see this in the following snapshot from ez2view showing the South Australian region for dispatch interval 18:05 (the five minute period 18:00 – 18:05). I’ve enlarged the icon showing target flows (197 MW) on Murraylink and, in the very small font underneath, limits on these flows – the relevant one is the left hand import limit of 78 MW, which is being exceeded by over 100 MW . In fact this situation of Murraylink flows exceeding limits had pertained for about 30 minutes preceding this snapshot. These limits do not reflect the physical interconnector capacity (220 MW) but are the output of system constraints designed to keep the power system in a secure operating state . Outside the bounds of these constraints, a single contingency such as a line or generator trip, could possibly result in damage to equipment, risks to safety, and in the worst case a widespread blackout. Broadly, AEMO has an obligation to return the power system to a secure operating state within 30 minutes. The only reason flows on the Murraylink interconnector would have exceeded the relevant import limit in the first place is that no further generation supply was available for dispatch in South Australia at this time – AEMO’s dispatch process will fully utilise all available generation resources before scheduling such constraint violations . With demand continuing to rise, no further local generation able to be dispatched, and interconnector flows beyond secure levels , AEMO instructed SA Power Networks – the local distributor for South Australia – to begin rolling load shedding. Generation Analysis – Why did supply fall short? I’ve prepared the following table comparing actual generator outputs at 6pm AEST yesterday – a fair reflection of their maximum capability at the time of load shedding – with the nominal summer capacities of each power station in South Australia, broken into Thermal and Wind groups, as well as nominal interconnector capacities (but note the comments above on the impact of constraints): Notes to the table indicate where specific thermal stations had output materially below capacity due to unit outages . Thermal stations as a group produced to about 89% of their nominal summer capacity. The largest outages being one unit ( 120 MW ) at Torrens Island Power Station and the Port Lincoln Gas Turbines ( 56MW ) being offline, the latter reportedly due to transmission issues. The other, long term, outage noted above – and not counted towards nominal capacity for yesterday – is the withdrawal of one unit at the Pelican Point gas fired power station from regular service since March 2015. This unit is not available for immediate dispatch – according to this AEMO document : “ ENGIE has advised that half of the Pelican Point Power Station capacity (239 MW) can be assumed to remain out of service …, and that the full power station capacity could be made available within three months, subject to the commercial viability of returning the unit to service ” Update Thurs 9 Feb: This afternoon we have seen AEMO issue a Direction to a South Australian market participant following declaration of a Lack of Reserve 2 (LOR2) event, and from 15:55 AEST generation at Pelican Point ramping up to around 320 MW, which would be consistent with startup of the “withdrawn” unit. Furthermore comments attributed to AEMO in this media article imply that with early enough notice on the day, startup of this unit might have been achievable on Wednesday – contrary to the statement above. As an inherently variable supply source, the nominal capacity of wind generation is less relevant than the proportion of that capacity that can be “conservatively” assumed to be available at times of peak demand. AEMO use an assumption of 9.4% in their system reliability studies, and at 5.7% yesterday, wind output was about 55MW lower than this level. As noted earlier, flows on the Murraylink interconnector were within physical capacity, but in excess of constraint limits . Overall, this analysis indicates overall available supply capable of supporting demands up to about 3,000 MW under the conditions ruling yesterday. Hence as demand approached the 3,100 MW level, AEMO ordered planned load shedding to reduce demand and thus maintain secure system operation. What could be seen earlier in the day? Yesterday’s events caught many by surprise (certainly this observer, exhibit A being I produced a quick post mid-afternoon on Wednesday focussing on the outlook for Thursday 9 Feb and ignoring the outlook for the rest of Wednesday afternoon). Those events were a very unpleasant surprise for South Australians left without power during the peak of the late afternoon heat. Full discussion of “who should have done what, when?” is not appropriate for this early post, I’ll just use the extent of the demand surprise lurking in AEMO’s on-the-day predispatch forecasts to illustrate the difficulties in predicting even the short term future of the market. This chart, based on ez2view ’s Forecast Convergence tool shows how AEMO’s predispatch forecasts evolved through the day – to partly reduce clutter not all these forecasts, which are updated half hourly, are shown: Actual demands continued to climb well above successive predispatch forecasts, which never came close to keeping up. Even the forecasts produced relatively late in the afternoon did not show demand approaching the 3,000 MW level discussed above. For a second, numerical view of this data, we can use the Forecast Convergence tool’s “Grid” view: Each column on this is for a specific half hour of the day. Each row represents a forecast of half hourly demands out for the balance of the day (latest forecast at the top), with actual values showing on the diagonal. Reading the chart up each column shows how the forecasts for that half hour evolved over the day. Summary and Conclusions South Australia effectively “ran out” of secure power supplies due to extreme heat pushing demand to levels beyond that supportable, given wind and system conditions on the day Rolling controlled load shedding over a period of ~1 hour was used as the last option to keep system supply and demand balanced in a secure operating state The performance of those generators available on the day, including windfarms, and interconnections, was probably generally consistent with pre-summer planning assumptions Even on-the-day forecasts struggled to envisage the size of the demand peak ultimately reached, However, given the limitations on supply available at the time, more accurate on the day forecasts may not have changed the ultimate outcome. Update 9 Feb The increased output seen on Thursday afternoon from Pelican Point and statements attributed to AEMO may possibly mean that this station’s second unit could, with sufficient notice, have been brought back into service by Wednesday afternoon had the need been more clearly foreseen earlier – although what lead time would have been necessary is uncertain.. This may – stress may – have obviated the need for load shedding.

    "content": "It’s deja-vu all over again in South Australia this evening (Wed 8th February). Following on from both: 1) The massive state-wide blackout on 28th September 2016 ; and 2) the smaller interruption that occurred on 1st December ; 3) we see load shedding again . Here’s a quick view of the whole of the NEM through NEM-Watch this evening at 19:30 NEM time (so 20:00 in Adelaide under daylight savings): That’s not a misprint – it is reading a 1% instantaneous reserve plant margin (or only 26MW of spare capacity declared available for the 19:30 dispatch interval). That’s ludicrous. As noted in the snapshot, gas-fired generation is supplying the lion’s share, with the liquid fuelled plants kicking in a bit, and wind doing what it can (albeit in the doldrums on a stinking hot day). Solar’s also faded into night. Thankfully, this time, the interconnections have held up.

    "title": "The ‘other’ factors driving price volatility in the NEM",
    "date": "08-02-2017 12:10:00 PM",
    "content": "One of the more recent developments we’ve observed in the NEM is the downward trend in gas powered generation, raising concerns as to whether there is more pain to come for east coast industrial consumers. But there are other trends that are creating risks for large energy users. This article steps through these additional influencing factors. Gas fired generation for the east coast market is declining Figure 1 shows a clear recent declining trend in natural gas generation across all jurisdictions. What we see are gas fired generators choosing the most attractive return on limited gas resources. With the exception of events in Tasmania arising from the failure of the Basslink interconnector for all Q1 2016, most jurisdictions registered record low seasonal generation, particularly during Q4 2016 where the approaching summer peak demand was met by hydro generation. Unprecedented domestic summer gas prices during Q4 2016 also led to the curtailment of gas generation. Figure 1: NEM total gas generation (MWh) by region and Volume Weighted Average Spot Gas Price ($/GJ) by month With gas price forecasts rising off continued tightening of the domestic gas market, combined with the announced withdrawal or curtailment of some larger gas fired generation assets, which have traditionally provided both baseload and additional peaking capacity, clients must carefully assess their price risk exposure. Risks could increase with any delays in procurement if using a traditional all-at-once fixed price and time approach. Volatility (not just prices) in the futures markets is trending up – are we seeing increasing perceived risks for retailers? The figure below plots the ‘Bollinger bands’ of the price of the exchange traded futures contracts for FY18 in NSW. This analysis shows the two standard deviations away from the 21-day simple moving average. Because standard deviation is a measure of volatility, when the markets become more volatile, the bands widen; during less volatile periods, the bands contract. Figure 2: Bollinger bands volatility indicator – NSW FY18 Futures Contracts The significant increase in price volatility, experienced in the futures markets across all NEM jurisdictions (not just NSW) over the last few months, should lead to an increased focus on the development of an electricity sourcing strategy that aims to at least partially hedge this price volatility, and a contracting approach to reduce your retailer’s risk premium. Liquidity on exchange traded volume is trending down – is there less market transparency? The following graph is plotting the total volume in ASX Energy futures exchange market year-on-year by NEM jurisdictions over the last 10 years as well as the total face value of the futures contracts. In the 2005 to 2012 period these trading volumes have been increasing despite the vertical integration of generators and retailers, which tends to decrease the volume of traded derivatives, as hedging is undertaken within an organisation. Over the last three years the volume of forward contracts negotiated via the futures exchange has decreased. This type of contract represents a small proportion of the total trades and it seems that this proportion is declining. There are likely more over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, with forward contracts directly negotiated between retailers and generators, and not through the Exchange. Another possible explanation is that with increasing spot-market price and volatility, generators may decide to reduce the proportion of their generation capacity that is forward contracted. The generators’ motivation for forward contracts is to hedge their risk if the spot-market price is too low and firm up their forward income stream. With high spot-market prices, the risk hedging is less prevalent and keeping part of the books open, allows the generators’ trading desk to generate more profit from short term trades. If this trend is confirmed, we can expect less transparency on retail contract pricing and increasing risk of spot volatility. With increasing correlation between gas and electricity markets, a continued tightening of the domestic gas market, increased price volatility and decreased liquidity on the exchange traded electricity derivatives, Energetics can advise on the most appropriate hedging strategies with appropriate trade-offs between flexibility in forward purchasing and capping your energy budget risk.

    "title": "Overview: NSW & Qld Price Volatility, Monday 6 Feb 2017",
    "date": "07-02-2017 10:40:00 AM",
    "content": "With the people of New South Wales facing yet another day of extreme heat, following a sweltering weekend, the likelihood of spot price volatility was always going to be high yesterday. Predispatch forecasts through the morning showed the possibility of a couple of hours of prices close to the Market Price Cap (MPC) of $14,000/MWh through the late afternoon peak demand period, as seen here in ez2view ’s Summary Trends chart for NSW, “time travelled” to show the outlook at 9am AEST: The outlook for Queensland, where summer heat and demand have just been uniformly strong, was for at least as much volatility: On a day with high demands in NSW as well as in Queensland, these two NEM regions are very likely to exhibit strongly correlated spot price behaviour , because: with two relatively high capacity and reliable interconnectors from adjoining states (the QNI link from Queensland and the Victorian interconnector), on days of high demand NSW typically relies on significant imports from both regions – this is evident in the first chart above which shows only a relatively small margin at the peak between demand (the darker grey area) and local generation availability (the lighter grey area). This narrow margin is supplemented by the capability of QNI (about 800-1000 MW southward capacity), and the Victorian link, although available capacity on the latter depends strongly on system conditions – as discussed in an earlier post . With Queensland demand also high, it is unlikely however that there will be so much “excess” low cost generation available in that state that the QNI link will actually constrain southward flows – after which the NSW spot price could move significantly higher than Queensland’s as AEMO needed to dispatch additional NSW generation to meet demand increases. Instead we are quite likely to see closely related prices in the two regions, with southward flows on QNI less than the full capacity of the interconnector. By contrast, with subdued demands and plenty of spare generation in Victoria, northward flows in the Vic-NSW interconnector are much more likely to hit that interconnection’s export limits , resulting in significantly lower prices south of the border. We can see these effects already operating at 09:00 in ez2view ’s NEM Overview Map : We’ve also seen many situations this summer when NSW has not faced extreme demands and the (much smaller) northward capability of the QNI interconnector has constrained flows from NSW into Queensland , leading to price spikes being isolated to Queensland, for example this one from Jan 27 : This feature of NSW and Queensland effectively operating as one large “Northern NEM” region yesterday is the key theme I wanted to draw attention to in this post, rather than a detailed investigation of the price spikes themselves, which would be a much longer story. Skipping to the actual outcome of the day, I’ve plotted up NSW and Queensland 5 minute dispatch interval ( DI ) level prices and demands using ez2view ’s ez2trend Time Series Data Viewer widget (still under development): Here we see that: NSW and Queensland prices indeed moved closely together throughout the day; While significant, the volatility was less extended than earlier forecast in pre-dispatch (even though we didn’t appear to see previous levels of voluntary demand response in reaction to actual or threatened high prices, which can damp volatility ). Investigating the second point further would require more time and space than this post allows, but I’ll provide one more picture that may provide a clue as to why this was the case, via an ez2view NEM Overview snapshot, time travelled back to DI 16:45 which was just prior to the main block of volatility in the chart above: I’ve highlighted the level of Queensland generation above which is well into the mid-9000 MW level, given local scheduled demand of 8,840 MW and exports of nearly 500 MW south on the QNI and Directlink interconnectors. However the dispatch price of only $68.24/MWh must mean at least 9,400-odd MW of Queensland generation capacity was being offered at or below this price. We’ve frequently seen the bidstack in Queensland this summer such that 5 digit prices occur at significantly lower levels of generation dispatch (see here and here for examples). Why was yesterday different? One possible reason – although I’m speculating – is that some Queensland generators had sold (financial) contracts to hedge counterparties against the NSW spot price in addition to their “natural” position of hedging the Queensland price. In these circumstances, if prices in both regions move together like yesterday, those generators would have a strong financial incentive to offer more volume at low prices – to ensure being dispatched – than they might on days when the NSW spot price was not likely to spike.

    "title": "Overview: Queensland volatility 1-2 Feb 2017",
    "date": "03-02-2017 02:00:00 PM",
    "content": "A very volatile couple of days in Queensland on Wednesday and Thursday this week, with respectively 12 and 20 dispatch interval (5 minute) prices exceeding $1,000/MWh, and average daily prices of $406/MWh and $781/MWh. It’s not our intention in these occasional reviews to cover every high price event, nor drill as deeply into their detail as in a couple of earlier posts , and in general we saw continuation of the underlying themes of strong, weather driven demand and a thin bidstack (little generator volume offered in the broad price range $300 – $10,000+ per megawatt-hour). So here I’ll just focus on one overall observation about Queensland that’s been evident from the last couple of days. The demand side vs the supply side There were pretty clear signs on both days of demand response triggered by either actual or threatened dispatch price spikes, battling with supply side pressures for volatility. On this chart for Wednesday, I’ve plotted actual metered demands versus dispatch price , and highlighted in red downward demand movements in excess of 100 MW in 5 minutes: Other than later in the evening when demand naturally falls away rapidly, it’s clear that nearly all these demand falls happen immediately after or just before a price spike. Even that second fall (at 3:10pm) that doesn’t appear to be associated with a spike, actually is. Using ez2view ’s Time Travel function to capture the market “pre-dispatch” outlook at 3:05pm: – we can see that there was in fact a spike forecast at nearly $13,500/MWh within the current half hour trading interval. Almost certainly this outook led to price responsive load taking preemptive action by reducing demand as seen on the initial chart (such preemptive action makes sense because of the 5/30 issue discussed in an earlier post , as well as previously on WattClarity ). This in turn was enough to prevent the spike actually occurring. That same predispatch forecast also shows the potential for very high prices on the following day, and this is what we got: The main differences here are what looks like a larger amount of demand response early in the day, and then its apparent absence during the main part of the afternoon peak in demand between 4pm and 6pm, including nine consecutive dispatch periods from 4:50pm where prices were at $12,499-$13,400/MWh . The reasons for this aren’t clear, and as voluntary demand-side response is not scheduled by nor visible to AEMO in the same way as supply side offers and dispatch are, and therefore no detailed data becomes public during or after the event, we can’t do more than speculate. It’s possible that there actually was some load withdrawn right through this period. If so, this would have kept demand lower than it otherwise would have been, but clearly not by enough to stop prices breaking through to 5 digit levels once demands were solidly above the 9,000 MW level..

    "title": "Initial Review: NEM-wide Price Event, Monday 30 Jan 2017",
    "date": "31-01-2017 02:25:00 PM",
    "content": "At 4:45pm AEST yesterday, the start of dispatch interval (DI) 16:50, spot prices suddenly spiked in the three largest NEM states, viewed here on ez2view ’s NEM Overview Map widget: Those high prices lasted for just that single DI, and 10 minutes later we saw this picture: By the next DI, things were back close to normal, which is more or less where they stayed for the rest of the evening: So what was that all about? Unfortunately a full answer would be complicated and time consuming – both to investigate and then to explain. The NEM can be a very complex animal. In this review I’ll just try to touch on some key factors, which in summary seem to be the following: Brutally hot weather in NSW – approaching 44 degrees in western Sydney – driving demand to very high levels . Queensland demand was also strong. Transmission constraints limiting the ability of Victorian generation to flow northwards into NSW to help meet those high demands. In particular the NEM’s own unique version of the rail gauge problem reared its head. Bidding behaviour also contributed NSW Demand 5 minute scheduled demands in NSW exceeded 14,000 MW around the late afternoon / evening peak and even half hourly averages – AEMO’s customary Maximum Demand metric – approached that level, which hasn’t been seen since the summer of 2010/11 Fortunately all the major thermal power stations in NSW were available and running at near full capacity, but even with about 14,600 MW total of local generating capacity available, interconnector imports – especially from Victoria where demands were subdued leaving plenty of spare generation capacity – were important in generally keeping a lid on spot prices through the day. Transmission Constraints Constraints on power flows within and between NEM regions, to maintain secure operation of the network, are a crucial feature of the NEM. Interconnector constraints which limit flows between NEM regions are a well known example, and most readers will be familiar with seeing price separation between regions when no additional power can securely flow from a lower-priced region to a neighbouring high-price region. Less well known is that many if not most of these “interconnector constraints” aren’t actually anything to do with the transmission lines that physically cross NEM regional boundaries, but with equipment and conditions elsewhere in the network. And that’s where the rail gauge analogy comes in, because one of the key constraints operating yesterday originates from the fact that back when the Victorian and NSW power systems were run by separate state-owned entities (dare I say “fiefdoms”?), they decided to standardise their highest capacity transmission lines at that time on different voltage levels – 500 kilovolts (kV) in Victoria and 330 kV in NSW. The end result was that the key lines between NSW and Victoria, built in the days of the Snowy Scheme’s construction, still operate at 330 kV but within Victoria most large generation is nowadays connected to 500 kV lines (and the rest at 220 kV). So moving power from Victoria to NSW requires 500kV/330kV transformers, actually located at South Morang near Melbourne, and these can be a crucial bottleneck on northward flows . On the first couple of screenshots above, the flows from Victoria to NSW are constrained at around 650-700 MW, and were limited by this South Morang transformer capacity constraint. The 330kV transmission lines linking Victoria and NSW can themselves carry considerably more power than this. All this meant that AEMO’s dispatch process was limited in its ability to use “low cost” generation in the southern part of the NEM to supply demand in NSW or Queensland. Bidding Behaviour Generator rebids, together with some tightening on the Vic-NSW interconnector limit (which moves around dynamically as network conditions change), may have been the final trigger for the event at DI 16:50, since there were no major changes to demand, generation trips etc in the northern regions. Looking, the day after the event, at ez2view ’s Region Schematic widget for NSW , we see evidence of a couple of rebids that moved low-priced capacity to high-price bands just before the spike. In DI 16:40 The important rebid here is from Tumut 3, indicated by the circled ‘$’ symbol. A summary of this rebid appears in ez2view when hovering over the symbol: The last two lines show that 100 MW of capacity has been repriced from $299.80/MWh (which happens to be the NSW dispatch price for this DI) to $13,999/MWh. Then in DI 16:50 itself, a rebid at Upper Tumut, moving a bit more capacity (80MW) to high price bands: With the constrained flows from the south dropping a little, these rebids and the limited spare, lower priced capacity available in Queensland and NSW being fully utilised then left the spot price in the northern regions with nowhere to go but five-digit territory . As for reasons why the price in Victoria also leapt to over $5,000/MWh at the same time, and the SA price jumped, less dramatically, to over $500/MWh – well, these are very complex but have to do with the detailed operation of the very same transmission constraint limiting flows into NSW from the south. I’m unable to go into the details here, but very roughly, high prices in NSW/Qld can “echo back” into other NEM regions due to the mathematics underlying the way this constraint and others operate, and the way dispatch price is determined. ez2view ’s Price Setter Data widget shows which bids at which NEM unit or units are effectively setting each regional price and for the 16:50 DI it shows very high price bids at Oakey power station in Queensland are not only setting price in NSW and Queensland (effectively one region under yesterday’s conditions) but also contributing to prices in all mainland NEM regions : Finally and very briefly, the cause of those subsequent –$1,000/MWh prices comes down to the same reason cited in an earlier review – after a price spike, generators can be strongly incentivised to rebid more capacity at low prices in an attempt to increase their output, because of the “ 5/30 ” settlement price effect . They did this in spades after the 16:50 price spike yesterday resulting in that brief drop in dispatch price to the market floor in the south of the NEM, and close to zero in NSW and Queensland.

    "title": "Quick Review: $13,800/MWh Queensland spike Mon Jan 30",
    "date": "31-01-2017 09:40:00 AM",
    "content": "(Prepared on the day; I won’t have a chance to further review this event on Tuesday after bid data is published) Another day, another isolated 5 minute spike in Queensland, falling in DI 06:50: The underlying causes are very likely similar to those we saw in last Friday’s spike , although today we didn’t see rapidly increasing generation, reversing interconnector flows and negative settlement residues, because the spike arrived relatively late in the half hour. However we did again see some immediate reduction in demand probably associated with price-responsive loads. Quickly reviewing 5 minute actual data in ez2view ’s Swim Lanes widget, time-travelled a few periods beyond the spike, we can draw some early conclusions on cause: DI 06:50 was the only period where flows on the interconnectors from NSW hit their limits, allowing the Queensland price to separate from NSW. This likely forced the dispatch of high-price bid bands in Queensland – the thin bidstack effect seen throughout this summer . There may also have been some generator rebids just prior to the 06:50 dispatch interval, leading to higher interconnector flows and price separation. We can get a hint of this before the next day’s publication of bid data by comparing metered actual generation output levels around the time of the price spike, using ez2view ’s Schematic widget time travelled to adjoining dispatch intervals. I’ve highlighted the noticeable changes: We see output at some coal fired generators reducing despite the higher dispatch price while output increases at a number of gas fired units (we see these changes in the next dispatch interval following the spike – DI 06:55 being the five minute period 06:50-06:55 – as the start time of this interval is when these actual output data are captured and published by AEMO’s systems). It’s therefore likely that the spike was at least partially due to rebids on some of those coal-fired generation units lowering their output and causing high priced generation offers to be dispatched after the interconnectors constrained. Tuesday’s bid data will show if I was right.

    "title": "Initial Review: $14,000/MWh Spike in Qld, Fri 27 Jan 2017",
    "date": "29-01-2017 07:58:00 PM",
    "content": "One of Paul McArdle’s Twitter connections (no relation to your guest author!) posed this question about the $14,000/MWh Queensland price spike last Friday, in dispatch interval (DI) 10:35am: In this first of what will be an ongoing series of event reviews in the NEM, I’ll do my best to give a quick(ish) reply. But as this is a first post, I’ll give both a quick and a more extended answer, illustrating one approach to reviewing market events like this in more detail. Don’t worry, future posts will be considerably shorter! The Quick Version Just before the spike, although there were no concrete forecasts of such extreme prices in Queensland, there were a number of warning signals: there had been a couple of earlier jabs to just over $1,400/MWh, demands were running above forecast, interconnector flows from NSW into Queensland were constrained, and overall we have seen a volatile spot market in Queensland this summer reflecting a very “thin” generation bidstack ( see Paul’s forensic WattClarity post on “Sizzling Saturday” 14th of January for a wealth of detail on this ). At DI 10:35, this all converged to a smallish rise in 5 minute Queensland demand leading to a very large jump in dispatch price from $98.94/MWh to $14,000/MWh, as lower price generation offers were fully utilised and AEMO had to dispatch very high priced Queensland generation offers to meet demand – but this did not mean that Queensland was anywhere near running out of generation capacity – just that a relatively large amount of that capacity was offered only at very high prices. And that “negative residue” on the NSW-Qld interconnector mentioned in Mitch’s tweet? Well that reflects behaviour immediately after the spike. DI 10:35 is the first 5 minute dispatch interval in the half hour Trading (Settlement) Interval covering 10:30 – 11:00. Financial settlement prices in the NEM are the half hourly average of the six 5-minute dispatch prices in each half hour, so a $14,000 price in the first DI guarantees a settlement price of at least $1,500/MWh (1) . All generation dispatched anytime during the half hour earns that settlement price, so generators had a strong financial incentive to increase volumes in the next 25 minutes (2) , by offering more capacity at lower prices. This is an example of the much discussed “ 5/30 ” issue, covered previously here on WattClarity . In the event, that’s what happened – Queensland generators rebid to lower price bands, increasing local generation and reversing flows on the QNI and DirectLink interconnectors in the rest of the half hour, resulting in an net southwards flow of energy. But that single $14,000/MWh price in Queensland for the first 5 minutes meant that for 10:30-11:00 as a whole, the Queensland and NSW half hourly settlement prices – on which interconnector residue payments are also calculated, another artefact of the 5/30 issue – were counter to the net flow direction, with power flowing from the high price ($2,353.04/MWh) Queensland region into the low price ($49.65/MWh) NSW region. Effectively, the NEM “bought” high price Queensland energy and “sold” it for low prices in NSW. “Negative Residue” is just a technical term for “losing money” on these counter price interconnector flows! Footnotes (1) That $1,500/MWh minimum would only occur if the next 5 DI prices were all at the market floor price of negative $1,000/MWh. In practice we’d usually expect a half hourly average of over $2,000/MWh. (2) And price-responsive loads would similarly have a strong incentive to reduce their demand over the rest of the half-hour The Extended Answer Let’s start by reviewing the market conditions and outlook a short time beforehand, using the Time Travel function in global-roam’s ez2view market analysis tool. I’ve wound the clock back to DI 10:25am. Here are the graphical trends – actuals and pre-dispatch forecasts – for price, demand, and generator availability as seen in ez2view: We can see there were a couple of earlier five minute spikes to around $1,200/MWh (price is the dark line on this chart), however the immediate outlook for dispatch prices doesn’t show anything much over $300/MWh. Generation availability (the lighter grey area) is comfortably above demand. But one thing to note here is the apparent drop in demand (the darker grey area series) about one hour ahead, which I’ve circled on the chart. This point is where AEMO’s on-the-day demand forecasts cut over from “P5” (5 minute) to “P30” (half hourly) granularity, and are produced by two slightly different processes. The fact that the P5 version is running significantly above the P30 (by about 200MW) is a tell-tale sign that actual demands are turning out to be higher than forecast earlier in the day. This is one early warning sign that there could be price risk on the upside. (No space to go further into this here, but ez2view ’s Forecast Convergence widget is a very useful tool for looking more more deeply into how forecasts and actuals for key measures like price and demand evolved for any given day or period.) Stepping one interval forward in ez2view to DI 10:30, not much changes. This time I’ll show the numerical values for price, demand and a few other items using ez2view ’s Swim Lanes widget, a useful and flexible tool for viewing a wide variety of NEM data in tabular format: The first few rows here give a quick overview of what’s happening in the Queensland region and the two interconnectors linking it to NSW: 5 minute actual prices sitting around the $100/MWh mark but forecast to go into the $300/MWh range from DI 10:35 onwards, actual demands bumping around the mid 7600MW – low 7700MW range and forecast to stay above 7700 MW in the near term, and “Dispatched Generation” – ie the amount of Queensland generation dispatched by AEMO – moving out of the mid 7400 MW range and into the low 7500 MW range The reason Dispatched Generation is less than demand is explained by the next couple of bands in the table, showing the flows and limits on the QNI (“NSW1-QLD1”) and DirectLink (“N-Q-MNSP1”) interconnectors. Around 200 MW of power is flowing from NSW into Queensland on these links, but the fact that flows are up at their respective limit values means that both links are constrained . Any further increases in demand can only be met from local generation, and Queensland prices are liable to separate from those in NSW and the rest of the NEM. This is another warning sign for potential price volatility in Queensland. Rolling forward to DI 10:35 and – bang (shown on ez2view ’s NEM Overview Map): The Swim Lanes view for 10:35 shows that 5 minute scheduled demand, 7745MW, has actually jumped a little bit higher than was forecast in the previous P5 run (7715 MW, per the earlier Swim Lanes screenshot above) But why did a relatively small move in demand lead to such a large change in the Queensland price? To conclusively answer this we need to open up ez2view ’s Current Bids widget and see what the Queensland generation bidstack was showing (note that we can only access this bid data next day, it is not published live): Here are the bids for DI 10:30: I’ve sorted the bids in descending price order and focussed on those centered around the current dispatch price. Next to the price column for each bid, the table shows the volume offered in that price band by each generating unit, while the second last column to the right shows how much of that volume was called on (the “Band Target”) by AEMO’s NEM Dispatch Engine (“NEMDE”). Higher priced bids with a band target of 0 MW are not dispatched. For this DI, Tarong units are setting price at $98.94/MWh, being the last bids dispatched to meet scheduled demand. We can also see that there are not all that many bids at prices between $100/MWh and $13,800/MWh.Those intervening bids are all from gas turbine units at Braemar A (units 1-3), Braemar B (units 5-7), Oakey, and Yabulu (Townsville). And while there seem to be plenty of MW offered in those bands and able to supply increases in Queensland demand, not all of these units are started up and online – only those that I’ve indicated with the green circles ( ez2view ’s Region Schematic widget for Queensland readily shows which units were running, but that’s omitted here for space reasons). There is thus very little spare capacity offered at prices below $13,800/MWh on units which are actually running . The offline units will be ready to start when called on, but gas turbines don’t start producing power instantly and generally need 5 – 10 minutes to run through their startup sequence. (One reason those GTs are not already running may be the high market price of gas – around $10/GJ – and at prices below $100/MWh or even a little higher, those units would be running at a loss to stay online.) So if demand increases by not too much in the next DI, NEMDE will need to dispatch what extra MW are bid from those running GTs, but will pretty quickly run into the very high price bands at the upper end of the bidstack. Which is exactly what transpired in DI 10:35, setting the price up at $14,000/MWh (there were some minor changes in bids between the two intervals but they don’t materially change the picture, hence I’ve omitted the 10:35 bidstack view). Subsequent Events As explained in the quick answer above, the very high price in the first 5 minute dispatch interval and the “ 5/30 ” effect of 30 minute financial settlement prices being the simple average of this and the next five dispatch prices, strongly incentivise generators to rebid, increasing volumes in lower price bands to increase dispatch, and price-sensitive loads to reduce demand. And to limit the length of this post, we can see how all this played out over the remainder of the half hour in this swim lanes view: We see: Spot prices plunging to low levels as generators rebid volumes to lower prices Demand falling by nearly 300 MW, almost certainly due to price-responsive loads reducing Dispatched Generation increasing by over 500 MW (including startups at a number of the offline gas turbine units mentioned above), and Interconnector flows turning around from 200 MW of import to over 600 MW of export from Queensland to NSW, producing a significant net southward flow for the half hour, even though the average Queensland price for the half hour ($2,353.04/MWh) was – thanks to that single $14,000/MWh spike – well above the NSW half hourly average ($49.65/MWh). And hence the negative settlement residues referred to in Mitch’s tweet. A lot of activity prompted by one five-minute price spike!

    "date": "25-01-2017 11:32:00 AM",
    "content": "NEM power consumption increases 0.8% Solar and energy efficiency account for 1% reduction in consumption Greenhouse emissions fell by 1.3% in 2016 Renewables increase market share from 12.2% to 14.7% Five renewable plants start operating and one fossil-fuel plant ceases Summary Electricity consumption in the National Electricity Market (NEM) increased by 0.8% in 2016, this is on top of a 1.1% increase in 2015. Queensland and NSW experienced increases in consumption with all other states experiencing a reduction. We estimate that solar energy and energy efficiency activities supported by the Renewable Energy Target and various state based energy efficiency schemes reduced electricity consumption by 1,851 GWh. This is the equivalent of a 1% reduction in total consumption. Renewable generation (excluding roof-top solar) accounted for 14.7% of total generation which was considerably higher than the 12.2% market share achieved in 2015. Hydro output increased by 27.8% and wind increased by 11.8%. Large-scale solar, whilst still relatively small is starting to register a growing contribution with five plants generating into the NEM in 2016. Gas-fired generation dropped significantly again in 2016, falling by 17.9% on 2015 levels which in turn was 18.6% lower than 2014. Brown coal generation reduced by 6.8% due to the closure of the Northern Power Station in South Australia and lower generation from Victorian plants. Black coal generation increased by 3.5%, predominantly from Queensland generators. With lower generation from brown coal being replaced by an increase in black coal fired generation and renewables making up for the reduction in gas fired generation and increase in demand, NEM emissions reduced by 1.3%. The emission intensity of generation reduced by 2.1% falling from 0.817 tonnes per MWh in 2015 to 0.800 tonnes per MWh in 2016. Six major new renewable projects above 10MW started generating for the first time in 2016; Hornsdale Wind Fam (SA), Ararat Wind Farm (Vic), Moree Solar Farm (NSW), Mugga Lane Solar Park in the ACT (included in NSW) and the Barcaldine Solar Farm in Queensland, as well as the Coonooer Bridge Wind Farm. Although Coonooer Bridge generation is not reported by AEMO and is missing from numbers reported here. The Northern Power Station in SA was the only significant fossil fuel plant to cease generating in 2016. This Green Energy Markets Insight analyses the changes in electricity generation and consumption in the NEM for the year ending 31 December 2016 and compares it to the same period in 2015 . Our analysis is based on scheduled metered demand and metered generation data published by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and provided through Global Roam’s NEM-Review . The data does not directly measure actual consumption as it includes transmission losses, power station auxiliary use (power used in the power station) and excludes non-scheduled generation. As transmission losses, auxiliary use and non-scheduled generation have been fairly stable in recent years it nevertheless provides a solid basis for analysing year on year changes to electricity consumption. 1. NEM electricity consumption After declining for a number of years’ electricity consumption in the NEM (as measured by scheduled demand) continued its 2015 direction and increased by 0.8% in 2016 (refer to Figure 1). Figure 1. Metered scheduled demand from 2006 to 2016 Underlying electricity consumption increased in Queensland and NSW (Table 1) with the other states experiencing a reduction in consumption. The continued start-up of the LNG plants explains a reasonable proportion of the growth in Queensland. The extended impact of the Basslink outage was predominantly responsible for lower demand in Tasmania. Table 1 – Metered electricity demand by state – GWh (2016 cf: 2015) Approximately 620 MW a year of roof-top solar PV was installed in NEM states and created certificates under the Renewable Energy Target over the 2015 and 2016 period. This is estimated to have generated an additional 856 GWh in 2016 and appears as a reduction in scheduled demand. The contribution of solar hot water and an array of energy efficiency activities supported by state based energy savings schemes have also contributed to lower electricity consumption. There are four energy efficiency schemes operating across the NEM; in NSW, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT. We have analysed the number of certificates or abatement that has been generated by a range of approved activities over the 2015 and 2016 period to estimate the full year impact. In total, identifiable energy efficiency activities could reasonably account for 909 GWh of demand reduction in 2016 (Figure 2). We estimate that solar installations supported by the Renewable Energy Target and energy efficiency activities supported by the various state based schemes will have contributed 1,851 GWh in 2016, equivalent to a 1% reduction in total consumption for the year. The impact of a variety of other factors such as population growth, economic growth, changes in manufacturing usage and weather contributed an increase of 2,508 GWh (1.3% of total consumption) Figure 2. Contributors to changes in electricity consumption (2016 cf: 2015) 2. Power generation in the NEM In analysing metered generation we have included all generators for which AEMO publishes generation data. This includes all scheduled generation and also larger non-scheduled generators which are predominantly hydro and wind generators. The total metered generation figures are thus slightly higher than the scheduled demand. Changes in the generation mix in the NEM for 2016 are summarised in Figure 3. Hydro increased generation in 2016 by 27.8% after having fallen in 2015 by 8.2%. Snowy and Victorian hydro generators increased their output markedly, more than offsetting lower output from Tasmanian hydro generators. Black coal-fired generation in Queensland was responsible for the overall increase in black coal fired generation of 3.5%. Gas-fired generation dropped significantly in Queensland and NSW largely accounting for the overall reduction of 17.9%. The reduction in gas fired generation in 2016 comes on top of a 18.6% reduction in 2015. Over a two-year period, gas-fired generation market share has reduced from 13.1% in 2014 to 8.6% in 2016. Figure 3. Differences in metered generation by fuel (2016 cf: 2015) Wind generation increased by 11.8% in 2016. This was due to the commencement of the Ararat and Hornsdale wind farms and a full year’s output from the Bald Hills wind farm. In addition, 2016 was windier than 2015 with the average capacity factor for the year being more than 34% compared to 32% in 2015. Wind accounted for 44% of South Australia’s total generation in 2016, considerably higher than the 37% achieved in 2015. Table 2 – AEMO metered electricity generation by state and fuel (2015 cf: 2014) Snowy hydro generation in 2016 was more than double 2015 levels with Tasmanian hydro generation being 7% higher (Figure 4). Figure 4. Snowy and Tasmanian Hydro historical generation levels 3. New generation projects Five large metered renewable generators came on line in 2016, including three large solar power stations (Table 3). Table 3 – New power projects that started operating in 2016 4. Generators that were closed or mothballed The Northern Power Station was the only major fossil fuel power station to cease operating during 2016 (Table 4). Table 4 – Power projects that ceased operating in 2016 5. Greenhouse gas emissions Greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 1.3% in 2016 (Table 5). The emission intensity of generation reduced by 2.1% falling from 0.817 tonnes per MWh in 2015 to 0.800 tonnes per MWh in 2016. The reduced emission intensity was due to black coal replacing brown coal fired generation and a significant increase in renewable generation replacing gas fired generation. Table 5 – NEM Greenhouse gas emissions by fuel (2016 cf 2015) Notes and references: Electricity consumption data has been sourced from AEMO (NEM-Review) and reflects the level of scheduled generation required to meet that demand. This therefore includes power station auxiliaries and losses; The AEMO metered generation data includes scheduled generators and some of the larger non-scheduled generators. Smaller non-scheduled renewables are excluded and we estimate that this amounts to more than 3,500 GWh (1.8% of total generation); Roof-top solar PV is not included as a generation source and is included as lower electricity consumption; Emissions intensity data by NEM generator has been sourced from the ACIL Allen Report to AEMO dated 11 April 2014 “Emission Factors – Review of Emission Factors for use in the CDEII”; and State and fuel source classifications for generators has also been based on the ACIL Allen Report dated 11 April 2014.

    "title": "A more forensic look at Queensland Price Volatility on Saturday 14th January 2017",
    "date": "24-01-2017 11:33:00 AM",
    "content": "Back late on Saturday 14th January when I posted this preliminary article , I used the term “sizzling Saturday” to describe the day for a variety of reasons – first was the peak temperature that drove high demand levels ( preceding this new all-time record ) but then, related to that, was some pretty remarkable volatility . Since that time, there’s been much said about the volatility across a variety of medium (including in person), but unfortunately we have to wait some weeks for the more official reports from the AER into the volatility – hence I thought it worthwhile to invest some time over the weekend to put this more forensic review together. (A) Summing up price outcomes on the day The following chart from NEM-Review sums up the trend of prices over the three-day period – Friday 13th, Saturday 14th and Sunday 15th January (the image taken from the animation below): On that day (Saturday 14th January) were 14 Trading Periods where the QLD price settled above $1000/MWh – as listed in the table below for ease of reference: Trading Period Price Reached Notes 1 07:00 $2,320.28/MWh 2 13:30 $2,381.47/MWh 3 14:30 $2,412.34/MWh 4 15:00 $2,276.64/MWh 5 15:30 $2,452.85/MWh 6 16:00 $2,448.08/MWh 7 16:30 $12,641.69/MWh The AER will investigate and report on this one, as they note here – being above $5,000 8 17:00 $8594.83/MWh The AER will investigate and report on this one, as they note here – being above $5,000 9 17:30 $9,126.80/MWh The AER will investigate and report on this one, as they note here – being above $5,000 10 18:00 $2,376.38/MWh 11 18:30 $4,208.57/MWh 12 19:00 $10,416.96/MWh The AER will investigate and report on this one, as they note here – being above $5,000 13 20:00 $2,397.93/MWh 14 23:00 $2,195.38/MWh As noted in the table, the AER report, when it is published here (they say “by 14th March”) will only be on the four >$5,000/MWh spikes, and will be particularly focused on the “did anyone break the rules?” question. We also expect that AEMO will publish a report on the day here – though again this is also a work in progress. In the meantime, the following analysis might be of some assistance to a range of people… (B) Animation of each dispatch interval through the day Taking advantage of the automated “Time Travel & Record” function built within our ez2view energy sector browser, and investing a number of hours into sequencing it together, I’ve built the following animation: A quick disclaimer with respect to the above – all errors and omissions (and I am sure there are a few) in the animation are my fault . 1) They may be due to lack of time to complete this thoroughly, or it might be due to some deficiency in my understanding, or it might be for some other reason. 2) Please feel free to point them out in comments below – or contact me directly, if you prefer. Call me on +61 (0)7 3368 4064 . (C) Highlighting some factors & questions From the animation above, I’ve pulled out some of the factors mentioned to flag them for (possible) later analysis. Note that I do mean “possible” – as we have a number of initiatives on the go at present, and I have already blown our budget of time for analysis and commentary on WattClarity unfortunately: C1) Underlying supply/demand dynamics Through the animation, there were a number of general questions flagged about the overall supply/demand balance: C1a) Gas Prices In the animation above, I included a snapshot from the GasWatch product, Time-Travelled back to 14th January to highlight the gas prices that applied to uncontracted gas supplies on the day: At gas price of $11.51/GJ this would translate to a break-even cost of generation of something like $130/MWh : (a) For an open cycle GT; (b) Not factoring in delivery of gas; (c) Not factoring in variable O&M. The true cost would be something north of this – suffice to say little incentive to turn on that day until electricity prices well above $100/MWh . C1b) Contribution of Solar – Waxing and Waning Also flagged on WattClarity on other days, we see contributions from solar PV declining into every afternoon after a peak relatively early in the day ( peak shown before 12:00 in this post from Thursday 12th January ). We also see (in the table above) that the spikes in price mostly occur later in the afternoon when the contribution from solar PV has mostly diminished. One way to think of this is that solar PV progressively bids to infinity later in the afternoon as its capacity to supply wanes. When coupled with gas generators bidding well north of $100/MWh, one can see that there’s dwindling real competitive pressure . NOTE – this is not to be confused with the incorrect “solar does not reduce peak demand” argument, which is addressed in a separate post today . C1c) Only two big competitors On a number of occasions here on WattClarity (and also in this detailed review of volatility in summer 2012-13 ) we have previously flagged the uplift in volatility that arose from the “3-into-2 merger” of Stanwell, Tarong and CS Energy into “new” Stanwell and “new” CS Energy. From the QLD Treasury perspective: i. I imagine they are very grateful to not have to continue to prop up loss-making enterprises (some large cheques written in years gone by. ii. Indeed, days like this will have improved the profit position. This dynamic has remained – though thankfully Labor’s election promise to merge Stanwell and CS Energy seems to have been quietly shelved ( as Rod Sims noted here ). What’s more than a little crazy is the fact that it was ever mooted in the first place. C1d) Unhedged capacity Over the past week a number of journalists have written about the production impact felt at Boyne Smelter ( on the 19th and the 20th in the AFR, and on the 19th and the 20th in the Oz). Given our involvement in supporting a growing number of large energy users operating with some form of spot exposure and physical curtailment (a form of demand response ) this development is of keen interest to us. What’s been less noted has been the ironic situation whereby manufacturing plant, who opt for spot exposure because the contract prices offered to them are uneconomic create an environment are less fully hedged. What this might result in is an incentive for the generator to push this unhedged capacity to higher price bid bands – both: i. To create short term volatility, and hence drive current quarter returns; and also ii. To heighten concerns about future supply and hence drive up contract prices. However it is a fine balancing act , as higher contract prices will encourage new entrants (witness the large number of large-scale solar plant vying for commercial start in Queensland in the next year or two, for instance – including one sponsored by another major industrial ). Once that “golden goose” has been cooked , it’ll be cooked for good… C1e) Physical and financial prices The animation (above) was specifically focused on the wholesale physical market – no view was provided of the financial market. I’ve posted separately today with this illustration of how the price extremes in the physical market have already flowed through to Q1 2018 and Q1 2019 hedge contracts . A permanent effect or more temporary? C1f) Flow-through to retail prices Outside of the relatively few (large) energy users who have some spot exposure in their energy procurement arrangements (when mixed with physical risk management can deliver lower average cost – a form of demand response ) most energy users will be interested in how periods of volatility like this: (i) Will already have been factored into their current retail contract, in the form of a volatility premium; and/or (ii) Is likely to flow through into future contract periods, by pushing up wholesale contract prices. Seeing the transfer of one day of spot market volatility (now historical) into uplift on quarter baseload contracts (still in the future), it becomes understandable how spot market volatility flows through to all of us. C1g) What this might mean for the “50% renewable by 2030 state target” Given the number of people who apparently support renewable development in survey after survey ( notwithstanding the apparent disconnect with a lower percentage that actually follows through with their own financial commitment ), I can understand this will be of interest to many. Above, I have noted about the balancing act the Queensland generators (and in particular Stanwell Corporation and CS Energy) need to play if they are to achieve the “goldilocks” outcome of “just enough” price uplift feeding through into profit over the next 24 months without incentivising solar PV development to swamp the market come 2020. However I’ve previously provided some comments on the current Government’s audacious plan to transform the energy supply chain in Queensland in a remarkably short timeframe. If it is true that the Government implicit mandate is to run Stanwell and CS Energy into the ground, then one might wonder if they then think “well, what does it matter about Goldilocks – why not make hay when the sun shines, as the end is nigh anyway!?” Unfortunately this might end up with the exit of a number of manufacturing installations. An “easier” way to make someone’s numbers, in terms of a percentage-driven target, but perhaps not in many people’s genuine interest? C2) Nuances of the price setting method Those with keen eyes will also have noted, in the animation above, a number of dispatch intervals where outcomes seemed a little stranger than normal – some of these are flagged below. Along with these are a number of principles that should perhaps not need espousing, but are echoed anyway: C2a) Why it is necessary that the price can spike to $14,000/MWh I’ve previously discussed on WattClarity before why such a high price cap is necessary as part of a market that is both: (a) “Energy-only”; and (b) “Gross pool”. I won’t go into this again, but feel free to contact me if you are interested. C2b) Why it is essential that generators can rebid – including for “commercial” reasons, and as close as possible to “gate closure” I’ve also previously commented on this, as well – such as here . C2c) About the 5/30 issue Also on WattClarity, we have previously included a number of articles discussing the 5/30 issue, such as these ones . C2d) How Constraint Equations impact on price outcomes On all of the occasions when the Queensland price spiked, flows with NSW were constrained in some form. In this animation, however, we did not drill into the details of transmission constraints (we have in some prior animations , though). C2e) Dispatch Intervals where no bid shown was seen to set the price No time to discuss more currently – the Current Bids widget was focused on Energy Prices, was filtered to QLD bids, and was set to keep the current QLD price in focus. C2f) Dispatch Intervals where tranches at lower price are not dispatched Perhaps another time we can get into ramp rates and other constraints… C2g) Dispatch Intervals where tranches received some dispatch even above the dispatch price No time to delve into this one, either C2h) Several contributors to “Price Setter” There were a number of instances highlighting this (D) Understanding more about “How Prices are Set, in the NEM” As noted, I don’t have any extra time currently to delve into more detail. (a) I’m also not an expert – and am, in more general terms, nervous when I see how liberally this term is used in the media and in other quarters these days . (b) I am just someone who asks a lot of questions, seeking to understand more and more – and, in asking questions, is able to progressively enhance the software products we develop with the valued support of our long-term clients. One of the people who have helped us greatly over the past couple of years as we have sought to progressively improve our ez2view higher-end dashboard has been Allan O’Neil, a former Analyst/Trader and Manager Analysis at EnergyAustralia. He is probably also nervous about being labelled an “expert” – so suffice to say that he’s one person who I trust to give me a straight answer to a question, or to tell me he does not know. He’s begun providing an on-site educational service about “how prices are set, in the NEM” focusing specifically on wholesale physical prices (i.e. what we in Australia call the “spot” market). If the article (and animation) above generate more questions than answers, then this might be a good opportunity for you to also work your way up the learning curve. Allan’s details are here .",

    "title": "One example of how price spikes in the physical market flow through to the financial market",
    "date": "24-01-2017 08:59:00 AM",
    "content": "Today I’ve posted this broader review of the volatility experienced on Saturday 14th January in the wholesale physical (“spot”) market that is AEMO’s domain in the National Electricity Market. That article, and particularly the animation, focused wholly on the physical market. However, as noted there, physical market volatility (in the current quarter) can flow through to high contract prices (in future quarters) . It’s not strictly “logical” but instead is based on sentiment . 1) Many times we see how volatility wakes some people to the risk (they might be traders, or they might be energy users or other wholesale market customers) – which leads to higher volume requirements for hedge, so driving contract prices. 2) On rarer occasions, retailers (wholesale market customers) have gone bust – at least in part as a result of hedging strategies that perhaps ignored too much risk, till it came home to bite them. My understanding is that there were three of them – Jackgreen, EnergyOne and GoEnergy (feel free to correct). Using an early beta of NEM-Review v7 (already available to existing NEM-Review v6 clients, and also available in different forms to ez2view and deSide clients) I’ve generated this trend of both physical and financial contract prices for Queensland from 1st December 2016: As noted on the chart, the spike in daily spot prices on January 14th has driven both: 1) A literal jump in the traded price of the Q1 2017 futures contract; and 2) A sentiment-driven jump (not so large, but still significant) in traded price for Q1 2018 and Q1 2019. More on this at another time…",

    "title": "Illustrating how the currently installed rooftop solar PV has reduced peak demand – but more won’t reduce it more**",
    "date": "24-01-2017 08:49:00 AM",
    "content": "In conjunction with this larger post (including animation) looking into what happened in the Queensland region on “sizzling Saturday” (14th January 2017) , I’ve powered up NEM-Review v6 to create the following chart: It’s not 100% accurate (as there are other factors to consider) but adding Rooftop PV (AEMO estimate*) to the Scheduled Demand for the region provides, in aggregate, a view of approximately what total consumption has been across the three days shown (Friday 13th, Saturday 14th and Sunday 15th). * with respect to the AEMO estimates, see my prior note about the opacity of small-scale PV . Thankfully with AEMO data we’re able to start publishing about these insights. Ten years ago, “Consumption” and “Scheduled Demand” might have been pretty much the same thing – but increasingly the two are diverging , and both need to be kept in mind to understand where the electricity system is headed. This chart is fairly typical of what we’re seeing – and is not unique to Queensland, either. What it shows is two related things: #1) The batch of rooftop solar PV currently installed has definitely reduced peak demand This is very apparent in the chart above – which is just a random example. On Friday 13th January, for instance, we can clearly see that the demand would have peaked above 9,500MW had it not been for rooftop solar PV. Similarly, on Saturday 14th January, the demand would have peaked above 9,000MW – and so on… #2) … however more of the same won’t deliver more benefit (and is likely to bring its own challenges) As per the second note on the chart, however, because the time of peak demand has shifted to late afternoon (when rooftop solar PV injections are waning) the addition of more solar panels won’t deliver any more benefit to the market in terms of reduction of peak demand. Indeed, because of the “duck curve” phenomenon we’ve spoken about previously on WattClarity, it will come with its own challenges. Don’t take this as a reason to stop building solar PV – however please do: i. Stop promoting it on the basis that more will reduce peak demand more ; and ii. Understand some of the challenges that come with it. ** UPDATE at 17:30 Two of our valued readers has let me know that the above is not that clear – for which I apologise. Both readers had two particularly useful points to make – hence the update here: #1) Assuming north facing When I make the comment that “more solar PV won’t reduce peak demand more”, what was I left unstated was the “… if it’s more of the same”. With this I particularly mean the current incentive structure geared towards a kWh harvest, which provides the (quite logical) motivation for people to install PV on north-facing rooftops. As seen in the chart above, this has had a great effect on reducing demand in the middle of the day – however that’s not where the peak demand is any more (see point 2). If the incentive were to change, say, to promote west-facing panels (for at least a reasonable proportion of new installs) then we would see the afternoon peak reduce more – however it would be at a “cost” to the owner of a lower kWh harvest. Hence the question why would they do this? Not too many are purely altruistic. #2) It varies by location Another telling comment was made that the details are buried in the distribution system – down at zone substation level, or even lower at the feeders. We’re working on data sets down at that level that might help with that puzzle…",

    "title": "[UPDATED] NEM-wide demand screams past 34,000MW today",
    "date": "17-01-2017 03:37:00 PM",
    "content": "Given the many factors that have influenced the trend of declining demand since around 2008 in the NEM (solar PV probably being the most talked about one, though the list is a lot longer than that), and head down in other aspects of what we are doing to make complexity understandable in other parts of the energy sector, I was very surprised to switch back to the overview provided by NEM-Watch and see the NEM-wide demand climbing past 34,000MW. The earliest snapshot I’d grabbed earlier today was the following one from NEM-Watch at 07:00 this morning (as noted here, the calm before the storm): By 12:05, as I’d tweeted at the time, the NEM-Wide “Scheduled Demand” Dispatch Target had climbed past 30,000MW for what I think is the first time this summer. Note that both NSW and QLD had climbed out of the green zone (in terms of demand relative to historical extremes) at this point in time: I was not paying too much attention to the dashboard today (busy down at the battery storage end of the supply chain ) until I glanced up and saw this view of the 15:25 dispatch interval. In particular, I noted three things: (a) I saw showing NEM-wide demand up at 33,783MW . (b) As a result, as noted in the snapshot, I saw the NEM-Wide IRPM (Instantaneous Reserve Plant Margin) down at a low level of 13% . (c) I saw the very rare event of demand peaks in NSW coinciding with demand peaks in QLD (the colour coding of both regions very Orange , as shown). In fact, off the top of my head I cannot remember seeing that happen on any specific occasion in the past. At just a bit more than 4,000MW of spare capacity, it does show major challenge of the planned closure of large (>1,600MW) Hazelwood power station in Victoria come the end of March: (a) An unequivocal win for emissions reduction ; (b) A more challenging outcome for security of supply (note comments here about some challenges ); (c) Much less certain, also, in terms of probable price outcomes – any politician, consultant, investor, or other that tells you otherwise is talking their book . Note that an even more significant impact would be felt if industrial action at Loy Yang A were to take it offline for an extended period. I posted the single image above at 15:36 (NEM time) and had to head out for a while (thankful that it was Brisbane temperatures, and not Sydney ones, I had to encounter). Returning to this post now, here are a few extremes relevant for the day: Highest NEM-wide demand today At the time this post was updated, Scheduled Demand had reached 34,396MW at 16:50 on a dispatch target basis – before beginning a slow decline. By way of comparison, this was only 1,000MW off the all-time record experienced back on Thursday 29th January 2009 – a few days prior to “black Saturday”. Lowest NEM-Wide IRPM today Whilst out, my NEM-Watch SMS alerts continued to remind me of the low levels of IRPM being experienced – with the lowest being down at 11.63% at 17:00 . To put this into context, other articles referencing low IRPM are linked here . Highest NSW regional demand today The NSW demand reached 13,745MW at 17:00 – again, before beginning the slow decline into the evening. Back on 1st February 2011 the NSW region experienced a regional demand of 14,649MW (on the same basis as here – Scheduled Demand, dispatch target). We can see that today’s peak was less than 1,000MW below that . Highest QLD regional demand today The QLD demand reached 8,941MW at 16:55 – again, before beginning the slow decline into the evening. Already last Friday we saw QLD demand reach 9,088MW this summer – which was 70MW off setting a new record. Stay tuned for more this summer!",

    "title": "QLD’s Cumulative Price over half way to the Cumulative Price Threshold after a “sizzling Saturday”",
    "date": "14-01-2017 05:27:00 PM",
    "content": "Numerous SMS alerts today from NEM-Watch Platinum reminded me that the hot weather in southern Queensland was driving demand high on a weekend, and hence still impacting on prices. Here’s the single snapshot from NEM-Watch today at 16:50, coincident with me sitting down to write this short post. It shows the Queensland Cumulative Price over half-way to the Cumulative Price Threshold : For the 2016-17 financial year, the CPT is set at $210,000 (i.e. 15 x the Market Price Cap). Should the Cumulative Price reach the CPT, then AEMO is required under the rules and step in to cap prices in the Queensland region for a period of time. Off the top of my head, I don’t think it has ever happened in the Queensland region, despite periods of great volatility (it did reach about the same level in March 2015 , for instance) – however it has happened elsewhere, at least as follows: (A) Victoria has hit the Cumulative Price Threshold once before Few in the market, or the energy sector, will forget the events of late January 2009 when extreme temperatures led to bushfires (including “black Saturday”) and extreme outcomes in the electricity market as well. I posted this article on Thursday 29th January 2009 to describe some of what happened on that day – including both Victoria and South Australia hitting the CPT. (B) South Australia has hit the Cumulative Price Threshold several times before This happened a number of times, including at least these instances documented on WattClarity before: B1) In March 2007, after an extraordinary late heatwave , the B2) As noted above, Thursday 29th January 2009 saw the CPT reached in South Australia – however also noteworthy that it almost reached that level about a week earlier (on Tuesday 20th January) as well. B3) On Friday 13th November 2009 the South Australian region hit the CPT after some late spring volatility. (C) Tasmania has hit the Cumulative Price Threshold once before On Tuesday 16th June 2009, the CPT was reached in Tasmania later in the evening. (D) NSW has not reached the CPT before, I think It has come close, though – like this point in February 2011 where the Cumulative Price rose above $150,000 (at this time the CPT had risen from $150,000 because of the rise of the Market Price Cap above $10,000/MWh). Note that the Cumulative Price is up at $124,373 in the 17:30 dispatch interval as I release this note – and current dispatch volatility means it will trend higher still… Buckle up for a challenging summer, in a number of different ways… PS late on Sunday I’ve been out for the day, though the NEM-Watch SMS and Email alarms continued in response to ongoing volatility. Checking in now sees the Sunday 18:20 snapshot from NEM-Watch showing the Cumulative Price now up over $150,000 :",

    "content": "With our attention focused on other initiatives (like our work in the battery storage area ) and then an afternoon/evening post about the highest demand seen so far this summer in Queensland , we have scant time to dig into the details of what’s been going on at Loy Yang A. Frequent readers will recall these comments posted late in 2016 about talk of a strike at Loy Yang A , perhaps affecting coal supplies to Loy Yang B as well, over the Christmas period. The strike did not go ahead, but the dramas continue. We did notice, however, that the ABC and the Oz and the FinReview (along with others) reported that the Fair Work Commission had agreed to terminate the EBA at the center of the stand-off between AGL Energy and unions at Loy Yang A power station. Over at the Age, we see that their article goes further – talking about the possibility of mass resignations at the station as a result, which would surely put the plant out of action for a long period of time. 1) With the weather forecast for Victoria showing some high temperatures currently plugged for Tuesday next week (which may flow through to higher demand levels – though not currently showing huge levels in AEMO’s ST PASA forecasts ) and the world’s media focused on Melbourne because of the Aussie Open, sounds like a recipe for much more to come… 2) I note that this article from the ABC seems to imply that the pay cuts would not happen until 1st May, which might mean another month or two before the resignations happened if a new EBA cannot be negotiated – which might put it around the same time as the Hazelwood closure .

    "content": "With the hot weather rolling on from yesterdays peak above 9,000MW in Queensland , it was not really a surprise to see Scheduled Demand top 9,000MW again today – as noted in the sequence of NEM-Watch snapshots below: The earliest snapshot I gathered was the following one at 09:00 this morning – at which time the demand was already nudging 8,000MW after some pretty unpleasant overnight temperatures: By 10:30 we saw demand above 8,000MW : By 12:20 we see demand a few 100MWs higher at 8,419MW – and (as noted in the image below) we see solar injections for the day maxed out, and about to begin their daily decline . Because of the outstanding success of the 44c FIT and the way the RET works, we’ve incentivised 400,000 QLD residents ( like me ) to install panels facing north to maximise kWh harvest – but it does have the very unfortunate side-effect of tailing off from relatively early in the day at the same time as air-conditioning load continues to ramp up. A lesson in being very sure of the outcome we want when designing policies like that… At 16:35 we noted the warning trigger for Low IRPM (Instantaneous Reserve Plant Margin) for the Queensland “Economic Island”. In layman’s terms, a tight supply-demand balance by virtue of both: the weather-induced afternoon air-conditioning load at work and at home; and the decline of solar PV injections as the sun drops (but the heat stays) into the afternoon. This was captured in the following snapshot, which also shows the Scheduled Demand at 9,015MW . As tweeted with the 16:45 snapshot, the dispatch price finally spiked as high as the Market Price Cap ($14,000/MWh) off the back of high demand, fading (afternoon) solar PV injections, and overall tight supply/demand balance: As noted on this snapshot, the Scheduled Demand Target at 9,056MW was only 102MW shy of the record set on 1st February 2016 .

By 17:05 it had climbed further to 9,088MW – only 70MW lower than the all-time record : At the time of posting (17:30) this was the highest level of demand seen today… With the growth in upstream compression load for LNG exports, it was expected that we’ll see a new peak demand this summer .

This was an increase of 991MW over almost 5 hours – so a regular but steady incline (with the exception of a reduction via spot-exposed demand response that occurred with the price spike in the 12:35 dispatch interval we can see in the snapshot below).

Less time to do the normal amount of NEM-watching as well, or posting longer commentary here on WattClarity. I did notice today with the temperatures rising in NSW that the demand had awoken from its green zone slumber and was climbing towards the orange zone – as I noted in this tweet of an annotated NEM-Watch screenshot: At that time (13:15 NEM time, so 14:15 in Sydney) the Scheduled Demand was up at 12,550MW . I also noted on the snapshot that the “Native Demand” more what the layperson might think of as consumption would have been something like 13,850MW, which would still be below the all-time record set on 1st February 2011 as recorded here (back at that time there was no solar PV to speak of, and little wind – hence “Scheduled Demand” would have been much closer to “Native Demand”). Only 50 minutes later, we see that the Scheduled Demand had risen to 12,794MW (at 14:05) – so showing a more orange colour. One of the reasons for this will be the accelerating fading of small-scale solar injections into the afternoon: In general terms, crude feed-in-tariff incentives have been for households to install solar PV on north facing rooftops (to maximise kWh yield) rather than west facing rooftops (which would yield more network benefits at times or peak loading, in most cases). As such, this “duck curve” effect is seen to begin waning in early afternoon. At 14:50 (the time of posting) the NSW Scheduled Demand had risen to 12,840MW . PS it’s also noteworthy that the demand in QLD was also up in the orange zone ( QLD demand up to 8,440MW at 14:50 ), though this has been a much more common occurrence of late (and also because of the “less peaky” demand shape exhibited in the region).",

Doing this in my copy reveals that the NSW demand was also down at a relatively low level compared to its historical levels – however not to quite the same extent as seen in Victoria: Opening up NEM-Review for some time-series analysis I’ve added this chart here looking at daily MIN, MAX and AVERAGE Scheduled Demand since January 2014: This trend shows how remarkably low are the demand levels consistently being seen in Victoria , certainly from 1st December onwards at least in part due to the ongoing technical issues at Alcoa’s Portland Aluminium smelter (which occurred during the transmission outage noted here ).",

    "title": "SA electricity demand at New Year’s exhibiting the “Duck Curve” affliction",
    "date": "01-01-2017 04:18:00 PM",
    "content": "With the hot weather front afflicting people more north of Sydney currently, it’s clearly a case of extremes across the NEM over the New Year period – with daytime demand levels very low in South Australia (and also in Victoria – with these questions posed previously about that). A snapshot from NEM-Watch this afternoon shows the five-minute dispatch price at 15:00 down very close to $0/MWh, and Scheduled Demand in South Australia down at 737MW: Now the sliding colour-scale dynamically applied to South Australia’s demand provides only a light-blue hue – but that’s because of the reset that occurred after the blackout of September 28th in the year just gone. Two quick points, which we might follow up on in more detail on a real working day: (1) Demand dropping The NEM, and electricity supply in more general terms, is a complex beast – there are many different variables influencing levels of electricity consumption. Here are three, for instance, with respect to what’s happening this afternoon: (1a) People sleeping off their NYE hangover Perhaps most people are awake at this point after whatever celebrations they got up to for New Year’s Eve – but it is still a holiday (and a Sunday, to boot). Hence pretty low demand normally – we can see this in the following comparison of the Sunday extremes that occurred through 2016 in the following NEM-Review trend: Excluding the effects of the blackout of September 28th, we see that the lowest Sunday demand through the year was just under 700MW on 30th October (which we would, in days of yesteryear, have assumed had happened in the depths of the night). In contrast we see (in the NEM-Watch snapshot above) that the demand was not as low as this today. (1b) Weather is moderate in South Australia, and particularly Adelaide The snapshot from NEM-Watch above only highlights the temperature in Adelaide – given how it is easily the biggest driver of air-conditioning load in the State. The ECA-sponsored NEM-Watch Consumption Widget shows a more colourful view with a greater range of temperature measurement points. The snapshot below was taken at 15:48 NEM time: In this case, keep in mind that the measure of “demand” used here is closer to Operational Demand than Scheduled Demand. (1c) Solar is eating away day-time demand By this time we have all heard about the “Duck Curve” – and how it is eating away day-time demand. The original snapshot from NEM-Watch above provides some great examples of this effect over New Year’s Eve, and New Year’s Day. (2) Two different perspectives on “the Duck Curve” Indeed, the Duck Curve has eaten into Scheduled Demand to such an extent in the South Australian region that Pelican Point switched off this afternoon, (presumably because they opted not to lose money on generation). As noted on the image, this reduced South Australia to a reliance on only three units at Torrens and supplies over the interconnector for all FCAS services. We understand that wind farms, batteries, and demand response can (technically) help to supply these services in future – however, to my knowledge, they are not currently doing so. Economics, and rule changes, and levels of sophistication of new entrants seem to be some of the reasons why. Frequent readers through 2016 and beforehand will not how we strive to remain technology agnostic in this increasingly political energy transition . From the outside looking in it’s apparent that there are a diverse group of people sitting at all points in the Emotion-o-Meter , with an increasingly vocal subset at either end shouting at each other (we don’t expect this to change much in 2017, realistically). With reference to the three axis of the “Energy Trilemma”, the Duck Curve can represent very different things: (2a) Those with a primary focus on Carbon Emissions For those with a primary focus on reducing Carbon Emissions (and/or the more explicit promotion of renewable generation, which is not exactly the same focus) the Duck Curve can represent growing evidence of success in this energy transition. (2b) Those with a focus on System Security and/or Economics For those with a primary focus on keeping the lights on, or keeping costs down in the process of this energy transition, the Duck Curve presents evidence of reduced production volumes for thermal plant with non-zero short-run marginal costs that (for the time being, at least) will continue to be required for System Security. Hence questions about the rate at which the Duck Curve grows, and whether the introduction of these new technologies that will help with system frequency can be introduced at the right pace to keep the system stable as the old workhorses retire. I wonder whether, in 2017, we will see any real progress in the technical/economic/social/political dialogue into what mechanisms will be necessary ( beyond the current myopic fascination over a 2020 RET Target) to help achieve a broader transition. My sense is that “more of the same” in terms of a increased single-focus RET mechanism (or single-focus percentage targets in more general terms) is likely to end in tears . The electricity system is complex – we (collectively) can’t ignore or overlook that complexity forever. Our new year’s resolution – on WattClarity we will continue to strive to understand these complexities, and make them understandable to our readers …",

    "title": "NEM Summer Outlook 2018/19 – what is AEMO saying?",
    "date": "20-12-2018 01:25:00 PM",
    "content": "Following on from Paul’s art i cle on Queensland , this post examines the summer outlook for the other mainland NEM regions, drawing from some key AEMO publications and datasources, namely: the Electricity Statement of Opportunities (ESOO) published in August this year AEMO’s Summer Readiness Report published in November the MTPASA dataset providing dynamic updates of the NEM supply-demand outlook ESOO Summary Although it’s a ten-year outlook document serving a range of purposes, AEMO’s ESOO highlighted short term risks to supply reliability in Victoria for summer 2018/19 in the absence of actions to mitigate the risk of load shedding. AEMO’s projections of expected Unserved Energy (USE) are one illustration of these risks: I’ll ignore the rising longer term levels of USE in these forecasts, driven by scheduled retirements of certain thermal generators and the fact that the ESOO modelling does not assume addition of new generation beyond what has been firmly committed for construction, and keep the focus on summer 2018/19. (And note that Queensland and Tasmania don’t appear in the chart because AEMO does not project any material USE in either region over the outlook period.) While the forecast USE level of just under 0.002% in Victoria this summer seems tiny, this not a probability but expresses AEMO’s estimate of the quantity of load that might be shed (averaged across hundreds of modelling runs) as a proportion of Victoria’s total annual load – further details in this short explainer which I put together after last year’s ESOO publication. AEMO is at pains to point out in the ESOO that in the absence of mitigating measures, it assessed the probability of some load-shedding occurring – so-called “Loss of Load Probability” (LoLP) – to be quite material, particularly in Victoria: Actions proposed by AEMO to address these risks are outlined in both the ESOO and in the more recently published 2018/19 Summer Readiness Report. Reliability – AEMO’s Role The reliability levels (expected USE, LoLP etc) projected in documents like the ESOO are essentially AEMO’s assessment of what the energy market could deliver, given only existing and firmly committed supply and demand resources, in the absence of any central intervention / mitigation such as procurement and use of out-of-market reserves to avoid physical load shedding. The NEM market design, and particularly the reliability settings within that design, are intended to provide market signals – principally via spot and forward prices – to induce commercial participants to invest in supply or demand side capacity sufficient to deliver a defined, high level of reliability (albeit not perfect!) But there has always been provision under the market rules for AEMO to act as a “provider of last resort” where it assesses that participant investments and actions are insufficient to meet reliability standards. Events over recent years, including blackouts and generation retirements, have greatly increased focus on NEM reliability. Nor have they given much comfort that the NEM reliability framework is well understood or that load-shedding of any description is politically acceptable. One consequence of these events and scrutiny has been much more openness from AEMO on its role in managing and coordinating real-time reliability, exemplified in publications such as the Summer Readiness Reports produced in the leadup to last and this summer. And given the tighter supply-demand balance following plant retirements and some evidence of higher generation outage (breakdown) rates, both of these factors pushing assessed reliability levels in Victoria outside or very close to defined thresholds (ie the NEM’s USE standard of 0.002%), for the 2017/18 and 2018/19 summers AEMO has contracted out-of-market supply and demand side resources intended to be used only to “keep the lights on” where the market by itself might not do so. Summer Readiness Report AEMO’s latest Summer Readiness Report builds on the ESOO analysis described above, concluding that some 120 – 525 MW of additional capacity across Victoria and South Australia might be necessary to maintain adequate reliability under extreme but plausible conditions, and provides details on the out-of-market reserves AEMO has contracted, and other reserves potentially available for short notice contracting (often in the form of demand reduction), in the event of reliability threats. In brief AEMO has currently contracted firm access to 130 MW of resources in these regions; is assembling a portfolio of 400 – 800 MW of reserves available for short-notice contracting if required The readiness report also outlines many other steps being taken by AEMO, networks and participants to maximise operational availability of generation and transmission capacity over summer. Tracking Supply/Demand Balance – MTPASA The reliability assessments published in the ESOO and Summer Readiness Report are necessarily point-in-time estimates. In a dynamic market like the NEM, actual supply and demand conditions vary greatly, and forecasts of maximum demands and generation availability can change over time as new information becomes available. AEMO’s suite of PASA reports provide updates in near real time of changes in regional supply/demand balances over various horizons. The MT (medium term) PASA reports published weekly provide data at daily resolution out to two years ahead and provide the principal dynamic view of potential demand and available supply levels for the current summer. In the charts below, produced using the data-rich ez2view trend engine , I’ve built on Paul’s original view of supply/demand balance for Queensland to show the current picture in the other mainland NEM regions: (For registered ez2view users, template copies of these charts can be accessed through the following hyperlinks: NSW , Qld , SA , Vic ) Like most AEMO data, quite a bit of context is required to interpret these charts. In particular: the Potential Peak Demand lines, sub-labelled POE 10 and POE 50 , represent estimates of the demand level that might be reached on each day in the plot if weather conditions on that day equated to the hottest expected for a whole summer, with POE 10 (= 10% Probability of Exceedence) being a 1 year in 10 hot summer and POE 50 a 1 year in 2 (or median) summer. Obviously in reality actual temperatures and demands will be well below these levels on nearly all days of the summer other than the hottest – but no-one knows in advance when that day might occur. So these lines represent not “forecast” demands but “potential maximums” across the range of summer dates. There is a clear weekly patterning to the data showing highest potential demands in the middle days of the working week, as well as a seasonal profile showing concentration of the highest potential temperatures and demands in January and February. the Forecast Max Demand (STPASA) line running out for ~7 days is a short term demand projection based on actual weather forecasts the historic Actual data for Demand and Available Generation use different measurement bases from the PASA forecasts, in particular the forecast available generation line excludes contributions from variable renewable (wind and large scale solar) generators – their potential contribution is accounted for elsewhere in the MTPASA reliability assessment. The historic data include levels of renewable generation that were actually available (hence their variability). Interconnector import capability is not included in the supply available these charts – this capability is also highly dynamic depending on supply/demand balance in adjoining regions and on network constraints. As for variable renewables, assessing the contribution of interconnector capability to reliability is done at a granular level in probabilistic modelling of supply/demand balance and can’t readily be represented in higher level charts like these. Very importantly, the data do NOT include contributions from any out-of-market reserves already contracted or available to be contracted by AEMO. Supply and demand levels reflect those resources available for in-market dispatch only. Despite all these qualifications, the charts provide a view of supply/demand balance which is useful for assessing trends across time and clearly indicate which regions (ie Victoria) would be most reliant on out-of-region (interconnector) or out-of-market (AEMO reserve) support to meet extreme demand levels, if experienced. AEMO has recently modified its MTPASA processes to also produce a day by day assessment of LoLP, included in its suite of MTPASA reports. Adding the results of this calculation to the above charts produces data that look positively horrifying – particularly for Victoria: (Copies for registered ez2view users here: NSW , Qld , SA , Vic ) However a number of important provisos apply: like the Potential Peak Demand series, the daily LoLP estimates are calculated as if highest-in-summer temperature / demand conditions were to occur on each day assessed underlying data (not plotted) indicate that the LoLP calculations appear to use a demand scenario that is in some cases even more extreme than the MTPASA’s POE 10 level (the reason for this has been queried with AEMO, response awaited) the LoLP assessments also appear to use a relatively “pessimistic” assessment of variable renewable contribution For those really interested in the details, AEMO’s MTPASA documentation provides more background. For other readers, the key takeout is that these Loss of Load Probabilities are NOT even remotely forecasts of the chance of the lights going out. There are best read as the likelihood, for any given day in the forecast horizon, that AEMO would need to activate out-of-market reserves to maintain supply if a combination of extreme weather conditions and lower than expected supply were to occur on that particular day – which is inherently a very unlikely event. As such, the LoLP values shouldn’t be interpreted as absolute probabilities, but only as indicators of relative levels of reliability across time and regions. We’ll watch with interest how these views evolve over summer, and provide commentary here on WattClarity of any notable events. Hopefully not too many though!

    "title": "High temperatures (and high demand) forecast for QLD this Friday",
    "date": "19-12-2018 05:25:00 PM",
    "content": "On Monday I noted this Market Notice from AEMO in a copy of our NEM-Watch software warning of high demand forecast for the Queensland region this Friday: Worth noting that the reason for the Market Notice is that the high temperatures: Not only drive electricity demand higher; but Also impact capability of supply-side infrastructure (incl generators) a number of ways… – hence a “double whammy” effect that makes AEMO’s job of balancing supply and demand trickier. In the Market Notice they ask the operators of major power stations to be mindful of the temperature effects on the capability of their assets. We’ll be having a more detailed look at how all individual power stations have performed over time, NEM-wide, in our Generator Report Card 2018 . Since that time, I have been keeping an eye on the forecasts ( clients can also keep an eye online here ) as they have progressively changed, though the demand forecast has remained stubbornly high. Current forecast for Operational Demand* to peak up at 9,420MW in the half-hour ending 17:00 in Queensland as shown here: A couple external prompts this evening have prompted this quick article (apologies for errors/omissions in the rush). It’s a slightly different measure of demand ( read here for the gory details of all the different measures of demand ) but the “Forecast Convergence” widget in the installed ez2view software can provide a view of how AEMO’s successive demand forecasts have been changing. In theory, AEMO’s forecasts should be getting more accurate as we get closer to real time (though the reality is that the weather patterns will also be changing as well) – hence it is of interest to see that the colours are growing redder as we look up the vertical for Friday afternoon/evening. In other words, the demand forecast has been increasing . Now, it’s not demand that we are most interested in – but rather the balance between supply and demand. Flipping Forecast Convergence to look at Surplus Generation (in this case with lower numbers being redder) we see that the forecast is for it to be low (compared to the rest of the week), but some improvement on the forecasts made on Tuesday afternoon/evening: That’s all for now… ————————————- Oh, and a brief PS – those who follow me on LinkedIn or Twitter will note that I’ve posted a couple updates (like those linked there) about the central-to-south constraint binding within the Queensland region a fair amount these days (of course, ez2view clients can see it for themselves). Sadly, we hear that this is one of those constraints that, it seems, new entrants thought would not be affecting them. Back in the real world, however, this constraint is having the effect of winding down output of all of the Scheduled and Semi-Scheduled plant north of Gladstone. If that constraint happens to bind on Friday afternoon/evening, will make an “interesting” situation for the AEMO even more challenging…",

    "title": "How To Reduce Electricity Costs – Part 4",
    "date": "17-12-2018 01:47:00 PM",
    "content": "In the first article of the four-part series we looked at how the cheapest electricity is the electricity that you do not use and the many opportunities to capture the low hanging fruit of energy efficiencies. In the second article we looked at how savings can be achieved through purchasing electricity at wholesale market pool prices and then achieving further savings by employing Demand Side Management or Demand Response strategies. In the third article we looked how large innovative energy users are locking in long-term electricity prices at well below current market prices through using Corporate PPAs. In this (possibly) final article we will look at the power of analysing your electricity usage data to understand where and when you use electricity so that you can identify cost saving opportunities. The article is based on Step 2 (Chapter 9) of the 9-Step electricity cost reduction framework covered in my book “ Power Profits – A Comprehensive 9-Step Framework for Reducing Electricity Costs and Boosting Profits ” . It’s critical to fully understand how electricity is used in your business. You need to be able to thoroughly and accurately answer questions such as: What time of day, day of week, and month of year is electricity use at its highest and lowest? What is the maximum demand and when does it occur? What drives maximum demand? Which equipment has what load? Which equipment needs to run all of the time? Which equipment does not run at capacity? What is the site power factor? Without knowing these answers, you cannot significantly reduce electricity costs. One of the common mistakes in electricity purchasing is not knowing the electricity usage profile of the operation and not understanding the operational flexibilities of the equipment. Retailers need to make assumptions about your load profile when providing supply offers. Most commonly they use your last 12-months of half-hour interval data to model your annual peak, shoulder and off-peak consumption and their pricing algorithm will be based on that profile. If you expect your load profile to change in the future, or you have the ability to change the profile, then you may be able to achieve sharper prices. Analysing the data If your business is serious about reducing energy costs, then it is important to know how to collate and analyse your energy data. There are all sorts of different techniques you can use to do this. Different analysis techniques will reveal different information, but my favourite method is to use box plots. Box plots The amount of data that is available at the operations level can be overwhelming when it comes to analysing electricity usage. For this reason, one of the best ways to analyse and represent the information and provide some context is to look at box plots for the data. Box plots are a method of representing data that show the distribution of the data at a glance and not just over a time series average. Averages are not very useful when looking at electricity usage data as they obscure crucial information like the highs and the shape of the distribution. Box plots are simple percentile plots where a box represents the 25th to the 75th percentile of the data, and “whiskers” either side indicate the expected variation in the upper and lower quartiles. For most box plots, the upper whisker extends to the highest data value within the upper limit range where the upper limit is 1.5 × the difference between the 25th and 75th percentile added to the 75th percentile. The lower whisker extends to the lowest data value within the equivalent lower limit range. The median, where 50% of the data values are less than or equal to this number, is shown as a horizontal line across the box. We also show the average value in most of the charts as a solid dot with a line connecting them. Data points that sit outside the extent of the whiskers are regarded as outliers and not within the expected distribution. They are due to special cause variation and are often pointers to abnormal operations that are pushing your costs up. The following diagram shows a simple representation of a box plot for a set of data. Figure 1 – Box Plot Interval data Medium to large electricity users will have meters that are read remotely and record the electricity consumption in 30-minute intervals, although sometimes this data will be in 15-minute intervals. This data is known as “interval data”, and each customer can request this data from their retailer or sometimes the network provider. It is common to look at 12 months of interval data, although I would usually analyse 24 months of data to get some more historical context. This is a lot of data. For 12 months this is 365 × 48 data points or 17,520 data points for each field. The data that we need is the time stamp, the kW and the kVA, which gives us 52,560 data points. (The data set that is provided in the interval data actually has more data than this.) We then need to do some calculations and then present the data in a way that can be easily interpreted. In Excel we will calculate the following from the data provided: power factor time of day day of week month of year We then slice and dice the data a few different ways to look under the hood of the business in terms of how it uses electricity in terms of: usage over the long-term trend usage distribution by time of day (separating week days and weekends if appropriate) usage by day of week usage by month of year drilling down to specific days analysing power factor. Run charts I love using box plots, but a simple run chart of half-hour load data can reveal a lot about what is happening at a business in regard to electricity usage patterns. It shows the variability in load, it shows some seasonality, and it also shows step changes. Step changes in load are very important. Often there is a step change in the load upwards and the business has no visibility of that data. Electricity network supply charges may increase by an amount that the accounts payable person doesn’t notice and the responsible manager glosses over. However, when annualised, that amount becomes significant. The below example shows two years of half-hour demand (kVA) data for a chemical manufacturing plant that runs on a 24-hour x 7 day week operation. This business is able to sell everything that it produces and so its profitability is based on maximising run time for as much as the year as possible, with short monthly stops for maintenance. Figure 2 – Run Chart Example The run chart shows a large step up in demand in July 2015 and then a step down again a few months later. The step down, if sustainable, would allow the client to apply to have their network demand charges reduced by $16,623/year. And that’s just from looking at one chart! The cause of the increase in demand was solenoid valves leaking compressed air. This required the second of two large air compressors to be run, pushing up demand. The leakage was known about, recognised, and put on the maintenance plan to repair, but the maintenance team were oblivious to the potential electricity cost impact due to the increase in maximum demand. In South Australia, a step up in the maximum demand will incur higher demand charges every month going forward, even if it was a short-term increase. As it happened, the client was running below their existing fixed network peak demand level setting of 1,070 kVA and their anytime, or off-peak, demand level of 1,123 kVA so the step up would not have incurred additional cost. The $16,623/year cost saving opportunity was in applying for a reduction in Agreed Demand to 946 kVA. However, after making the request to reduce the agreed demand to 946 kVA and realising the network savings, any subsequent large air leaks causing the second compressor to kick in again would have increased their monthly and annual charges without the client even being aware. That is why ongoing monitoring and analysis of the data is critical in maintaining any cost savings achieved. Time-of-day data Run charts are very useful as a first step but looking at usage distributions at different times of day yields other interesting information that can lead to reduced costs. The following box plot chart shows an example of where a time-of-day pattern was revealed with analysis that led to a cost reduction. Figure 3 – Time-of-day Analysis In this case the load was quite modest, but the time-of-day information revealed a cost-saving initiative that was completely unknown. The site is a warehouse and uses very little electricity other than lighting and air conditioning. Every weekday in the late afternoon the demand increased. This load pattern was repeatable irrespective of the season. What was even more unusual is that the increase in demand also coincided with when the employees finished work. When the cause of this increase was investigated it was found that it was the recharging of the electric forklift batteries. All the forklifts were being connected up at the same time at the end of the shift – during peak price periods. The solution to this was to install low-cost timers that delayed charging until the off-peak period and staggered the starts. Day-of-week data Day-of-week data can reveal other patterns that can lead to reduced costs. The following chart shows how day-of-week analysis can highlight what is driving annual demand costs. Figure 4 – Day-of-week Analysis This chart shows that Mondays have a much higher maximum demand than every other day, but the distribution of half-hourly demand was less than any other week day. The factory operates generally five days a week, 24 hours per day, with some occasional market demand catch up on Saturdays. It was quickly realised that the higher demand on Mondays, or Tuesdays if Monday was a public holiday, was driven by starting the factory up after being closed for the weekend. This is evident in the next chart that shows a very high demand between 4:30 am and 7:30 am, followed by a drop-off in demand throughout the morning. Figure 5 – Combining day-of-week and time-of-day analysis In this example the “additional demand” charges were being driven by Mondays. “Additional demand” is the period outside of the “peak demand” period and so has a lower cost. Each Monday morning an employee came in early to start up all of the equipment and heaters after the plant had been off for the weekend. Even though this time was during the off-peak period, it pushed the off-peak demand well above the peak Agreed Demand and resulted in higher additional demand charges. In this case, moderating the plant start up resulted in savings of $5,000 a year, which is substantial for a smaller operation. Another important point is that if the start-up of the plant was delayed until the peak period after 7:00 am then this would push up the more expensive agreed demand charges. So, they were doing the right thing in regard to the timing of the start-up of the plant. Month-of-year data Another pattern analysis that is interesting is month-of-year analysis. Similar to the run chart showing all of the data, this chart simplifies the representation of the data and shows the distribution over each month. Month of year data is important to analyse as it can show longer term trends in electricity usage and demand, seasonal patterns and one-off or repeating problems that are impacting costs. Figure 6 – Monthly Analysis Figure 6 shows half-hourly demand data by month over a 12-month period for a relatively large factory. The data shows a significant spike in demand in December 2015, even though there was nothing unusual in the general distribution. In order to identify the root cause we drilled down into the specific day to see what happened throughout that day, and then examined the operating logs to see what happened in the operations to cause that spike. We also examined the power factor by looking at the relationship between real load (kW) and demand (kVA). The culprit was found to be that the power factor correction capacitors had failed, pushing the demand (kVA) significantly higher for the same load (kW). This failure caused the agreed demand charges in the network tariff to be ratcheted up by more than $60,000 per year! Figure 7 – Power factor analysis In December 2015 the power factor correction capacitor banks failed for several hours pushing the maximum demand up far higher. This was a $60k/year failure that was unrecognised at the time. Power factor correction is a subject for another article, but it is one of the important electricity characteristics of your business that is driving your network costs. The electricity data used in this article was obtained from interval meter historical data for the supply point. It is also possible – and sometimes very important – to monitor real-time load for the site or at the sub-board level within a site. Real-time monitoring allows you to alarm or control abnormal increases in demand such as when there is a problem with the power factor correction. Depending on the network in which your business is located, short-term abnormal spikes in demand can have long lasting effect on your network charges and you may not pick up those increases in your costs. Sub-board monitoring can help to show what individual pieces of equipment or groups of equipment are running at any one time. This information is particularly useful in determining the actual run time of equipment loaded and unloaded, and is an important input into any Demand Response strategy, discussed in the second article of the series , that you may choose to adopt to further reduce your costs. Understanding your electricity profile and usage patterns is an important step in any strategy to reduce electricity costs. Combining operational data analysis and market data analysis using the Global-Roam NEMReview software will give you great insights into opportunities to reduce your costs.

    "title": "Villain #5c – too much focus on COST, not enough focus on VALUE",
    "date": "12-12-2018 12:27:00 PM",
    "content": "It’s been apparent to me for some time that this trip-wire is growing in significance as a Villain that’s working to ensure that this energy transition is taking a much rockier path than should otherwise be the case. Over the weekend, I noticed another round of this sort of announcements: I fully recognize that this (decline in cost) has been a remarkable achievement – however (and this is important) I am increasingly concerned that many see this as the destination and not an interim milestone on a longer, and more significant journey . … or to state another way – we’re well past the time when our focus should have collectively shifted from cost, to a focus on value . (A) Obsessive focus on COST is increasingly dangerous Before a proportion of our readers suffer from apoplexy, let me reiterate that the reduction in cost is a remarkable achievement (notwithstanding some broader confusion about when measures like LCOE are applicable , and when they are not really appropriate as a measure – an example of Villain no4 ) . However, it is clear to me that an ongoing obsessive focus on cost (as the destination ) is going to end up with the industry in a mess. As the technologies for solar PV and wind harvesting grow and mature (with storage technology also on the journey as well), it’s necessary that the market focus of those involved in those technologies also needs to mature . We’ve been increasingly involved with new entrants in helping them focus on the market when ”the rubber’s hit the road” on their projects. This has entailed plenty of conversations – as a result of which it seems to me that there are too many still running around with the mindset of engineers* obsessed with their latest gadget whilst really paying only lip service to what the customer actually values (and in some – quite scary – cases, seeing the CER as the customer). * Full Disclosure – I’m an engineer, so well understand the temptation of the bright shiny new thing. (B) Instead, we need to increasingly focus on VALUE On the upside, we have seen some broader recognition from others in the energy sector that acknowledges the high importance of value . For instance, a few months earlier (at the AFR Energy Summit) a few notes from AEMO CEO Audrey Zibelman’s speech caught my eye, as the notes did talk more about the value side of the equation. Unfortunately (which is what’s causing the concern) is this is still relatively rare. (C) Focus on COST is easy – Understanding VALUE (seems) much more difficult Let’s see if I can explain the reasons for my growing concern – as evidence would suggest that not everyone is currently seeing the same Villain: (C1) A focus on COST is easier (though less-and-less helpful) I can understand some of the reasons why this focus on cost has evolved. Reason #1) A number of years ago, the cost of production from wind and solar generation meant it was not in the ballpark of what was required without significant external support in some form. A focus on cost was necessary in order to achieve the cost reductions necessary for it to be more than a token contribution. That’s quite clearly no longer the case today. Reason #2) I can also understand that many supporting these new technologies feel compelled to get drawn into the shouting match with the “rabid right” of the Emotion-o-meter (though in my view this is probably doing more harm than good, and will increasingly be the case in future) . It’s increasingly become a huge distraction to the maturation process that is essential to keep this energy transition process on the rails. Reason #3) At an individual level, and especially for the engineering types who are heavily involved in new technologies, a focus on COST certainly seems to be easier – because: 3a) The sense is that COST has to do with all the things that seem to be within the entrepreneurs control (“within the fence”, so to speak), whereas 3b) The sense is also that VALUE pertains to all those “more difficult” things (“outside the fence”) like the market, connection points in the grid, and connections standards – and delivering power at the time, and the place, the customer needs it. (C2) A brief analytical exercise I’d suggest a simple arithmetical exercise for our readers – simply nominate a period of time (say the coming week) and keep a tally in two columns: Column #1 – the number of articles, tweets, retweets, comments and so on that you notice about how the COST of supply from renewables has fallen significantly. Column #2 – the number of articles, tweets, retweets, comments and so on that you notice talking more about VALUE. My sense is that Column #1 will have a far longer list than Column #2. (C3) An insular focus leads to conspiracy theories We are seeing it increasingly in conversations we’ve been having (and what we’ve seen written elsewhere): (a) My Marginal Loss Factors have changed significantly, which was not in my business plan → it must be a conspiracy! Alas, no, just physics and Villain no4 (b) I’m being constrained down much more than was in my business plan → it must be a conspiracy! Alas, no, though it will be a big surprise in northern Queensland for some, it would seem (c) My average spot revenue is suffering , and I am seeing more negative prices → who can I blame? Just the “ solar correlation penalty ” and “ wind correlation penalty ” at work. (d) I’m needing to actively manage my solar and/or wind farm projects, even to the extent of establishing a 24 x 7 operations room → Nobody told me, and the cost is not factored into our business case; (e) Those phone calls from other new entrants along the lines of “you can’t expect us to incur the cost of establishing these operations – the rebidding rules are there for the other big, bad generators !” in response to this earlier article that raised some questions. The rules are there for a reason, and apply to all for very valid reasons. the list goes on… For as long as new entrants are led to believe that COST is the number 1 performance metric, we’ll continue seeing these sorts of rude awakenings. It won’t end well, and could be a systemic risk for the energy transition as a whole. (C4) Respected clean energy focal points are a key What triggered me to write this post today was the current round of social media coverage prompted by the Clean Energy Council on the weekend (tweet copied above – at the time of posting today it had 5 replies, 91 retweets and 147 likes ). I understand the popularity – but I also understand that respected industry focal points (like the CEC, the Smart Energy Council, and so on) can play a significant role in re-starting the progression of the broader energy sector up the maturity curve . Lower unit COST of delivery is an interim milestone on the journey to delivering customer VALUE In doing so we’d go a long way to avoiding the bumpy future ride that this energy transition is headed towards.",

    "title": "A brief look at the outlook for QLD region this summer",
    "date": "11-12-2018 02:53:00 PM",
    "content": "Summer’s formally begun 11 days ago – and yet it surprises me to note that this is the first post on WattClarity formally about summer 2018-19. We’ve been too busy in a couple of areas: 1) onboarding a bow wave of new clients (and in some cases providing detailed training about our software and the broader market); 2) compilation of data sets for what might be over 100 metrics for generator performance (on a station-by-station basis) for consideration in our Generator Report Card 2018 ; and 3) some other initiatives to assist new entrants to the energy sector (that are currently flying under the radar) – though we have noted a couple market observations on Twitter and LinkedIn . A conversation this week has prompted me to take a quick look at what’s currently forecast for the Queensland region over the coming summer/Q1 period – and we will (as in prior years) try to ensure we post quick analysis of interesting events as they occur. (A) Forecast for QLD, using AEMO data Using the web-based Trend Engine within the ez2view software, I’ve put together a mash-up of actual supply/demand data plus AEMO’s forecasts from ST PASA and MT PASA out till 31st March 2019. This currently looks as follows: Licensed users of ez2view can access a copy of this trend here , and then continue to develop their own analysis. Of interest is the single day forecast for the day that schools are back in January where there is a non-zero Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) – though note that this is still quite low and (as with much of what AEMO does in the forecasting space) intended to elicit a market response. We’ll watch that one with interest as summer rolls through…. (B) Something else to watch – via the Fair Work Commission Also, for those unaware, it might also be worth noting some specific questions in these “Protection Action Ballots” at the Fair Work Commission in relation to a number of unions lined up in concert against Stanwell Corporation. I found the following actions of particular interest: Question 12: For an unlimited number of periods of one or more hours duration reducing the megawatt rate of change to 3.0 megawatts per minute on all in service units? Question 18: The imposition of an unlimited number of bans of one or more hours duration, on the operation of one or more of the generators at the Tarong Power Stations to generate more than 180 megawatts of power output per generator? I did have a question about “why Tarong?” given that the Stanwell portfolio is broader than that – however it’s possible that the 5-unit site was selected for greatest leverage in the negotiations between the unions and management. For those not so familiar with the numbers, limiting output from a Tarong units to 180MW would reduce available supply by approximately 200MW – hence by a total of about 1,000MW across all 5 units if taken coincidentally. Compare that with a QLD region “back of the envelope” surplus forecast in the MT PASA run of 1,700MW or so (not including interconnector flow and so on). In particular these actions (if taken) could make that LOLP figure in late January much higher indeed . The details of the ballots from the relevant unions were all provided on the FWC website – and I found the details of interest in a number of respects. The union ballots are here: 1) 54 employees registered with the CEPU (of which 72% voted ) 2) 42 employees registered with the CFMMEU (of which 69% voted ) 3) 22 employees registered with the ASU (of which 64% voted ) 4) 21 employees registered with the AMWU (of which 57% voted ) 5) 7 employees registered with the APESMA (of which 1 person voted ) 6) 1 employee registered with the AIMPE ( who voted ) ————————– Assuming no person is members of more than one union, that means 147 employees members of unions at Stanwell (of which 95 employees voted for the right to take action, such as in those 2 questions above). A useful comparison to Stanwell’s Annual Report for 2017-18 which notes total employee numbers at 685 : as at 30 June 2018; and across multiple sites (including Tarong site, which features in some of the questions on the ballot for reasons I have not time to delve much into). Hence, unless my calculations are in error, it seems that: there is 21% coverage of total employee numbers within Stanwell Corporation by union membership (not sure how that compares with other organisations in the energy sector?) there were 14% of total employee numbers within Stanwell Corporation voted (not all of them YES, though the vast majority) for the right to take industrial action that would have a significant impact on (price, and possible security of supply) in the Queensland region, and possibly broader across much of the NEM (depending on when, and what action). Unless I’ve made an arithmetical error, there’s something that does not seem to add up here, in terms of (over-sized?) leverage based on votes from 95 people. Another point of interest as summer rolls through in Queensland",

    "date": "07-12-2018 01:55:00 PM",
    "content": "The growth of Large Solar in the NEM has been phenomenal, and a sign that things are changing quickly in the Australian energy industry. The chart attached is the maximum output of each region from Large Solar installations on a weekly basis. At the start of 2018 output was 280 MW across all regions: Almost all of this was from NSW at Nyngan, Moree, Broken Hill and Royalla; Qld had two solar farms in Barcaldine (20 MW) and Kidston which at the time was only generating 10 MW. In March, generation from Kidston increased to 45 MW. By April Clare started generating and by August there were poles firmly planted in the ground, on a dozen sites with a capacity of 600 MW. But Queensland was not the only bright spot! NSW saw Parkes, Griffith and Dubbo, as well as Coleambally by September and then a few weeks later so did Griffith. Current generation from solar in NSW is now just over 500 MW. Both Victoria and South Australia had no generation from Large Scale Solar at the start of 2018: they are now generating 130 and 180 MW respectively. As of early December, at the time of writing this article, generation from large scale solar in the mainland regions of the NEM are up to 1500 MW. That’s more than a 400% increase from the start of the year. The look ahead beyond 2019 as displayed on the above graph is based on data on AEMO’s Generation Information Page; and only on those that have a status of “Committed” or “Com*”. Some of these projects have likely been affected by the collapse of engineering company RCR, and so the assumption that there may be delays on many projects currently being built or in the stages of commissioning, the potential pipeline of projects is still significant. We have assumed that there will be no generation until February 2019 for Qld projects about to come on line. The question that a lot of people have asked is how will this extra generation affect the electricity market and there are many different ways to answer that which we won’t do today. However, we also want to posit a slightly different question– how will all these new solar generators be impacted by the ever-changing and dynamic electricity market?

    "title": "Crunch Coming–oversupply in northern Queensland?",
    "date": "08-11-2018 07:54:00 AM",
    "content": "From a (rare) post focused on some very micro details back to a macro view of the NEM…. We’re seeing a number of new entrant generators coming onboard with us, for a range of reasons. In this process, we have spoken more broadly with a range of new entrants (all of whom we’re starting to track in our Generator Catalog , for instance). In these conversations some specific questions about the supply/demand balance for northern Queensland , have arisen – particularly in terms of what is likely to occur with respect to: 1) changes in Marginal Loss Factors , 2) Reduced output due to constraints/congestion , and 3) Pricing impacts, due to the wind / solar correlation penalty . … altogether a trio of possible effects that have the potential to significantly change the economics of a growing number of projects. (A) What we’ve noticed in passing We believe in the power of dashboards to help people progressively gain exposure to, and understanding of, the growing complexities in the energy sector. That’s why we have developed a number of these, looking at different aspects of this complexity. With our ez2view higher-end dashboard, we have noticed a number of instances such as that captured in the following image, where Queensland power stations have been “constrained down” due to a range of different conditions. Here’s one instance we captured back at 13:05 on 12th September 2018 whilst discussing being constrained down with a particular new entrant: In this particular case, we saw that the constraint driving the curtailment was one that affected many stations across Queensland (i.e. in this case the stations with “+” symbols are being constrained down, as the constraint is of the form Left-Hand Side ≤ Right Hand Side: In future, we suspect that there will be an increasing number of instances where it’s just generation plant in northern Queensland that will suffer from the being constrained down, through different constraint equations – partly for transient reasons, but also (more generally) because the rate of development in norther Queensland looks likely to swamp the size of the “addressable market” at different points in time. I’ve mentioned this in these conversations, and have been asked to explain further – hence this post. (B) Assessing the “addressable market” size from supply in northern Queensland Out of curiosity a while back, I accessed a 22 month history of Powerlink “QData” (which we make available to ez2view clients as an optional extra in their data feed in collaboration with Powerlink). Returning to this data set (in between other commitments) I’ve been having a look at two different parameters that should, combined, give some gauge to what the “addressable market” would be for all generators located in northern Queensland. B1) Aggregate Demand in northern Queensland With reference to the “Queensland schematic” widget in the ez2view snapshots above, we see that there are three distinct Zones within the Queensland region that, when combined, would constitute northern Queensland: 1) A “Far North” zone, which encompasses the area around Cairns; 2) A “Ross” zone, which encompasses the area around Townsville, and the load on the grid that spreads west from that point from Powerlink substations in the area; and 3) A “North” zone, which encompasses the area around Mackay, including the mining loads connected into those substations. For each of these zones, Powerlink provide snapshots every minute (bundled in 5 minute updates) of the “demand” being supplied from collections of substations in these zones. Notwithstanding the numerous complexities that go with measuring electricity demand , we aggregated these 3 zonal demand numbers at each minute over the 22 month time range to form a view of what the demand for electricity might be, roughly speaking, in northern Queensland. Here’s a sample of the data for a 2 week period in January 2017, to help readers understand this data set ( in blue ) along with the second one (in orange, discussed in the section below): In this chart, we see that the demand oscillates around the 1,000MW mark, with (over this period) not much difference seen on the weekends compared to the week days (not much difference even on 1st January). We presume this is because of the high degree of temperature-driven consumption, and higher degree of tourism-driven consumption than for Queensland as a whole. Taking the whole 22 month sample set and forming a distribution chart, we see the following: As noted on the chart, for 77% of the time, demand in northern Queensland was less than 1,000MW and above 650MW. On this basis, we feel justified in making a simplifying (perhaps quite generous) assumption that the addressable local market for generators in northern Queensland of 1,000MW – though obviously many times it will be less than that (by time of day, and season, etc…) B2) Export Capability south from northern Queensland Historically, because of a deficit of local low-cost generation sources in northern Queensland, power has typically flowed north – from the “Central-West” zone (i.e. around Rockhampton) up the northern Queensland. Via the Powerlink Qdata set, we accessed a 22 month history of these flows. A sample ( in orange ) is shown in the trend chart above. Hypothetically in future, with an influx of large volumes of low cost generation in northern Queensland, the flows might reverse (i.e. and see northern Queensland exporting at similar volumes south). Note that there are important simplifying assumptions made here for the sake of this analysis , which include: 1) The assumption that there would not also be similar expansion of low cost generation in central Queensland (this seems unlikely, but let’s assume this for now); and 2) We also assume that the transfer capacity south is about as much as it has been north. We have not taken the time to investigate this at all in this “back of an envelope” calculation. Taking the same historical data set and performing a similar distribution analysis (remembering that negative flows are south-to-north) we see the following trend: As noted on the chart we see that (noting a few small gaps in the data) there was not a single 1-minute instance where electricity transferred from North to Central Queensland over the 22 month date range – however this is understandable, given the large share of lower-cost generation that has been deployed in central Queensland historically (Callide, Stanwell and Gladstone power stations), and the dearth of the same in northern Queensland. Of course, in the new energy environment that we are heading into through this energy transition , it is one possible outcome (of many) that the relative share of low-cost generation sources might reverse, such that northern Queensland would see a preponderance of wind and solar assets being built. In order to continue this back-of-the-envelope calculation, we feel we can make another simplifying assumption that there could be (if economics warranted it) a transfer of 1,000MW south (from northern Queensland to central Queensland). B3) Rough estimate of total addressable market for generators in northern QLD Adding together the two numbers, we conclude that a back-of-the-envelope assumption suggests that the maximum market size that could be addressed by all the generators in northern Queensland would be 2,000MW (as a nice round number) – being the demand locally in the area, plus the limit on flow capacity south. Obviously this could be refined in more detail, but seems fair enough as an initial guide for these purposes. (C) Assessing what it means for the future “What this means for the future” is, of course, the multi-million dollar question for new project proponents. Because of our heightened interest in generation projects under development (at least in part because we’re tracking them more closely through our Generator Catalog ) we have taken more of a look at the types of plant that are under development in northern Queensland. C1) Existing (and under construction) assets in northern QLD Sourcing data from this Generator Catalog, we have compiled this table of plant that are operating, or under construction and soon to begin operations: Whilst we see there is more than 2,000MW in aggregate capacity, it is the aggregate capacity of more than 1,000MW across the large-scale solar plant that stands out particular to me. The solar is of particular interest as its output will all be highly correlated – so an output peaking above 1,000MW in the middle of a sunny summers day, where we have also seen (above) that the peak demand locally would be only around the same level. The significant revisions to Marginal Loss Factors ( discussed here ) seems an obvious outcome of this re-balancing that is already with us. And it does not even consider other projects on the drawing board… C2) Some prospective plant From our Generator Catalog, we have dragged out some details of a sample of the other projects that are under consideration for northern Queensland by various developers: Just looking at the solar PV projects in the (incomplete) listing above, we see over 3,000MW of potential addition to the 1,000MW of solar projects already operational, or soon to be. Based on the back-of-the-envelope calculation above on the size of the addressable market from supply location in northern Queensland, clearly there is a mismatch! (D) What a generator in northern Queensland might do, to improve their prospects Unfortunately, prior conversations with some developers of assets in northern Queensland suggest that this assessment will be a bit of a shock to them, which is a concern (and evidence of Villain #4 at work). An obvious next question to ask is what a developer, or operator of an existing asset in northern Queensland, might do to give their project a larger chance of success. D1) Jump on the “storage” bandwagon? Of course, there will be some who immediately leap to “storage” being the answer (as it it were some form of magic wand cure-all). However whilst it will offer some assistance, it is important to note that the total addressable market (as calculated above) peaks at 2,000MW including exports, so just adding storage with all of the development above would seem to just end up with storages being filled to overflowing, with no way to market to discharge into. D2) Upgrade the interconnector transfer? Upgrading export capacity to other markets (e.g. upgrading transfer capacity south, or connecting westwards to Mt Isa and beyond) would also be worthy of serious consideration (including the implications of RIT-T and so on) – but a note of caution, that “interconnection” does not also become an alternative magic wand. D3) Increase local consumption! This is certainly something that would help. Finding additional customers locally (particularly large energy users) would definitely help to increase the addressable market size from generation options in the north. It is with a note of irony that we could point out that one of the market developments that would assist with the returns generated by Adani’s new Rugby Run Solar Farm (amongst others in the region), would be for an increase in mining load to come about from opening of new mining loads in the Galilee Basin, including the much-hated Adani mine there. D4) Create a new NEM region for Northern Queensland Something a bit more left-field would be to consider the creation of a “Northern Queensland” region. Being a separate region might accelerate the process of attracting new energy users to the north. Let’s be clear – initially what would happen if this were to come about would be that prices in the new “Northern Queensland” region would most likely plunge most of the time – beset heavily by a heavy solar correlation penalty . However this change should stimulate much more rapid development of major energy users in the region, to reset the balance between supply and demand to more sustainable levels. Ideally these would be loads that could operate diurnally , given that this is likely to be the periods where (in the absence of the additional cost of storage) generation will be surplus. Finding loads that were heavy consumers but which did not need to operate 24×7 would be an interesting challenge… More detail in upcoming “Generator Report Card” It’s these types of conversations that have been one of the reasons prompting us to develop an extensive Generator Report Card with data till 31st December 2018. In the report card, we are working to include analysis for each of the many power stations across the the NEM trending the amount of time with which a generator has been constrained, how their loss factor has changed, and the average spot revenue per MWh produced has changed in the presence of any “correlation penalty”.",

    "date": "08-11-2018 07:47:00 AM",
    "content": "Back in mid-2017, I spoke at Clean Energy Summit 2017 and provided a forecast of sorts (for train wreck underway) . Since that time I have been progressively posting more about a Listing of Villains that I spoke about at the time – and which we see at work in helping our complex energy transition run off the rails: Villain #1 First and foremost, I see the long-running failure of our “ emperors with no clothes ” as a huge (and perhaps the biggest) driver of our energy transition train wreck … Villain #2 … however our political class have been aided and abetted by us, the voting public , in that we have been seemingly unable to deliver stable support for the complexities inherent in such a large transformation … Villain #3 Both politicians and public alike have been pulled from both extremes by an increasingly loud shouting match that’s emerged across both extremes of the Emotion-o-meter . Villain #4 With participants at all points on that scale (including us as a company, and yours truly) suffering from the yawning gap that’s emerging between required and current “Energy Literacy” . Villain #5 We see a number of instances where there seems to have been a tendency of not focusing on the real problems at hand . Today ( with this post ) I note one of the other tendencies we’re seeing – one that is, at the same time, both: 1) A very understandable human trait in dealing with rapidly increasing complexity (and hence the emergence of Villain #4); but 2) Not helpful – especially when we don’t realise we’re doing it. All too frequently, over the years, have we seen people reach for some kind of “Magic wand” as a form of cure-all to the vexed challenges we face in the energy sector. “when one has a hammer, every problem begins to look like a nail” We’ve sometimes caught ourselves tempted to do the same thing ourselves. No doubt, there are other times where we have slipped up and allowed such thinking to propagate into our analysis and commentary – and potentially in our software products as well. My sense is that this propensity is not isolated to any particular point of the Emotion-o-meter – though the particular choice of magic wand does seem to be. It’s also important to note that the core piece of technology (or process) that has increasingly been appropriated as a magic wand does have some inherent value. It seems to us that the problems begin when this “thing” becomes abstracted away from its pros (and its cons) to be seen as a cure for all ills. I’ll start this post off today by noting a couple examples of how we’ve been seen to exhibit this sort of behaviour with respect to the energy sector transition . As time permits, I’ll post separately about other examples, and link them into the table below… Date added Example of Villain #6 Brief discussion Initial (Thu 8th Nov 2018) An obsession about “Base Load” The term “baseload” seems to have taken on almost mythical, magical qualities in recent years – representing (to some) all that would serve to fix the current train wreck unfolding in the energy sector, or (to others) representing all that ails the same energy sector. With such a complex problem set (and an almost inevitably complex solution required as a result), resolving either of these to a simplistic label does not seem to be helping us in either case. Let’s call this instance Villain 6a . Initial (Thu 8th Nov 2018) Latching onto “Storage” as a magic cure-all Another case we are bumping into frequently is a tendency for some to wave the “storage is the solution” magic wand – without considering the pros and cons . Let’s call this instance Villain 6b . Tue 5th March 2019 Believing that “Demand Response” is a cure to any gap in the supply-demand balance in your model In conjunction with these more general thoughts about the AEMC’s latest deliberations about ways to promote a more active and responsive demand side of the electricity supply/demand balance, I posted about the propensity by some to assume “Demand Response” can paper over any gap between supply/demand in their model . Let’s call this instance Villain 6c . Sun 24th May 2020 A simplistic belief that “Diversity will cure it all” in relation to extremes in variability After touching on this topic numerous times in various articles, I was finally prompted to contribute this short article about how reaching for a simplistic belief of ‘diversity will cure it’ is not going to help us actually make the energy transition succeed. Let’s call this instance Villain 6d . ——– It’s worth noting, however, that others at the ‘rabid right’ end of the Emotion-o-meter (themselves very much also Villains) seem to naively clutch onto the notion that diversity is of no use whatsoever … Later More to come… We’ll add more examples later… I’m sure that some of our readers will have encountered other examples of how Villain #6 has manifest itself in the energy sector through this transition process. Feel free to add your examples as comments below, or provide us your feedback directly/confidentially – or just give us a call !",

    "title": "What’s the impact of rooftop solar PV on local distribution network voltage–and its significance?",
    "date": "05-11-2018 12:42:00 PM",
    "content": "We had a bit of a “domestic energy” focus over the weekend, whilst the mercury climbed . Shopping around I lost a few hours “shopping around” again to see if there were cheaper options for gas at home. That’s time I’ll never get back, getting into the detail of daily charges and (with some retailers) declining block tariffs for what seemed, at the end, to offer about $40 cost saving on a $1000 annual spend. A pretty low hourly rate ROI (not even counting going through the transfer process), and time I won’t get back – but that’s food for another post. Also on the weekend, we replaced another LED downlight in our house as it had decided it did not want to work any more. This is becoming quite an annoying practice , because: 1) we have something like 63 of these in ceilings through the house – some in quite hard to access locations, and sprung-loaded in ceilings that are not going to take kindly to repeated prizing out for replacement (i.e. we need to replace the whole light fitting, rather than just a bulb); 2) part of the justification for installing them was the promise that they would “last for 10 years”, and yet I have already replaced 10-20 of them over the 5-year period from 2013 to 2018 (hence I feel like we’ve been sold a dud on the longevity front); 3) I do miss the simplicity of the bayonet/screw style replacement of the old light bulbs, and really don’t fancy having to do this kind of thing on the current frequency (or higher) into the future… This irritation (and curiosity sparked by Tristan’s article last week here and elsewhere – and some reaction to it) prompted me to dive into my Solar Analytics account for our residential rooftop PV power station (see earlier thoughts posted here a year ago ) in order to access measured voltage levels at home. Knowing that we were experiencing problems with blown LEDs I had opted for the higher subscription level from Solar Analytics because: 1) I had been told by a number of electrically-minded people that they suspected high voltage as the reason our lights are blowing; and 2) Our solar , and that from neighbouring houses, might be a driver for higher voltages; 3) It’s been stated elsewhere that local DNSPs (Energex, in our case) don’t have much visibility of what happens in their network below the zone substation; hence 4) I wanted to access a trend of voltage over time in order that I could see what it actually has been – and then 5) From this basis, help me understand if there was something we could do to significantly reduce the expiration rate of LEDs . In this brief post, I take the analysis as far as I am able (technically, I’m out of my depth here) in the hope that some more knowledgeable readers can help me out by helping me understand – with an explanation that’s low on the lingo, and also minimally influenced by either extreme of the Emotion-o-meter . My Solar Analytics account allows me to download data by month, so I grabbed what was there for October 2018 – being the most recent one, and with the latest LED having gone kaput during the month (I think it was 20th or 21st October – it was certainly at night ). The file I downloaded had data for 6 different “channels” (not sure if that is the correct term), with MIN and MAX voltage supplied for each of them. Not knowing any better, I chose the 1st channel (which our helpful installer at Positronic had labelled “PV_Site_Net”), and trended both MIN and MAX voltages over the period up until the end of Sunday 21st October: Because I was interested in the correlation between local voltage and solar output, I have also annotated the chart with the daily production from our PV array. With a mental note to self that “correlation does not necessarily mean causation”, there does seem to be a fair degree of correlation between solar output and local voltage – as in: 1) Voltage consistently seems to dip overnight and rise through the day; and 2) Days where solar output was highest seem to be days where (both MAX and MIN) voltage trended highest during daylight hours. What I don’t know are the following: Question 1 = does higher solar output drive voltage higher? Question 2 = what’s the voltage supposed to be? i.e. I have had 240V stuck in my head from decades ago, but Tristan’s article (which references this University of NSW conference paper ) suggests that voltages in Queensland were supposed to be lowered to 230V Question 3 = does higher voltage have implications for applicances at home (and, in particular, with my failing LEDs)? Question 4 = if so, what can I do about this? I’ll look forward to hearing back from those who can help me with this",

    "title": "Hot weather in Queensland to drive Electricity Demand high this week (and warning of LOR2 Low Reserve Condition)",
    "date": "04-11-2018 12:06:00 PM",
    "content": "It’s heating up in Brisbane again today, with the temperature already showing above 30 degrees where we live. The next three days are forecast to be up at 33 degrees. Given our ongoing interest in understanding the details of electricity demand (notwithstanding all these complexities about how to measure it, and what “it” actually means ), I took a quick look at the current state of Scheduled Demand via NEM-Watch v10 and see Scheduled Demand in Queensland currently quite low – which is not surprising as: 1) It’s a Sunday; and 2) The injections of rooftop PV are cranked up today – which are acting to reduce Scheduled Demand: In the snapshot, I have also highlighted a Market Notice referencing a forecast LOR2 Low Reserve Condition on Tuesday evening 16:00-18:00 NEM time (which also happens to be Brisbane time), which is at the tail end of the day as the solar injections are declining markedly. Here’s the text of the market notice: Opening up a pre-prepared trended view of supply and demand over a 14 day period for Queensland via ez2view online , we see that (currently) the Queensland Operational Demand is forecast to be as high as 8,800MW on Tuesday evening – which would be the highest we’ve seen it reach since last summer: Licensed users of ez2view can access a live updating view of this trend here . Note that, even at this level, it would still be more than 1,000MW below the all-time maximum. Finally, pulling in some snapshots from the “Forecast Convergence” widget in my installed copy of ez2view , I see that the AEMO’s forecast of Scheduled Demand for Tuesday evening has been progressively climbing to the current point in time (i.e. to the forecast last published Sunday 10:00): In this widget we use colour thermalling to highlight ( with red ) the areas of most interest/concern – in this case the evening peaks in demand on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: Flipping the layer in Forecast Convergence we can also look at forecast Surplus Generation for the Queensland region (from successive ST PASA forecasts): In this case, the colours are inverted – with red still highlighting the areas of most interest/concern, which are in this case the lowest numbers. As per the annotation, we see that the forecast surplus generation in QLD for Tuesday evening is now looking not as critical as it was in the forecast from 16:00 yesterday (Saturday): 1) We note that the forecast demand has continued to climb; but 2) This means that there must have been additional dispatchable generation capacity made available for the (escalating) demand peak on Tuesday. 3) Flipping Forecast Convergence to Available Generation confirms this (again, red is “bad” ): This is the sort of response that the AEMO Market Notices warning of LOR conditions are supposed to elicit. We will watch with interest to see if more is forthcoming, as the LOR2 forecast is still current.",

    "title": "Too much solar? For whom exactly?",
    "date": "30-10-2018 01:49:00 PM",
    "content": "Anarchy – it’s a strong word. When used to describe the conditions surrounding an electricity system, as it was by the Energy Security Board Chair Kerry Schott, it is especially worrying. I reckon anarchy is something you really can’t afford to have when it comes to the power system. If the power system isn’t kept in control then people can die, lots of expensive equipment could be damaged, the economy could come to a grinding halt and God forbid we might even be unable to watch Netflix and have to talk to our loved ones. According to media reports Kerry Schott used the word anarchy in describing the rapid uptake that has been occurring with rooftop solar in this country. She’s not the only one complaining of there being far too much solar energy coming into the system. Over the last few weeks there have been number of reports in the media that grid is on the verge of hitting too much solar energy. The Age reported on concerns by electricity retailer-generators where they were predicting Australia, “could become the first country in the world where the grid cannot handle the excess level of distributed electricity generated”. According to these electricity industry executives we are on the verge of a “solar peak” – a point at which “there is no point in putting any more solar power into the system” because it will just be spilled and wasted. Worse it might even cause blackouts. Andrew Dillion, head of the Energy Networks Association told the ABC’s 7.30 report, “If there is too much energy coming back up the system in the middle of the day it can cause either frequency, voltage disturbances in the system which will lead to transformers and other equipment tripping off to protect themselves from being damaged and that will cause localised blackouts.” This is all coming within the context of a furious battle over a recommendation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that in 2021 the Federal Government should remove the rebate provided to solar systems under the Small Scale Renewable Energy Scheme. So are we faced with a serious problem of there being too much solar and does that mean we should scrap the rebate? This comes down to really two separate issues I’ll examine in this article: Macro-level: Are we at risk of generating more solar than we have demand for at an overall wholesale market generation level? Micro-level: Are we at risk of overloading the distribution network down at the local distribution transformer level where the systems are installed on homes and businesses? Then there’s also an issue about do we care about the dangers to our children and others around the world from global warming, and is this solar rebate a worthwhile expenditure to address these dangers? Before getting into the detail over whether or not we’re on the verge of too much solar we should quickly cover off on this issue over whether the SRES rebate is worthwhile expenditure in terms of carbon abatement. It turns out that the recently awarded Nobel Prize for Economics went to a person who could shed light on this topic – Professor William Nordhaus. I happen to think his work involved a range of flaws which meant his economic analysis tended to seriously underestimate or ignore substantial risks associated with global warming, but let’s put that aside for one moment. According to Nordhaus’s 2017 paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2020 the economic benefit from avoiding a tonne of CO2 being emitted to the atmosphere was about $58. By comparison the SRES solar rebate would deliver this abatement at a cost of $26 in 2021 – the date it was recommended to be abolished by the ACCC. For those who point to carbon trading as a potentially more efficient mechanism, yes I agree with you. But firstly, you might like to get such a measure implemented before you scrap existing policy mechanisms that deliver abatement at lower cost than the economic benefits they provide. Are we at risk of generating more solar than we have demand for at an overall wholesale market generation level? Well certainly not today. Solar reached its peak level of penetration or market share in December last year. The chart below illustrates the sources of power generation across the National Electricity Market across the whole of December. The troughs are generally about 2am to 4pm, while the peaks tend to be between 12 noon and 4pm (all in NEM time which is eastern standard time without daylight savings). It shows pretty clearly that we were in no danger whatsoever of solar generating more electricity than we can consume. Solar – shown in yellow – is simply knocking off the top of the peaks in demand that would otherwise be serviced by what has become quite expensive, and hard to secure gas. Generation over time by fuel type across the December 2017 period Source: Green Energy Markets analysis based on NEMreview data So let’s zoom forward to 2021 when the ACCC recommended that the solar SRES rebate should be abolished. Firstly, there’s going to be a lot more large scale solar farms in place, not just rooftop solar. According to Green Energy Market’s power plant database, projects under construction or contracted will lift large scale solar capacity to more than 5000MW. These will generate around 12,000GWh per year. We’ve allocated that generation across 30 minute time intervals according to the 2017-18 generation patterns of a combination of Nyngan, Broken Hill, Moree and Royalla. Given these projects are all in NSW it won’t be a perfect representation of the far broader geographical distribution of Australia’s solar farms but should give us a reasonable idea. In terms of rooftop solar, according to the Australian Energy Market Operator these solar systems are projected to generate 13,419 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 2020-21. That’s up on 2017-18 levels by 85%. So as an approximation let’s lift the NEM’s rooftop solar’s output by 85% across each 30 minute timeframe. The chart below details how December 2017 would have looked with this extra solar assuming that it displaces gas in the first instance (because it is an expensive fuel) and then black coal. Generation over time overlaying 2021 levels of solar on December 2017 demand and solar conditions. Source: Green Energy Markets analysis based on NEMreview data We can see that solar is now one of the largest sources of power during daylight periods. Between 9am and 5pm solar represents a quarter of the NEM’s power supply during this December period, and it peaks as high as 43%. But we are a very long way from having so much solar that it exceeds available demand. Instead what it is doing is driving black coal down to similar levels which it regularly reaches during night time periods. If we extend our gaze to look at the impact of the extra solar over average patterns seen across each quarter of last financial year we can see more clearly that what solar will do is create a second off-peak period for the wholesale electricity market. 2017-18 National Electricity Market generation by time of day and fuel type after superimposing 2021 levels of solar capacity Source: Green Energy Markets analysis based on NEMreview data Essentially, between 10am and 2pm solar will carve out a remaining amount of demand for other generators down to levels typically seen over 2am to 4am at night. Now it just happens that this probably won’t be much fun for those owners of electricity generators who seem to be complaining about too much solar. This is because historically between 2am to 4am at night power prices dip down dramatically, as we can see very clearly in the chart below. Average wholesale spot market prices by state by time of day 2015-2018 Source: Green Energy Markets analysis based on NEMreview data It’s worth noting this also happens to be bad news for all those householders that have been rushing out to install solar systems. This is because the average solar system being installed on residential rooftops these days has become quite large. 6.6 kilowatts has become the defacto standard and such a system could be expected to export about 70-90% of its output. Those exports can only be expected to receive the average going wholesale market price of electricity. But, contrary to the suggestions of some, such as the Grattan Institute, this certainly isn’t a problem for electricity consumers more generally. In fact, it’s great news for them. Especially those that may be likely to occupy their home over daytime periods such as pensioners, the unemployed and those with young children – but only if they take advantage of time of use tariffs. Are we at risk of overloading the distribution network down at the local distribution transformer level leading to blackouts? The computer says no. That would be the computer in your solar inverter. Now it is true that solar systems, by injecting power into the network do act to lift voltages in the local area in which they are installed. But you needn’t worry about it overloading local distribution transformers, causing them to trip-off and cause blackouts. The output of solar systems are controlled by an inverter which continuously monitors the voltage of the network. In circumstances where the voltage is getting close to levels that networks deem too high, the solar system will either cycle its output or shut it off completely to prevent driving up voltage any further. But there’s something else you should be aware of: voltages on our electricity networks are being run at levels far above where they should be, which is 230 volts. University of NSW researchers , using 2000 Solar Analytics devices that monitor voltage in households across the states of SA, Victoria, NSW and Queensland found that the typical voltage on the network tends to be close to 245 Volts whether its day or night-time. They are only operating close to the standard of 230 volts for less than 1% of the time. This might be understandable in Queensland, which has only just recently adjusted its standard down to 230 volts, but for the other states this standard has been in place for a long time. In fact Standards Australia agreed a plan to move Australia from 240 Volts to 230 Volts back in 1983. If the networks adjusted the voltage settings of their transformers to the standard they are supposed to be adhering to, then we should be able to absorb substantially greater amounts of solar capacity in the network without voltages exceeding levels we’ve found to be perfectly acceptable to power our appliances for decades. Below I’ve provided a chart from the UNSW research on duration of different voltages they found on Victorian distribution networks for daylight and non daylight hours. The first thing to note is that the median for voltage lies substantially above 230 volts and it is incredibly rare that voltages are close to 230 volts. The second thing that’s very interesting is that voltages during night time are actually higher than they are during daytime when solar is generating. This is because voltage is also influenced by how much electricity demand is on the network (higher demand generally leads to lower voltage) and demand is generally lower over the non-daylight periods. Victorian voltage distribution – daylight and non-daylight periods Source: Stringer, Bruce and MacGill (2017) Now in the case of South Australia which has substantially greater solar penetration, voltages are skewed to be slightly higher during daylight hours rather than night time. However, you can also see that if we shifted the base settings toward 230 Volts then the highest voltages would be closer to where the median is at present, while the distribution would still rarely fall below 220 volts – which is what appliances across many parts of Europe regularly operate at without problems. South Australian voltage distribution Source: Stringer, Bruce and MacGill (2017) So are we on the verge of too much solar? Probably yes if you’re the existing owner of an electricity generator, but probably not for everyone else. And certainly not if you happen to be concerned about global warming.

    "title": "How To Reduce Electricity Costs – Part 3",
    "date": "29-10-2018 12:40:00 PM",
    "content": "In the first article of the four-part series we looked at how the cheapest electricity is the electricity that you do not use and the many opportunities to capture the low hanging fruit of energy efficiencies. In the second article we looked at how savings can be achieved through purchasing electricity at wholesale market pool prices and then achieving even further savings by employing Demand Side Management or Demand Response strategies. In this article we will look another supply arrangement that is increasingly being used by large businesses to reduce the cost of purchased electricity at well below the standard retail fixed prices. This supply arrangement is called the Corporate Power Purchase Agreement or Corporate PPA and it offers businesses the opportunity to lock in prices at or below the current market price for a long-term period. The article is an expansion on Chapter 13 (Step 6) and Chapter 15 (Step 8) of my book “ Power Profits – A Comprehensive 9-Step Framework for Reducing Electricity Costs and Boosting Profits ” . Traditionally, retailers contract with generators, who may be the same company, for the supply of blocks of electricity in the future which they then sell to end user customers through standard retail contracts. These blocks of electricity are often in the form of a strip of Over-The-Counter Swaps which are contracts for the purchase of a fixed volume of electricity for a specific period at a fixed price in the future. For example, a Swap for a block of electricity could be 1 MW for Quarter 1 in 2019. This means the contract is for the purchase and sale of 1MW per hour for 90-days or 2,160 MWhs. In simple terms, the retailer would contract for a strip, or series, of Swaps to cover their requirements for the supply to a portfolio of end users. In reality it gets more sophisticated than this with peak and off-peak contracts, price cap contracts, options and other derivatives. For the purpose of this article we will assume the simplest case. The Swap is a financial derivative and not a contract for the actual supply of electricity. There is a cash flow between the generator and the retailer based on the face value of the Swap and the underlying wholesale market price. If the wholesale market price is higher than the Swap price, then the generator pays the difference to the retailer. If the wholesale price is lower than the Swap price, then the retailer pays the difference to the generator. If the prices are the same, then there is no net cash flow. There is usually a daily settlement throughout the term of the Swap based on daily movements in the wholesale market price. This form of contract is known as a Contract-For-Difference or CFD. It allows the generator to receive a known fixed price in the future for a volume of generation irrespective of the underlying wholesale market price. Similarly, it allows the retailer to purchase a fixed volume for a known price in the future which is then passed on to end users along with a set of risk premiums, other costs and its own profit margin. In summary: Swap – contract between retailer and generator for fixed volume and fixed price Contract-For-Difference CFD – the structure of a Swap – there is a cash flow between the two parties reflecting the difference between the face value of the contract and the wholesale market price Retail contract – contract between customer and retailer for variable volume (within limits) and fixed price Wholesale market – the electricity market where a variable price is determined for each half-hour based on end user demand and the electricity generation bid stack to meet that demand The simplified relationships between the end user, retailer, generator and the market are shown in Figure 1. It is much more complex than this with market intermediaries and a financial settlement clearing house also involved. Figure 1 – Simple market structure between end user, retailer, generator and the market In this case, there is a Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) between the retailer and the generator based on a Contract-For-Difference (CFD) with the wholesale market price. A Corporate PPA is a similar arrangement directly between the end user and a generator but is typically a long-term Power Purchasing Agreement with a renewable electricity generator, although it doesn’t necessarily have to be renewable. These PPAs are often negotiated prior to the development of the renewable generation assets being built as they are very important prerequisites for the project financing by the banks. It is for this reason that end users are able to enter into a PPA for long-term electricity supply at a price well below the current wholesale market price. There are generally two types of Corporate PPAs. One is a physical PPA that is a “behind-the-meter” supply of physical electricity to the end user that is co-located on the same site. In this case, the renewable electricity proponent enters into a contract to supply some or all of its output to the end user at a pre-determined price. The electricity is not supplied via the market, or a retailer however, there may be an agreement with the retailer to export surplus electricity to the grid at a pre-determined or floating price. The second type of Corporate PPA and the one that we will focus on, is called a “Synthetic PPA”. This is where the end user enters into a long-term off-take agreement with a proposed, or sometimes existing, renewable generator for the supply of electricity at a negotiated price. It is essentially a long-term CFD as the physical electricity supply is supplied via the retailer who may, or may not be, the project proponent. The retailer typically supplies the electricity at the variable wholesale market price and there is a separate cash settlement between the end-user and the renewable energy generator based on the difference in the PPA price and the underlying wholesale market price. The advantage of a Corporate PPA to an end-user is that it can secure a long-term electricity supply for a known certain price for some or all of its requirements. The advantage to a proposed renewable electricity generator is it can secure a financing for the project and a certain long-term price for its output. The simplified relationship between the end-user, retailer, generator and the market differs from the traditional approach in that now the end-user has a direct relationship with the generator and the generator does not necessarily have a direct relationship with the retailer, although it can have a relationship or it can even be the same entity. Figure 2 – Simple PPA market structure between end user, retailer, generator and the market Avid readers of this four-part series would have noticed that, with the exception of the PPA, the structure is the same as an end-user with a pool price pass-through supply agreement with a retailer as discussed in Part 2 of this series . So a Corporate PPA is, in effect, a long term hedge against wholesale market pool price exposure. However, that hedge price has more recently been observed to be well below the current market prices. Figure 3 shows a chart that was introduced in in Part 2 of this series . The box plots compare actual average monthly wholesale market spot prices from July 2016 to June 2018 and observed retail price offers made throughout that same two-year period. Whilst not comparing “apples with apples” it does give an indication of the differences in wholesale prices and fixed price retail offers. On average, wholesale market prices were 26% below typical fixed price retail offers. Even lower prices could have been achieved with the market exposure approach through effective demand side management. Figure 3 – Box Plots of Average Monthly Pool Prices and Observed Typical Monthly Retail Offers Over 2-Year Period July 2016 – June 2018 Enter the Corporate PPA. There has been commentary that PPAs have been struck in South Australia at or below $80/MWh for a “firmed” product (we will come back to “firmed” products). In the Eastern States, PPAs have been reported to have been struck at even much lower prices closer to $50/MWh. Figure 3 shows where this firm PPA price level sits with respect to both the wholesale prices and the fixed retail prices over the last two-years. If you were an end-user who has been taking pool exposure in South Australia then a PPA offer of $80/MWh would look very attractive as a hedge, at current market prices. If you were an end-user who used a more traditional fixed price retail contract then a PPA offers the opportunity to reduce the energy component of electricity bills by more than 40%. Of course, the above scenario is highly simplified and negotiating a PPA is much more complex. The most obvious issue is that a renewable electricity generator such as wind or solar does not have a continuous flat output. Wind generation depends on the wind blowing and wind strength. Solar generation depends on the time of year and the extent of cloud cover. Both depend on design issues, quality of components and ongoing maintenance. The box plots cover two-years of price data but a PPA is most often for a period of more than seven-years. So it is important to have a good understanding of the market and market trends and form a view of likely future prices when negotiating a PPA. PPAs have a wide range of permutations of contract parameters that the end-user needs to be very wary of when negotiating an agreement. Some of the most obvious ones are: Does the agreement contract for a certain percentage or all of the actual sent-out generation? i.e. does the end-user takes the generation volume risk? Does the agreement contact for a fixed volume based on a modelled output from the generator? i.e. the generator takes on the generation volume risk and supplies a fixed volume. Does the agreement contract for a fixed flat volume and fixed price with the renewable generator providing a “firmed” product? i.e. the generator takes on the generation volume risk and hedges with other parties to provide it with fixed prices on additional volume required when the renewable generation isn’t occurring, known as “firming”. Does the end-user receive Large Scale Renewable Generation Certificates LGCs as part of the agreement? Does the end-user receive certificates on a 1:1 basis of volume contracted or based on the mandatory surrender rate for each year? Is the entire output from the renewable generation project dedicated to the one end-user or does it supply a portfolio of end users? How is actual generation allocated? Does the end-user have any control over the generation operation? What is the term of the agreement? Is there a buyer option to extend at the end of the term? Most PPAs are at least seven years in order to achieve financing from the banks. Is there an annual price escalation clause? What is the formula? If there is a change in law in regard to LGCs or a carbon trading scheme introduced which party bears the risk or receives the benefit. E.g. if a carbon trading scheme is introduced and the wholesale market price increases as a result, how is this taken into account in the CFD? Will the renewable generator also provide the retail service? If so, what are the retail service charges? In addition to the different contractual forms that a PPA can take, there are also several risks that the end-user needs to be aware of and manage. The most important are: Counterparty risks – the risk of the renewable electricity project not going ahead and conditions precedent not met or the risk of the project proponent financially failing and going into liquidation Volume risks – the risk that the project will not generate the expected volumes (depending on which party is wearing that risk) or the end-user having much higher or much lower consumption volume than planned. For example, an effective energy efficiency program could drive consumption below the contracted volume. Profile risk – the risk that the generation volume is different than modelled. For example, if there was a change in long-term wind patterns that was far different to the initial modelling. The end-user usage profile could be different than planned resulting in a mismatch between the planned generation and usage profiles. Price risk – although current PPAs are being priced well below current wholesale market prices, an increase in renewable generation penetration could drive long-term prices down below the PPA prices over the term of the agreement. This would mean that the end-users with PPAs struck, say in 2018, could be paying higher prices than the fixed retail contracts and wholesale market prices in 2022 and beyond. Legislative risks – change in law. This is particularly relevant in energy legislation in Australia. Changes in government can result in significant legislation changes that can impact the value of LGCs or the costs of renewable generation. Accounting risks – a CFD is a derivative and so the end user will need to apply more complex hedge accounting treatment. If the whole offtake from a project is contracted to one end-user, then it may be considered as a lease rather than a hedge and completely different accounting treatment applies. Long-term business strategy – the PPA term will most likely be more than seven years. The business needs to consider its potential operational profile in the context of its long-term strategy. For example, is the business considering rationalising operations, moving offshore, investing in expansion opportunities or embarking on an aggressive energy efficiency program. End-users need to determine whether they want all of their electricity supply to be firm and at a fixed price or whether they want to contract a proportion of their usage via a PPA and then the balance from the wholesale market. For example, a manufacturing facility with a 30 MW load may be able to curtail half of its load for large periods. They may contract for 15 MW with a PPA and leave the balance of their requirements exposed to the wholesale market price and then use a demand response strategy to reduce the cost of the uncontracted volume. Corporate PPAs are gaining momentum as a method for end-users to reduce their electricity costs compared with the more traditional fixed price retail supply agreements. At the moment, Corporate PPAs are being executed with very large electricity users, however it will become increasingly popular for smaller users to combine into energy buying groups to take advantage of the same significant costs savings. Corporate PPAs are quite complex and require a thorough understanding of the electricity market, the structure of the agreements and the significant risks. However, with risk comes significant reward.

    "title": "We’re preparing an extensive “Generator Report Card”, and would welcome discussion (with your pre-orders)",
    "date": "29-10-2018 08:54:00 AM",
    "content": "From time to time there are particular topics that we develop a deeper interest in, sufficient to prepare analysis that goes well beyond a single article on WattClarity – or even a series of articles. The growing chorus of mixed messages and concerns about generator performance is one such instance. It’s an area where we see Villain #4 active, meaning cost and risk for the NEM transition. As such, we are teaming up with several experts in different areas (including Greenview Strategic Consulting ) to prepare an extensive Generator Report Card with data to 31st December 2018, for release early in 2019. (A) Various concerns about generator performance In recent months we have been compiling a listing of concerns voiced by various parties about different aspects of generator performance (some technical, some commercial, some environmental and so on). The following are some examples: Topic of Public Discussions (some examples only, our list is much longer) Considerations about this topic Concerns that existing thermal generators are becoming less reliable On several instances in the past (such as this article on March 2015 ) we have flagged the concern that the changing mode of operation of thermal generation, and the changing economics of such, would lead to accelerated degradation of this fleet of assets. More recently, there has been a growing chorus of people highlighting instances where coal-fired generators have tripped (and tagged them on Twitter as #coalfail ). Strictly speaking, power station trips are a normal part of operating any type of industrial process, as noted previously here – however we understand the essence of the concern. This concern was discussed in our article on March 2015. It seems to us that what’s more important are questions such as: whether the failure rate is increasing – and, if so, how rapidly; whether this change (if any) is specific to certain generators, or a pattern shared across all; what this might mean in terms of acceleration of degradation , and hence possible earlier closure; and possible implications for wider system reliability . Claims that intermittent supplies are becoming increasingly constrained – or, in particular, constrained down. Many WattClarity readers will know of the System Strength constraint that is reducing output of semi-scheduled wind and solar plant in South Australia. There are also concerns about constraints on semi-scheduled output in other areas of the NEM, such as: with a number of the projects given the tick of approval in t he Victorian renewable energy auction scheme ; and with the rapid build-out of new generation projects in northern Queensland (more on that one later). More recently we have seen some claims, and counter-claims, about the extent to which groups of wind/solar farms are being constrained down. This might be measured a number of ways (e.g. % of time, or % of volume for starters), and we are interested to have an objective look. Awareness (sometimes perhaps belatedly) that Marginal Loss Factors can, and do, vary significantly over time. We posted this article in July 2018 about how Marginal Loss Factors change over time – which is (apparently) something that has only been realized belatedly by a number of new entrant generation developers. Given how centrally Marginal Loss Factors feature in the bidding, dispatch, and revenue processes (and also in the quantities of LGCs that are formally registered for renewable projects), it’s critically important that all generators understand these numbers. We’ll provide you some easy-to-access history. Various concerns about the revenues being earned , and input costs being paid , by different types of generators. Commercial returns drive many decisions being made in the NEM – both shorter term tactical decisions, and also longer term strategic decisions. One central part of the Return Equation is the top line revenue being earned from production. Based on data that is publicly available, it is possible to approximately calculate spot revenues (though not contracted revenues). We are interested to see what trended revenue can tell us about the decisions being made: trended gross spot revenue; and trended average revenue per MWh production. The other central part of the Return Equation are the costs incurred in production. These are confidential to the individual participant (hence not directly considered in the price-based dispatch process, as noted here ). However we are exploring what might be possible to infer, from generator bidding behaviour, about their cost structures. Of particular interest is how these costs are changing over time . Various perspectives, including some misconceptions, about bidding behaviour It seems like generator bidding behaviour is never far from the general discourse about the operation of the National Electricity Market. The AEMC’s assessment of rebidding in the national electricity market released on 11th October 2018 was one trigger – which itself followed on from others. Separately, we had also identified some particularly intriguing instances of rebidding and dispatch management at semi-scheduled plant that had raised more questions for us. On the other hand, we have also seen a number of new entrants taking a very passive role in the extent to which they (don’t) bid in the market – and we wonder what this might be costing them. We’re interested to assess bidding and rebidding practices comprehensively in order to provide a contextual framework to assist this conversation moving forward by both: Having a look at every power station individually; and Trending this data over time to see changes in patterns. Questions relating to which generators have been involved in setting the price , and with what frequency Coupled with questions about bidding behaviour (and perceptions of input costs) have been questions related to how often certain generators have been involved in setting the price. Despite (or perhaps especially because of) the multi-dimensional nature* of the price setting process, we are particularly curious to investigate this one further. In our experience, the price setting data published by AEMO (and hence made available in ez2view ) for each dispatch interval is multi-dimensional: (a) In almost every dispatch interval, it is more than one unit (DUID) that is involved in setting the price; (b) Oftentimes, it can be units outside of the region in question that are involved in setting the price; (c) Contributions to the price setting process can actually be negative , on occasions (i.e. even when the dispatch price in that period is positive); and (d) Reasonably frequently, we see bids for an FCAS commodity involved in setting the price for Energy. This also happens the other way around (i.e. bids for Energy affect the FCAS price). Hence, we are lending some thought to what a correct answer might be in that respect. We have a longer list than this – and we’d certainly be interested to hear from you if there are others you think we should be specifically aware of: please drop us a line using this feedback form , remembering to provide us a phone number we can reach you on if we have questions about your suggestions. or just give us a call on 07 3368 4064 (B) We’ve begun analysis across all power stations in the NEM Given our position with respect to the Australian NEM, we are somewhat uniquely placed* to take a look at what the data is actually telling us in relation to the questions listed above, and the longer list of other questions we’ve not shared publicly here. * what we mean by saying that “we are … uniquely placed” is that: (a) we have collected and collated an extensive history to the NEM (in a large MMS database, including all the old predispatch runs + in a range of other data, such as being collated for our Generator Catalog ); (b) we are not a participant in the market, and are independent of any client or participant; (c) we have a very broad/diverse client base, which provides us what might be a unique perspective in understanding the breadth of the questions being asked in different quarters about how the generation sector has been performing; (d) we strive to remain technology agnostic ( as noted before ) – and instead are intensely interested in what insights real data can reveal about each and every power station, no matter what technology type. (e) we are increasingly partnering with others who can complement our capability (such as for this Generator Report Card). Hence, we have begun analysis that will lead into the compilation of an extensive Generator Report Card that will cover all power stations across the NEM, no matter what their fuel type or technology. (C) We welcome your input, with your pre-order We understand that the normal approach would be to wait until we’d completed the analysis and completed the report before offering our readers the opportunity to purchase a copy. The normal approach for clients would be to wait until the report was finished, in order to actually be able to see what you’re buying. However there are a occasions when we don’t do “normal”. We also recognize that there will be some of our readers who trust us enough that we will deliver some high quality insights in this process, and are keen to have an input into the specific questions and concerns we invest our energies into exploring over the next couple of months. We would very much welcome that input from those committed to the outcome – hence would welcome pre-orders at a low rate of only $900 exGST : Order here to pay by credit card when the report is delivered to you . We won’t process your payment until we deliver this report. However sending in your pre-order now will provide you some additional benefits: Engagement in our analysis First and foremost, we would welcome your views on what you would like to see as priority focus in this report. We can’t promise that we will cover everything you suggest to us, nor that we will follow your suggested priority order – but we can guarantee that: we will very interested to hear your contribution, and that we will factor your thoughts into our process as best as we are able. If you are not able to provide us a pre-order at this time but still have an interest in offering your suggestions of course you could do this here . However our priority will remain with those who have demonstrated a confidence in us to deliver by providing their pre-order of this Report Card. Earliest delivery For those who pre-order the report, we will have a focused interest on delivering to you as soon as the report has been finalised (target early 2019). Only after we have done this will we broaden our focus to also encompass those who might have decided to wait until the completion of the report. Cost saving We’re not giving much thought, currently, to what the final price will be for the report. That’s something that we will do into 2019. What we can say is that the price you pay to pre-order now ($900 ex GST) will certainly be the lowest you could pay for the report. We’d welcome your pre-orders for the report now (this price will remain valid up until 31st December 2018 – but the purchase price of the report will change* into 2019 ). * We don’t know, at this point, what the price in 2019 will be (and also the final price once released). We are clear, however, that the value the report will deliver (when we have investigated concerns such as those listed above) will be considerably more than the $900 early-bird pre-order rate. The pre-order form can be downloaded from here – until 31st December 2018. (D) What we currently know about the Generator Report Card 2018 With the analysis underway currently, we do not know precisely how the Report Card will look. These details will become clearer over the next couple months, as our analysis project continues. What we do know are the following: Electronic PDF We see the report being in electronic form – most likely in a PDF. Because of the likely size of the report, it will be much too large to email to you, so we will set up a downloads site from which you can access the report when it is ready. Scope of use The report will be yours to share across your organisation – no matter how large. Various sections We’re envisaging that the report will contain: Discrete results for every generator (about 300 of them) in the NEM – coverage in this detail will mean that the report does go into a high degree of specificity Aggregations (e.g. by Region, by Fuel Type, and by Portfolio) – aimed at helping you see the wood for the trees Insights gleaned with respect to the higher level questions above. Because of this breadth of coverage, we envisage that the report will extend to hundreds of pages , which will make it necessary to include a separate Executive Summary with higher level insights included. We envisage that this report will be useful to you for about 12-18 months after it has been delivered. At that point we might (depending on our other commitments, and customer demand) look to update it again. (E) To keep track of the status We envisage that we will sporadically update this particular page here to reflect the provide updates, as the report comes together. Hence, check back here for updates as the report comes together…. .",

    "date": "21-10-2018 04:55:00 PM",
    "content": "An alert reader alerted us to the possibility of the demand in South Australia dropping to an all-time minimum level through the afternoon of Sunday 21st October 2018. Here’s a snapshot of NEM-Watch v10 that I’ve taken to highlight how low the demand currently is (Scheduled Demand at 665MW in the 10:10 dispatch interval) and how it is forecast to drop quite low (current forecast for 470MW in the 13:00 trading period): Now with this forecast of record all-time minimum, we should note three things: Note #1) In this case we are going to use “Scheduled Demand” on a dispatch target basis as the gauge of electricity demand in the South Australian region – with many of the nuances/permutations of measuring/calculating “electricity demand” explained in this earlier WattClarity post . Note #2) Using this measure, electricity supplies from various embedded generation sources (most notably rooftop PV) subtract off the actual rate of electricity consumption to drive Scheduled Demand lower. Note #3) Calling this an “all-time* record minimum” means that we’re excluding the effect of the SA blackout of September 2016 , where Scheduled Demand fell to almost 0MW. As it turned out, the lowest the Scheduled Demand reached today (at least later in the afternoon, when this short article was posted) was down at 536MW at 12:55 early this afternoon. We see that (at the time of the 16:10 NEMwatch snapshot) injections of small-scale solar PV were declining through the afternoon, which would be one of the contributions to the climbing Scheduled Demand: Logging into NEMreview v7 online , I quickly ran a query for monthly minimum demand to confirm the suspicion that today we’d seen something down at the bottom of the historical range (apart from the blackout): Finally, curiosity getting the better of me before posting this article, I had a quick look at successive AEMO forecasts for Scheduled Demand through the afternoon through the “Forecast Convergence” widget in ez2view . The snapshot below highlights how (on a trading period basis) the earlier forecast down at 470MW for the 13:00 trading period ended up being 562MW (or 92MW higher – which is not much in absolute terms, but is a 20% increase on the forecast seen in the forecast shown in the 10:10 NEMwatch snapshot above): We’re looking forward to working with the relevant people within AEMO to make this particular functionality better than it already is, for the benefit of all of our ez2view clients.",

    "date": "18-10-2018 12:06:00 PM",
    "content": "It is curious that despite of the findings of the recent ACCC enquiries and the on-going regulatory uncertainty (at both a state and federal level), anyone would be willing to set-up an electricity retailer. New venturers in the energy market could be forgiven for thinking that running a successful energy retail business is as simple as having the right processes, systems and marketing tools; that a retailer is only a “ billing agent ”. In this context, energy retailers – as with any intermediary business – need treasury to fund the time lag between when they purchase goods on the wholesale market (energy from the NEM at spot price) and when they get paid by their customers. The introduction of smart meters, particularly in Victoria, has allowed a shortening of this timeframe and with it, a reduction in the requirement for treasury funding. New energy retailers tend to focus on the marketing aspect of the business, and can end up ignoring or overlooking the procurement component and the significant funding it requires. Let me explain: from the end-user/customer perspective, the retailer may well be a billing agent; but from the wholesale market perspective it is a “ credit agent ”. One key role of the retailer is to collect (and chase) the money from customers, and redistribute it to faceless market participants: network, AEMO, hedge providers… The below graph schematises the “electron” flow (from generators through networks to end-users – in black) and the “money” flow (from end-users, through retailers to “wholesale” operators – in red). While the retailer is remote from the physical aspect (electron) it is the sole customer facing body when it comes to money collection. The networks, AEMO, the generators and the hedge providers all depend on the retailer to get paid for the energy they produce, transport or hedge. This role is defined under the NER (National Electricity Rules) as the Financially Responsible Market Participant (FRMP), with following responsibilities: Timely and accurately invoicing of customers Collection of money from end-users Payment to networks for access and usage Payment to market for energy usage (AEMO), who in turn will pay the generators Settlement of energy hedges (positive or negative cash flow) As per these responsibilities, the retailer must provide credit support or a financial guarantee to protect its creditors in event of default. As such, the energy procurement/hedging function is working capital hungry. AEMO must ensure the NEM is whole from a settlement perspective and there is no payment shortfall. Each debtor (mostly retailers) must post and maintain prudential, reflective of their level of exposure and potential outstanding. It is important to note that generators are rarely required to lodge prudential, being creditors to the NEM. Network operators may at times require credit support from retailers (depending on credit profile). Likewise, hedge counterparts may rely on the ISDA’s Credit Support Annex, to obtain credit support from lesser creditworthy counterparts. The ASX, like the NEM, must always be whole from a settlement. So, like AEMO, the ASX (or the clearers) require initial margins for each trade/hedge executed on the exchange (buy or sell). Further, those trading counterparts may call for additional credit support during volatile price periods to offset an increase of outstanding, adverse change in mark-to-market positions or a degradation of the credit risk profile. AEMO and the ASX monitor outstanding/Market-to-Market position of participants daily. Volatile market conditions, price spikes (MPC) may trigger a “margin call” (most likely in the form of cash) which must be responded to overnight, even though it may ultimately have a negligible impact at settlement. The most common forms of credit support are bank guarantees or cash. The retailer must ensure it has access to liquid and immediately accessible working capital to respond to such calls. Failure to do so will trigger market operators (ASX and/or AEMO) to close position and deregister the failing party, often triggering cascading events toward administration. The NEM’s history is littered with examples of retailers carrying a positive balance sheet but defaulting because they were unable meet their credit support requirements. Late in 2009, NSW based retailer Jack Green failed to pay a $0.5m bill to NSW network operator Integral. It immediately triggered a suspension by AEMO, followed by a revocation of its retail licence, culminating in the company going into administration. According to the receivers, Jack Green owed $11m to major creditors (hedge providers, network and AEMO) while the accounts showed up to $25m of unpaid bills by customers [1] . More recently, Go Energy suffered the same fate, unable to fund increasing AEMO prudential resulting from the seasonal growth of its customer demand (+40%) combined with high spot prices during January 2016. Credit support, collateral or prudential are not new concepts. In the financial sector, the APRA regime compels banks to hold sufficient reserves to reflect their liabilities. Recently the banks invoked those increasing requirements to justify the raising of interest rates – a luxury that energy retailers are not afforded despite an increasing need for working capital driven by higher prices, higher volatility, higher funding costs (ref. interest rate above), higher compliance costs and a more favourable customer protection regime. Despite the name, “working” capital is not productive. Cash or bank guarantees attract hefty drawing costs and generate little interest. It is difficult to explain to any willing investor that part of their money will be “sleeping” on the account of the counterpart – not contributing to incremental revenue. Unfortunately, retailers have a limited number of options to mitigate these working capital requirements and associated costs. The AEMO settlement process includes a “reallocation” mechanism which allows one participant to allocate a “trading amount” to another. The participant will be credited with that trading amount, reducing its outstandings and prudential liability toward AEMO. Conversely, the participant offering the re-allocation is liable for that trading amount and is taking a credit risk against the benefiting party. Reallocations can be treated as “short term lending”; providers will usually charge a fee for service and require some form of collateral or credit support to protect their position. Retailers can hardly pass those imposts to their customers, despite being “Financially Responsible” on their behalf. Customer credit assessment is limited and they benefit from a protective regime in terms of delayed/default payment, which renders the recovery process lengthy and costly, and ultimately in excess of the value of the debt. In cases where the retailer is forced to write off a customer’s non-recoverable debt, it has no recourse or access to credit support to mitigate its net loss, unlike market participants further up the supply chain. For example, hedge contracts typically attract credit support of around 10% of face value. Applying this figure to the annual average electricity bill, can energy retailers ask their customers a bond of $150 when they join? I thought not … [1] https://www.smh.com.au/business/jackgreen-funds-unlikely-to-reach-power-companies-20100103-lnan.html About our Guest Author Tiburce Blanchy is the director of Adour – Energy advisory.

    "date": "09-10-2018 12:18:00 PM",
    "content": "It’s October 2018 already, meaning 15 months have passed since I spoke at Clean Energy Summit 2017 and provided a forecast of sorts (for train wreck underway) . Since that time I have only been able to post more about 4 of the Villains that we see at work in helping our complex energy transition run off the rails: Villain #1 First and foremost, I see the long-running failure of our “ emperors with no clothes ” as a huge (and perhaps the biggest) driver of our energy transition train wreck … Villain #2 … however our political class have been aided and abetted by us, the voting public , in that we have been seemingly unable to deliver stable support for the complexities inherent in such a large transformation … Villain #3 Both politicians and public alike have been pulled from both extremes by an increasingly loud shouting match that’s emerged across both extremes of the Emotion-o-meter . Villain #4 With participants at all points on that scale (including us as a company, and yours truly) suffering from the yawning gap that’s emerging between required and current “Energy Literacy” . This week I note that the AFR National Energy Summit is running in Sydney, which follows on from All Energy last week in Melbourne – in what seems to be a conveyor belt of industry get-togethers. I was at All Energy so can’t make the AFR Summit, but I do wonder whether there is a realistic chance that the participants will avoid falling into the trap (which seems to be affecting us increasingly) of not focusing on the “real” problems : Too often, over recent years, I have been reminded of the “Streetlight Effect” when observing the muddle being made of various aspects of the energy transition process: The “Streetlight Effect” is a parable about a person found searching under a streetlight for their car keys, when in reality they lost them somewhere else. In some renditions, the person is drunk – hence the alternate title of “the drunkard’s search”. For those who have not heard this before it’s discussed here , here and here (and no doubt many other places). I’ll start this post off today by noting a couple examples of how we’ve been seen to exhibit this sort of behaviour with respect to the energy sector transition. As time permits, I’ll post separately about other examples, and link them into the table below… Date added Example of Villain #5 Brief discussion Initial (Tue 9th Oct 2018) Not accounting directly for a price on carbon It’s been noted many times by many different people, so not going to expand on this in this post – the most efficient/effective way to mitigate emissions would be to have a broad-based price on carbon emissions. Unfortunately, as a result of prior Villains, we’re left with sub-optimal policy outcome – of which the last one currently standing is the various forms of target on renewable energy penetration: (a) nationally through the MRET, and (b) through individual state-based schemes. Though these programs do have other benefits (not the least of which, for our Villains no1 , being that they are popular with fickle villains no2 – hence some would say pragmatic ), we should not lose sight of the fact that they are likely to be delivering a more expensive outcome than might have otherwise been the case. Let’s call this instance Villain 5a . Initial (Tue 9th Oct 2018) Focus on changing rules, rather than addressing underlying structural issues I’ll flag this one today and hopefully find time to return later to expand on this one. There are a number examples we have seen over a number of years whereby various parties have seemed to avoid “the elephant in the room” whilst seeking to change market rules (or mandate behaviour) to address natural outcomes of given structural configurations. As an example of this, we have the QLD Government’s “don’t make too much money” direction to Stanwell Corporation back in June 2017 – when (as noted here a couple weeks later ) it was the Government’s 3-into-2 merger that created the pre-conditions that led to the escalation in volatility in the first place. Let’s call this instance Villain 5b . Added on 12th December Increasingly there is too much focus on COST, whilst not enough focus on VALUE Added this post here on Wednesday 12th December following the latest round of celebrations on social media about the ongoing decline in the cost of production from renewable (i.e. wind and solar PV) sources. The obsessive focus on COST has reached (passed?) it’s use-by date. Our collective focus should have been shifted already to one of VALUE. This one is Villain 5c . Tue 5th March 2019 Obsessing about NegaWatts, and losing sight of Demand Response Added this post here on Tuesday 5th March 2019 in conjunction with some more general thoughts here about the latest round of deliberations at the AEMC about ways to facilitate a more active and responsive demand side in the NEM. It seems, to me, that some have lost sight of the real objective whilst focusing obsessively on NegaWatts in particular. This one is Villain 5d . Soon Another example of not focusing on the real problem The next post about Villain 5e is coming shortly (time permitting). Later More to come… We’ll add more examples later… I’m sure that some of our readers will have encountered other examples of how Villain no5 has manifest itself in the energy sector through this transition process. Feel free to add your examples as comments below, or provide us your feedback directly/confidentially – or just give us a call !",

    "title": "How To Reduce Electricity Costs – Part 2",
    "date": "08-10-2018 02:22:00 PM",
    "content": "In the previous article on reducing electricity costs we looked at energy efficiency and the fact that the cheapest electricity is the electricity that you don’t consume. In this article we will look at how to pay less for the electrons that you do consume. The article is based on Chapter 13 (Step 6) of my book “ Power Profits – A Comprehensive 9-Step Framework for Reducing Electricity Costs and Boosting Profits ” . Retailers bundle up electricity products into a vanilla product that have risk premiums and profit margins built into them, and many businesses are unaware that there are alternatives to buying electricity at these risk-premium-laden fixed prices. The standard retail contract Most businesses in Australia purchase electricity as a bundled retail product from a licensed retailer. The retailer takes care of the administration of the customer’s supply service, so that the customer need only turn on the switch and electrons start flowing, and a bill turns up each month. The retailer is doing a lot of work in the background that the customer never sees, such as: Contracting for electricity to supply to the customer purchasing the environmental certificates required to meet the customer’s obligations organising a meter agent to monitor, record and report consumption data from the meter paying the network provider for transmission and distribution charges calculating the bill and sending bills to customers and ensuring that they pay. All of this work takes human effort as well as automated processes, and therefore there are associated costs. Retailers are not in the business of providing free services; their owners – government, local shareholders or overseas companies – require the retailer to make a profit, so they charge a profit margin on the provision of the electricity supply service. All of this is fair and reasonable, as it would cost most businesses more to do this work themselves, unless they are extremely large electricity consumers. The hidden cost However, retailers provide another service that most businesses don’t even realise they are getting, and it’s an expensive service. Retailers provide a risk management service (insurance service) bundled in with the supply of the electricity, often at high risk premiums. There are quite a few risks that the retailer takes away from the customer, including: volume risk: the risk of exposure to the wholesale market if the customer does not consume the exact amount of electricity assumed in the supply agreement load profile risk: the risk of exposure to the wholesale market if the customer does not use electricity throughout the day, week, month and year as was assumed in the supply agreement market risk: the risk of exposure to fluctuations in prices in the electricity market credit default risk: the risk to the retailer if the customer cannot pay their bills. To some extent the retailer smooths out the risks by aggregating all of the different customers into one or more portfolios, thus reducing the large number of individual risks into one or more portfolio risks. The profit risk to the retailer can then be stress tested against different scenarios, such as large movements in average market prices and changes in the overall economy that affect demand and credit defaults. The impact of the assumptions made in an individual supply contract can also be tested against the overall portfolio. So, the poor old retailer is bearing the brunt of everybody else’s risks. As the retailer is having to wear those risks, it charges a premium to do so, and that premium reflects worst-case scenarios. Instead of the retailer being burdened by the weight of their customers’ risks, it is now feeling the weight of potential sacks of gold over its shoulders. If the worst-case scenarios do not manifest, then they get to pocket the worst-case scenario premiums that they have charged their customers. The customers who enter into a straightforward vanilla electricity supply agreement pay the following price for the energy component of their bill: Retail energy price = Wholesale energy price + Administration costs + Risk premium (volume, load profile and credit risks) + Retailer margin There are other options Many businesses don’t even realise that there are other options for purchasing electricity. Negotiating a good price on a standard retail contract might seem like a good approach, but if you understand the intricacies of the electricity market and the electricity requirements of your business, you can achieve huge financial benefits if you get a bit more creative with your electricity purchasing. Managing your own risk The risk premium that the retailer builds in assumes that the customer has no ability to manage its own risk. However, there are ways that the customer can manage its own risk through demand side management (DSM) to avoid high prices and achieve very low average prices compared to what is offered by the fixed retail offers. Load curtailment The first DSM method is load curtailment. By monitoring market half-hour prices, businesses can reduce their load when price spikes occur and avoid the very high prices that sometimes drag the average monthly price above the median price. Load shifting The second DSM method is load shifting. By understanding likely price patterns, such as early morning and late afternoon price increases, businesses can often shift their load – to some extent – to maximise the exposure to the very low prices and minimise their exposure to the higher prices. In recent years, middle-of-the-day prices are very low due to solar generation. Great examples of end users who can apply this are irrigators and water utilities that can schedule pumping at times when prices are historically low, while not running when prices are historically higher. Couple that method with load curtailment to avoid the price spikes and these businesses can achieve average prices well below the fixed retail price offers. Adopting a pool price pass-through strategy So, your business carries out an analysis of the electricity spot market, your own load profile and operating constraints, and weighs up the opportunities and risks of adopting a pool price pass- through strategy. But where to from here? There are two ways you can adopt a pool price pass-through strategy: The first is to contract with a retailer to supply you on the basis of pool pass-through prices. With this type of supply arrangement, the retailer will charge a management fee to cover their own costs and to make a margin. The cost of the management fee will be an important consideration. The second way is to become an electricity market participant as an end-user participant. This method is usually only viable for very large users and requires significant management oversight. Let’s consider each of these options. Wholesale prices through a retailer There is an alternative to paying what can be very large risk premiums which most businesses don’t even know about. Businesses can buy electricity at wholesale prices through a retailer and keep the risk premium in their own pockets. This leads to a new price calculation for the business, with the difference shown here: Strategy Formula Plain Vanilla i.e. the traditional retail procurement approach, described above Price you pay, as an energy user = Wholesale energy price + Administration costs + Risk premium (volume, load profile and credit risks) + Retailer margin Buying on spot one option for doing this is to arrange for wholesale prices through a retailer Price you pay, as an energy user = Market pool price + Administration costs + Retailer margin The key difference (from the “Plain Vanilla” traditional arrangement) are: that the market pool price is not fixed – it fluctuates every half hour, and the average cost will vary from month to month; and the customer is not paying the risk premium. Many of the large retailers are not interested in providing a pool price pass-through product to customers. Aside from the fact that they may make less margin as the risk premiums that they usually receive are no longer part of a bundled supply agreement, their billing systems are often not set up for it. It may require someone to manage a single customer with their own spreadsheet outside the normal billing system. They also may consider that the credit risk, or risk of default, is higher. They therefore usually only, begrudgingly, offer this type of facility to very large customers, and usually with a large management fee. Small and medium-size retailers are often more flexible and willing to offer a pool price pass-through arrangement. The management fee varies considerably between retailers, and it is important to find one that provides the best service and/or price. You can go out to tender or make a request for proposals from retailers for a pool price pass-through supply offer, and then simply compare the product offerings. This will be largely, though not solely, based on price. Some retailers are becoming innovative in this space and are offering a product that allows the customer to switch between pool price pass-through and fixed retail each month, or to take a combination of both. Some retailers provide price alerts and other information services that add value to their offer. Going directly to the market A large user may opt not to pay the retailer any management fee and become a market participant themselves. This is something we did in one of the businesses that I worked for. We had already established ourselves as market participants in the gas short-term trading market, and the leap to doing something very similar for electricity was not very large. However, inevitably there is still a substantial cost in managing the obligations that a market participant has, whether you outsource this function or employ someone and bring it in house. If the cost of becoming a market participant is not too different to the retailer management fee then I would suggest going with the retailer product instead. In this case of doing it yourself, the electricity cost equation becomes: Wholesale price = Market pool price + Administration costs (internal and/or 3 rd party) Wholesale Market Pool Price Pass through Strategy In Action Our historical data analysis has shown that if you adopt a pool price pass-through strategy your average price for the full year is likely to be at or below the best fixed retail price. In South Australia it is likely to be significantly below and depending on your load profile it may well be lower in Queensland. In Victoria and NSW the average price is likely to be near the fixed retail price. However, you can achieve even lower prices by actively managing your electricity usage and avoiding the higher price periods and the price spikes. It is the short-term duration price spikes that drive the average price up. The high price spikes can be largely avoided by adopting a load curtailment schedule. Developing a load curtailment schedule So how do you develop a load curtailment schedule that optimises your electricity cost without impacting your customer service and supply of products? The Theory of Constraints This is where we turn to the Theory of Constraints. The Theory of Constraints posits that with any manageable system – for example, a plant – there is one constraint, sometimes more, but rarely many. This means that there are usually many processes that are not constrained and can be turned off, or curtailed, without impacting the efficiency of the total supply chain. We need to identify the critical asset or assets that are constrained and then determine the opportunity cost of shutting down the asset, if at all possible. The opportunity cost establishes a break-even point where if that asset were to not operate for a short period of time then the opportunity cost equals the financial benefit of operating. There are of course other considerations. The customer should see no impact from curtailing load and should be oblivious to the fact that you do curtail as part of your operations management. Also, some types of equipment – particularly equipment that runs at high temperatures – are not designed to be shut down and restarted for short periods of time. This equipment may experience thermal shock, which will have a deleterious impact on equipment integrity or shorten its service life. For example, equipment that operates at elevated temperatures is usually refractory lined, and thermally cycling this equipment will have an impact on refractory life. The other non-constrained assets are those that are not required to run all of the time. This equipment is often shut down because the buffer stock after its process fills up or its scheduled operating time is less than the constrained asset run time. It is this equipment that we largely target to curtail in the event of high price spikes. I’ve had clients who initially say there’s no way they could contemplate shutting down equipment even for half an hour as it would impact upon costumer supply or service. However, when I have analysed those same plants I have found that they consistently shut down every day for morning and afternoon tea, lunch, meetings, breakdowns, and for full stock. They were often surprised at how often they actually shut down. Other clients have asked what they should do with their labour when they do shut down. There is always opportunity for clean ups, communication meetings, training, equipment risk assessments, and the list goes on. On the other end of the spectrum, I’ve had clients that have said they would shut everything down when price events occur at a particularly high level; for example, $1,000/MWh. This strategy may be effective if capacity exceeds demand, but it does not allow the fine tuning of cost reduction by curtailing equipment that’s not required when prices rise above a lower threshold; for example, $100/MWh. Risk Management But, isn’t it risky not to use standard retail contracts? Going a different way does have risk, but risk does not mean “risky”. Risk is simply uncertainty. With a pool price strategy, the average annual price is not certain and so there is a risk. A retail price is fixed and so there is no price risk. However, there is a very high risk that the fixed retail price will be higher than the average wholesale market price over a full year. Tom Adams, a former executive director of Energy Probe, an industry watchdog in Canada, has a great analogy about paying for fixed retail contracts: “Over a lifetime of driving, you know you’ll replace a couple of windshields. But if you insure your windshield, you don’t pay for two windshields – you pay for 10.” So yes, a spot exposure strategy is “riskier” than a vanilla fixed retail contract, and with taking on that “risk” there is an expectation of a return. History has shown that the worst possible outcome from a pool price exposure strategy has been close to the best retail offer prices, depending on the timing of the retail offer. The chart below shows box plots for the average monthly prices for the South Australian wholesale market from July 2016 to June 2018 (2-years) and for typical 12-month retail price offers made each month over that same period. For an explanation of box plots see here . It’s not quite comparing “apples with apples” as one box reflects actual monthly spot prices whereas the other box indicates fixed price offers for the next 12-months. However, the chart shows the difference in the volatility and average between wholesale and retail markets over a corresponding period. Each box pot contains 24 data points relating to monthly data over 2-years. The standard deviation (volatility) of wholesale pool pricing was 39.9 and it was 22.2 for the fixed retail pricing. So, the average wholesale monthly average pool price was almost twice as volatile (risky) than the wholesale market monthly average price. However, when we examine the average prices for the wholesale market over the 2-year period and the average 12-month retail price offers we can see that the fixed price average offer was $140.32/MWh and the average wholesale pool price was $103.57/MWh. That is a difference of $36.75/MWh (3.7 c/kWh). In my 17-years of experience of being 100% exposed to the wholesale market pool price in South Australia, I have found that the annual wholesale market pool price was at least the same as the best fixed retail price offer and most often significantly lower. The box plots in the chart show that you may have got your timing right and achieved a fixed price offer at the bottom of the fixed retail box “whisker”, however, that price was only as good as the average wholesale price over the 2-year period. The trick for businesses is to understand historical price volatility and annual average prices, overlay your informed view of what is happening in the market structure on the coming years, and then compare that with fixed price offers. If your informed view of likely market price distribution outcomes is at or above a fixed price offer, then by all means lock in the fixed price offer. If your informed view is that market prices are likely to average below the best fixed price offer, then why would you want to lock in high prices? I think it is risky for businesses to lock in high fixed price contracts without having regard for the likely outcome of variable market price outcomes. The clever businesses realise this and embrace the so-called “risk”. Electricity price risk management strategies Clever businesses understand risk and so are able to develop and implement risk management strategies to either further reduce their costs or limit downside risk. Electricity price risk can be managed using many different strategies: a retail contract fixes the price and gives certainty, but includes a large risk premium a wholesale pool price exposure with load curtailment reduces exposure to high price spikes but the final price is not certain hedging with financial instruments can provide some protection, such as: exchange-traded (ET) futures, options and caps over-the-counter (OTC) swaps, options and caps. physical hedging using self-generated electricity during price peaks; for example, solar, diesel, gas fired hybrid retail contracts. In the book “ Power Profits – A Comprehensive 9-Step Framework for Reducing Electricity Costs and Boosting Profits ” we delve deeper into each of these risk management approaches. Another form of emerging hybrid contract is a corporate Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) with a renewables project that offers the customer a long-term, attractive fixed electricity price during the period of solar and/or wind electricity generation, and then the remainder of the electricity is supplied at the wholesale market pool price. This residual market exposure can be managed by the DSM methods that we have covered in this article. The term of these contracts is usually between five and ten years. Some end users balk at locking in a contract for such a long period, but in the past such long-term contracts were the norm. I have reached agreement on a 15-year electricity supply contract that was the most competitive offer for year one of the contract and quickly became a contract that had pricing well below the retail market pricing in subsequent years. Long-term contracts tend to favour the buyer, provided you are not outwitted by the annual price escalation clause and/or take-or-pay obligations. There are lower cost alternatives to simply accepting the best of the risk-premium laden fixed retail prices that you are offered, and the subsequent residual risks can be effectively managed through Demand Side Management, financial hedging and physical hedging.

    "content": "We all know that electricity prices have escalated dramatically over the last couple of years. But did you know that it is possible to offset these increases and even achieve cost reductions in the face of increasing retail prices? Electricity bills are composed of: Energy charges (the cost of the electrons that you consume) Network charges (the cost of the supply infrastructure required to deliver the electrons to you) Retail supply charges (the cost of the hard work that the retailer puts in to ensure that electrons are delivered to you and a margin to reward them) Metering charges (the cost of measuring and reporting the amount of electrons that you consume) Market charges (the cost of the service that the Australian Energy Market Operator AEMO provides to ensure the smooth operation of the market) Environmental charges (the cost of the mandatory purchase and surrender of both small scale and large-scale renewable energy certificates) Figure 1 below shows a typical breakdown of a monthly electricity bill for a modest size load (approaching 1 MW) in SA. This end user has a wholesale pool price passthrough arrangement and so the energy charges need to be examined together with the retail supply charges. Figure 1 – Breakdown of a Typical Electricity Bill By Component We can see that, in this case, energy charges are 58% of the total cost. If we add retail supply charges, this comes to 62%. Many businesses believe that the only real method they have to achieve cost reductions is to run a competitive electricity supply tender and then run a tough negotiation with the lowest price offer provider. However, all of the incumbent major retailers are basing their offers on the recent historical performance of the same wholesale market, the same forward market for contracts and their own forward modelling of prices. Their “competitiveness” is largely around nuances with their generation portfolio, their contracted position and their current customer portfolio. But, essentially, there is little difference between the major retailers. At best, one retailer may be able to put forward an offer that is 5% better than the other retailers. All that hard work in running a competitive tender may deliver a 5% better cost outcome on the 62% of the bill that is competitive. This means that a well-run process may deliver a 3.1% saving over what may have been the case without a well-run competitive process. This is still a good saving over the next best offer, but it may well still result in a cost increase. There are several much more powerful methods to achieve significant real cost reductions. Figure 2 – Breakdown of Typical Bill By Charge Type Figure 2 shows the three forms of electricity charge type: energy usage, demand kVA and fixed costs and how they impact the total bill in the previous example. Whilst in Figure 1, 58% of the bill was due to energy charges, Figure 2 shows that actual energy usage drives 90% of the bill. So, the best method of reducing monthly electricity bills is to reduce energy consumption. With this end user, a very modest 10% improvement in energy efficiency will reduce their electricity bills by 9%, or three times the level of the well-run tender process. This will be approximately the same level of saving for most end users. Energy efficiency is one of the largest levers available to reduce electricity costs. The cheapest electricity is the electricity that you do not use. In my book “ Power Profits – A Comprehensive 9-Step Framework for Reducing Electricity Costs and Boosting Profits ” I examine some of the common electricity consumption waste that occurs, and how you can identify that waste and reduce or eliminate it to reduce business costs. Below is a brief overview of the Energy Efficiency Step of the framework. More detail is covered in the book. Everyone can reduce their electricity consumption Every household and business can reduce its electricity consumption. Most choose not to spend much effort on it. Energy savings at home In the simplest example, think of your own home. There are many ways to reduce electricity consumption. Some require investment while others require minimal effort. Everyone knows that you can reduce household electricity consumption by not leaving equipment running that is not required, such as televisions, computers, stereos, air conditioning and heating. But most people don’t pay much attention to switching appliances off. We also know that we don’t need to chill the air down to 18˚C in summer or warm it to 25˚C in winter. But most people do. We also know that when we buy appliances we could choose them based on an energy rating and the amount of power that they draw. But many people don’t. We know that when we walk around the house at night with the lights off we can still see where we are going due to the many little standby lights that are on with all of our appliances, such as televisions and set-top boxes, computers, stereos and microwaves. We know that we can turn them off at the wall to save on electricity, but most people don’t. We could even get serious about reducing energy consumption by putting shades over windows to stop the heat radiating into the room in summer, stopping the draft under doors causing additional heating or cooling, not using clothes driers, not running the pool pump as long as we do, changing out fluorescent light bulbs with LED lights, or by replacing our inefficient washing machines, fridges, dishwashers and other appliances with more modern and more efficient items. We don’t do all of these things because individually they may not cost much money on a daily basis, it’s a bit of a hassle, it’s a bit difficult and inconvenient to switch appliances off at the wall, it’s not the most important issue on our minds, or because the initiatives cost a bit of money upfront. Energy savings in the business It’s like that in our businesses, except our employees aren’t paying the bill out of their pocket so the level of attention and care is even lower. So how can we drive electricity consumption savings in the workplace if our employees aren’t really even interested in doing it at home and saving their own money? The answer is by focusing on it and making it a point of emphasis within the business. The best way to focus on electricity efficiency in the workplace is to engage employees in a team with a clear objective around energy efficiency. The energy-efficiency audit The first stage of any energy-efficiency project is to conduct an audit of the current situation. Fortunately, there are many resources on the internet that provide a guide to conducting energy-efficiency audits, and there is also an Australian/New Zealand Standard for Energy Audits AS/NZS 3598:2014. You may also wish to engage an experienced energy-efficiency auditing consultant to carry out the audit for you. The advantage of this is that they already know the sorts of things they are looking for and can carry out the audit usually more quickly and more thoroughly than if you had to do it with little starting knowledge. Most auditors will quite heavily utilise resources at the site so that there is very good engagement with employees. So, what are the opportunities that an audit will identify? Process efficiency In a processing facility most of the energy is used in the process, so small improvements in process efficiency can result in large energy savings. A process runs most efficiently when it’s running continuously with minimal changes and breakdowns. Quite often, operations people understand this and already do have a focus on steady operations and energy consumption per unit of product. However, this measure, while important, is usually subordinated to other important metrics and not given the focus it requires if energy savings are a business objective. Aside from process stability, some of the other opportunities to improve process efficiency and reduce electricity costs are: insulation to reduce heat loss variable speed drives on fans to replace mechanical dampers variable speed drives on pumps, rather than recirculation or throttling valves correct sizing of process equipment proper maintenance of equipment (such as cleaning of heat exchangers, ensuring minimum pressure drops) proper operation of equipment (such as standardised operating parameters and visual metrics). Utilities While the main process uses the bulk of the electricity, what is commonly underestimated is the amount of energy used in site utilities such as compressed air, heating, cooling, lighting, and cooling towers. And it’s in the utilities area where most of the losses or inefficiencies occur. Compressed air systems One of the biggest culprits is compressed air. In some businesses, compressed air can contribute up to 70% of total costs yet the inefficiencies can often be quite large. The US Department of Energy estimates that up to 30% of compressed air production is lost as leakage, and up to 50% is wasted through a combination of leakage, inappropriate use and artificial demand. Compressed air needs to be viewed as a total system and not just the operation of the compressors. The electricity cost for running compressors is commonly greater than 70% of the total lifecycle costs of the compressor. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning The Australian Government estimates that heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) in non-residential buildings consume approximately 9% of all electricity generated in Australia, and account for 40% to 60% of electricity consumption in those buildings. Yet HVAC systems are generally not well managed and are often plagued with inefficiencies due to inadequate maintenance, poor design and poor control. Refrigeration and chilling systems Refrigeration and chilling systems may be significant power users in some businesses. How do you determine if your refrigeration systems are working efficiently? An energy balance can be estimated by determining the theoretical electricity requirement based on design specifications and the volume and products stored, and this can be compared with the actual electricity consumption. The difference is unaccounted for heat gain. This can be quite a detailed and technically challenging operation, but it is very important for a business that uses refrigeration as a major process. The heat gain can come from things such as: inadequate or broken insulation on pipework air leakage through seals and airlocks too frequent access into the area by employees or customers pumps continuing to run even when the target temperature has been achieved the set point temperature being too low solar gain. Regular maintenance of the system is required to ensure that all plant and equipment is running per design and nothing has been broken, fouled or bypassed. Lighting Lighting can account for up to 40% of electricity costs in commercial buildings and up to 7% of industrial energy use, and savings of 75% to 90% can be achieved through smart thinking and the use of energy-efficient lighting. The simplest initiative is to turn lights off when not required. Think about your own industrial site, office building or home. Do you see lights left on during the daytime or in rooms or areas that are not being used? Simply encouraging a culture of turning lights off when not required and automating lights to start up and shut down at night and in the morning can save an appreciable amount of electricity. Installing skylights can reduce the requirement for indoor lighting during the day. And in combination with window glazing, reflective film or shade, windows can be a good source of light in offices during the day. Similar to other energy-efficiency initiatives, maintenance is important to ensure electricity consumption is kept at a minimum. Over time, many lamps produce less light but draw the same power. Lamps, reflectors and diffusers accumulate dirt, and this reduces light output. Sometimes additional lighting is added as a response, rather than cleaning the fittings. A lighting survey as part of an energy-efficiency audit can identify areas where the lighting is above standard so that the number of lamps could be reduced. A good lighting survey can also provide advice on whether lighting retrofits and/or upgrades are financially viable. Upgrading lighting systems, while sounding simple, can be quite complex. There are many retrofit and upgrade options beyond just changing out all lighting for LED lighting. * * * The cheapest electricity is the electricity that you do not have to consume. Many efficiencies can be achieved with zero or little cost, while some require a larger capital investment. The efficiency targets that you set will be based on your business’s energy objective and the priorities from your energy audit. Australia has enjoyed decades of low cost energy and it has been one of our major international competitive advantages. That has now been turned on its head and energy prices have become, at best, “internationalised” and at worst uncompetitive with our major international competitors. Our long period of low costs have allowed us to invest and install energy inefficient equipment and our maintenance practices have not focussed on maintaining energy efficiency. There is a huge opportunity in Australia to achieve substantial energy cost savings through adopting energy efficient strategy, technology and practices.

    "title": "Lessons from the trenches – 10 tips for new entrant generation developers",
    "date": "25-09-2018 09:35:00 AM",
    "content": "Through our consulting business, Greenview Strategic Consulting , we have had the pleasure of working with a variety of new entrants and NEM-veteran organisations alike in the generation sector of the NEM over the past few years (along with other clients). While everyone has their own reasons for engaging our business, there are several common themes we are finding as we travel with them that has prompted this post on WattClarity. Although this article is directed at new entrant generators , with the amount of change occurring in the industry this is equally as important to all types of participants, from tyre-kicker developers to incumbents. As GVSC celebrates its 3-year anniversary, think of this as a prompter for you and your interests to understand and respond accordingly. Theme 1: Electricity is like no other commodity Our industry is growing in many ways and people from all sectors of the economy (from within Australia and beyond) are becoming engaged, which is fantastic. For those who haven’t worked in electricity before, it takes some time to recognise that electricity is like no-other commodity or complex system on the planet. In fact, it is often referred to as one of (if not) the most complex systems ever designed – because without it, lots of things in modern society begin to change very quickly. Things that often challenge new entrants are factors such as the immediacy of the market, the lack of storage/stockpiling options – hence the requirement that production must meet demand at all times, which thereby introduced a high degree of variability and volatility. Even folks used to electricity markets overseas note the volatility of the Australian NEM because it’s one on the few “Energy Only” markets. Theme 2: Physics of the power system beats financial models every day of the week Due to the complexity noted in Theme 1, it is necessary to simplify things to ensure outcomes are achieved and understood. While this is necessary (even the very complex dispatch model AEMO uses to determine 5-minute prices is a major simplification of what really happens on the power system), it is important to ensure our financial, regulatory and technical simplifications are all aligned with what is required from the business AND aligned with reality. A recent conversation around MLF’s , where a developer told me ‘… the degradation in MLF was not in our business-model; who do we need to talk to get the MLF changed by AEMO’ underscores the confusion at times. As a consultant, we are often told ‘AEMO is being difficult, can you help?’ . Most of the time, it is a matter of educating our client and working with our client and AEMO to achieve reasonable and rationale outcomes. And while it is important to have the financial models and spreadsheets representing potential outcomes going forward, they are but a simplification of the world and will need to be updated to reflect reality – guaranteed! Theme 3: FCAS Matters I wrote here about FCAS back in March 2017 , and I’m told it’s still a widely read article on WattClarity. FCAS Matters! Whilst energy valuation is the main game of the wholesale electricity market, worth an estimated $15bn in 2017, that energy valuation does not occur without a number of fundamental technical factors being in place, one of the most important being frequency control ancillary service (FCAS) . As the islanding events on 25 August highlighted, when a disturbance happens, lots of dollars can change hands very quickly if you, as a participant, are not aware of all the various elements affecting your revenue. There has been growing cost of FCAS over recent years in the NEM and many markets around the world, following the closure of thermal plants. However there’s also opportunity, with the new breed of FCAS providers (such as batteries and demand response). Together this means that FCAS is certainly no longer a ‘nuisance market’, and is something that is ignored at an owners peril! Theme 4: The NEM is complex! Participating in the NEM (whether as a generator, retailer, or market customer) requires a sophisticated approach to manage what can be a very complex beast. Managing energy and frequency control ancillary services (FCAS), fuel costs, the range of thermal and intermittent renewable generation sources (including distributed generation), inter-connection between regions, constraint equations, and highly variable regional demand profiles highlights the complexity of issues and interacting variables that market participants must navigate to optimise their revenue (or manage cost outcomes). The introduction of new technologies (including battery storage), the continued growth in renewable generating capacity, developments in demand response, and continued uncertainty in energy and climate policy point to a future of increased complexity and changing market landscape. Theme 5: The operations of your plant are complex! Despite the urban myths and stories we sometimes hear in the industry, ‘sticking a few poles in the ground, slapping on a few panels and wires then watching the dollars come flooding in’ is nonsense! Voltage, Active Power, Frequency and harmonics are important concepts that must all be operating in union with the rest of the power system at 10-20 millisecond levels. Generator Performance Standards are a necessary requirement in the power system that cannot be simply left to the end of a connection process as ‘just detail’. Similarly, leaving this part of the process to the developer (who may or may not be around when the plant is operating), is a recipe for significant operating issues going forward. Theme 6: Understand dispatch management The NEM is centred around active power management every 5 minutes, 24/7 – and as such it is incredibly important to understand what the expected demand is, hence what generation will be required in the next 5 minutes. Once these fundamentals are understood, price is used to incentivise (or dis-incentivise) generation to generate more or less. It creates a dynamic that price will generally be higher when more generation will be required, and low when less generation is required in the next 5 minute period (there is never any ‘spare’ electricity even in the case of batteries – the power system is always balancing demand and supply such that it equals each other). Therefore, when we discuss how much generation is being installed, a mature discussion will also include factors such as ‘expected capacity factor’ , ‘expected generation profile’ , ‘volume weighted price expectation’ etc. In order to understand these types of variables, concepts such as marginal loss factors (MLFs), constrained generation and expected price when generating must be known – this is dispatch management! The general public (and some media) may not understand the difference between 200MW of Generator A (with a 35% capacity factor) and 200MW of Generator B (with a capacity factor of 75%) in terms of MW and MWh, but we in the industry must! Theme 7: Revenue management is more than locking in a PPA For (particularly) renewable project developments, a PPA will ensure a degree of revenue certainty for owners and financiers but ensuring those revenue outcomes still requires significant focus on spot market activities, as the participant’s MWh volume is not guaranteed (despite having numerous contracts in place for O&M etc). One such example is mitigating the cost of ancillary services levied on generators using the “Causer Pays” principle. Semi-scheduled generators are incentivised to follow their assigned dispatch target to minimise their resulting causer pays contribution factor and assigned share of FCAS regulation costs. Providing FCAS services is also an emerging opportunity for renewable generators to develop an alternative revenue stream where technically feasible. Theme 8: Business systems and processes matter The sophistication required of market participants to navigate the complexities of the market necessitates the development of appropriate systems and processes. The large volume of market data presents both a challenge and an opportunity to interpret and develop insights into market outcomes and drivers. Developing systems to utilise this data and engage with the market are key for effective and informed decision making. Business processes that support efficient market operations and meet the range of regulatory compliance obligations placed on market participants are also essential. Theme 9: Everything is possible (just a question of who pays and the risk) Having worked with all segments of the industry in recent years, we are seeing the traditional business model (i.e. of pushing all the costs further down the supply chain, with costs eventually ending at the consumer) is increasingly diminishing. This is happening, at least in part, because consumers can now do something different: they can generate their own electricity at a generally reasonable rate. The concept of pushing risk ‘anywhere but with me’ is leading to organisations accepting risks with little or no concept of what it entails, to get the deal done and then passing down the chain. It may also be engendering a culture within some organisations of pure contract management, hoping the lawyers have the technical detail correct, with little or no understanding of what the technical aspects really entail. As an industry, we need to be more sophisticated than this. Theme 10: There is no such thing as free electricity! It is important to appreciate that, as a fuel source, despite wind and solar not requiring any pre-processing prior to hitting the turbine blades or solar panels, that does not mean it is free ! Most wind and solar vendors will charge the owners of the plant a fixed variable fee per MWh, thereby instantly creating a marginal cost for every MWh generated. This fixed fee could be something like $5-$10/MWh or higher, remembering that this fee is spread across volume of operation, which might be less than initially forecast. On top of these charges, owner’s operations costs, maintenance, financing and the like all create a cost that need to be recovered in order for any business to be economically sustainable. Considering these themes, therefore, GVSC proposed the top 4 points for consideration for owners of new generation assets (or new owners of existing assets): About our Guest Authors Jonathon Dyson Simon Vanderzalm Jonathon has nearly 20 years practical experience in the Australian NEM, having held senior operational and trading roles in participant organisations and now as the Director of a specialist market consulting organisation, with a specific focus on renewable energy integration.

    "title": "A case study in Active Management at a Semi-Scheduled plant – Tuesday 24th July 2018 at Lake Bonney 2 Wind Farm",
    "date": "20-09-2018 06:52:00 AM",
    "content": "Over the past 18 months, there’s been a sizeable amount of new entrant wind and solar plant enter the National Electricity Market. Using NEMreview and this query , we see daily Registered Capacity for wind and large solar growing as follows: In parallel with this, we’ve been having an increasing number of conversations with new entrant generators who are coming to the pointy end of the construction process of their Semi-Scheduled wind and solar plant. Some of these new entrants have been coming onboard with our ez2view software, to help them actively manage the opportunities and risks for them present in the NEM. During a conversation late in July, I was using the Time-Travel functionality in ez2view to walk sequentially back through some interesting market events and I happened upon the afternoon of Tuesday 24th July 2018 (a period highlighted in the NEMreview trend below): At the time we were discussing the need to actively manage their bids submitted to AEMO – due to a number of factors, including risks relating to congestion, and negative price events. Coincidental, therefore, that we happened on two occasions in the afternoon of Tuesday 24th July that featured dispatch prices dropping to –$1,000/MWh and we noted the reaction of Lake Bonney 2 Wind Farm (another Semi-Scheduled plant) to that risk. To the person I was speaking with at the time, I promised to put an article together and post on WattClarity . It’s taken longer than I expected to find the time to do so, but here it is today. In putting this post together, we’ve used the “Time-Travel” function in conjunction with an “in development” version of ez2view that contains functionality not yet completed and delivered to clients. Given the intensive, ongoing but iterative development process we follow with the software , we’re always working on enhancements to the software in various ways. Using the software in analysis to prepare posts like this helps us fine-tune what we’re working on at the time, by continually asking ourselves “does this [NEW FUNCTIONALITY] make the complexity more understandable?” . Hence we’d be interested to hear directly from existing clients to see if what’s new in some of the images below (flagged) makes the story clearer? We’ll step through a number of dispatch intervals successively, to see what unfolds during the day. Our ez2view software allows the user to configure their own dashboard over multiple windows , so we’re going to use 2 windows to highlight various aspects of what was happening in the South Australian region of the NEM in that time. In doing this, keep in mind that the two instances of negative prices are for the 14:35 dispatch interval and the 16:05 dispatch interval . In both instances, these are the first dispatch intervals in a trading period, so offer more examples of generator revenue management due to the challenges associated with 5-minute dispatch and 30-minute settlement that are with us until 1st July 2021. We’ll look at each of these instances in the context of the whole trading period, and (importantly) what was visible in advance , particularly highlighting the active steps that Infigen Energy (the operator/participant) has taken in order to manage the risks inherent in both negative prices and specific constraints at the time. Readers are reminded that times here are in “NEM time”, which is UTC+10. (A) The 15:00 Trading Period (i.e. from 14:30:01 to 15:00:00) Using Time Travel in ez2view we’ve wound back to each of the 6 x dispatch intervals in the 15:00 trading period, plus one on either side, to present this longitudinal view (click on the image for a larger view): The key points to start with are that: 1) The dispatch price dropped to the Floor at 14:35, the first dispatch interval in the half hour – which delivered a trading price down at –$129.10/MWh (which, even allowing for revenue from LGCs, would seem to be an unprofitable price for any generator for that half hour). 2) This price drop was not envisaged in the P5 predispatch forecast produced prior to the first dispatch interval – hence we presume that all generators were surprised by the specific timing of it’s occurrence (even if they understood the risks of this happening were heightened because of wind patterns over that recent period). (A1) The 14:30 dispatch interval (before the trading period begins) If we load up another window from ez2view at 14:30 (this time containing a juxtaposition of several widgets) we see the conditions : I’ve flagged three things in the image: 1) Reiterating no price drop forecast at the time 2) Highlighting that the AEMO had triggered the Semi-Dispatch Cap on Lake Bonney 2 and Lake Bonney 3 (along with a long list of other generators, not shown) in order to notify them that they need to pay attention to their dispatch targets, as the AEMO requires them to do something in order to keep the system stable. We’ll have more of a look, later, at what AEMO was asking these plant to do – just need to flag that the SDC was triggered at this point.: (My) Layperson’s Description of the Semi-Dispatch Cap In response to the influx of intermittent generation supplies entering the NEM some years ago (back when it was mainly wind farms) a “Semi-Scheduled” registration classification was created at the AEMO. When (wind and solar) plant register at AEMO, they fit into this category. The way this works is that the Semi-Scheduled plant are required to bid into the market (almost) like fully Scheduled plant – in that they offer 10 bid bands and allocate quantities across the bid bands. However they do this on the basis of their physical capacity on the assumption that AEMO (through AWEFS and ASEFS) will adjust their volumes to what’s actually realistic in each dispatch interval in real time. This is notwithstanding the challenges inherent in 3rd party forecasts of plant output as discussed here . Most of the time, the wind & solar farms will just produce as much as the wind & sun allows (i.e. effectively not paying any attention to what their dispatch Target says, when calculated by NEMDE) – but occasionally AEMO might need them to operate in a certain way to ensure system stability. If this is the case, then this would be signified by AEMO triggering the “Semi-Dispatch Cap” for that particular DUID, which is a flag for the unit to “follow” their dispatch Target. When we say “follow” there is a difference, too, from the Scheduled plant, which have to hit their dispatch targets (i.e. not too high, nor too low). For the Semi-Scheduled plant, the Target effectively acts as a Cap – i.e. AEMO is telling them to “don’t produce any more than Target MW ” at the end of that dispatch interval. Clients using our ez2view software, when pointed at their own MMS (i.e. containing their own private data feed from AEMO) will have visibility in real time of their Semi-Dispatch Cap status and also their Dispatch Targets – plus the forecasts into predispatch as well. When using Time Travel we can (almost – see note at bottom of article ) have a complete view of what the participant might have been seeing in real time. ———————————————————– Important to note that batteries need to register as (fully) Scheduled plant, so this does not apply to them – indeed, their operations are more complex and need (very) Active Management. 3) It’s also noted that the “System Strength” constraint was bound at the time. We can click on the Constraint Equation name to open a new window to learn more about this particular constraint: I’ve highlighted here how Lake Bonney 2 and Lake Bonney 3 are amongst the 15 wind and solar stations that are being constrained down for System Strength reasons prior to the start of the trading period in question: Quick note about the System Strength constraint In the aftermath of the SA blackout of September 2016 , the AEMO has implemented some constraint equations that have the effect of constraining down intermittent (non-synchronous) generation in South Australia (i.e. when its very windy) to provide room for what they deem to be sufficient thermal plant to operate in order to provide enough “System Strength” on the grid to keep the system stable should unforseen events occur. This constraint tends to bind for hours at a time and returns every few days (i.e. coincident with the windy periods in SA). We expect it will become more prevalent in future , as more intermittent plant comes onto the grid in South Australia. Might also occur in other places as well (e.g. in North Queensland with the influx of solar plant). There have been several different forms of this constraint over the 2 year period since the blackout, with the latest form shown in the widget above. It may be that the form of the constraint continues to evolve over time – any such changes will be automatically reflected in the data conveyed through widgets in ez2view . Because of the lack of diversity of wind patterns across South Australia (and indeed the south-east corner of the NEM, more broadly) we see this System Strength constraint binding almost every week for hours at a time. In the ordinary course of events this means a lower yield from all of the Semi-Scheduled plant on the list (hence lower “black” revenue (lower volume and a suppressed spot price in a double whammy as a result of the “wind correlation penalty” ), and also lower LGC revenue as well – another risk to manage, but that’s food for another article). On this day, the concerns were a little bit different… (A2) The 14:35 dispatch interval (price drops to the floor) Step forward five minutes and we see a number of things (including the price drop down to the Market Price Floor of –$1,000/MWh ): Firstly let’s highlight the small change in bids at AGL’s Torrens Island B3 units. In this case (highlighted in mouse-over) the unit made more capacity available down at the Market Price Floor. Drilling into the “Station Dashboard Widget” (under active development) we see what impact that had on the station itself: So the extra volume offered down at –$1,000/MWh when it came online led to both: (a) a small (but quite significant) increase in dispatched volume at that plant itself; and (b) the lifting of the “System Strength” constraint*, which allowed wind farms to ramp up output further. * about the unbinding of the System Strength constraint In layman’s terms, the depth of the limitation on output of non-synchronous (but Semi-Scheduled) plant in South Australia under this constraint is determined by combinations of different synchronous units that are online at the time. By coming back online, the TIPS B3 unit added to the number of synchronous units (even if at low output) and so the constraint was relaxed. This is done through a “swamping” term on the Right-Hand Side (RHS). Further details are shown in the two images below from that particular widget in ez2view. This combination of increased output (i.e. a bit from TIPS B3, which allowed a lot more from wind and solar) crashed the price through the floor. Here’s where you can see the gory details of the Right-Hand Side (RHS) of that constraint in ez2view : If I sit back I can almost see the news headline in an article that would probably never be written: “Not-so-greedy (at least this time) thermal generator gives away more capacity, ensuring greater output from wind farms and delivering negative prices for consumers”. So despite the fact that the System Strength constraint was no longer material in this dispatch interval, we see that Lake Bonney 2 and Lake Bonney 3 were still subject to constraints, and (in fact) two of them, highlighted in the image above. It’s the constraint “S::V_TBSE_TBSE_2” that is of most interest to us in review of what happened on 24th July: The reason for this is because this constraint is acting to wind up the output of Lake Bonney 2 and Lake Bonney 3! In layman’s terms, SA was exporting to VIC (because of lots of wind). These are seen as negative flows in NEMDE. Because of this, AEMO is trying to ensure that generation in the South-East of South Australia is generating as much as possible in order to cover transient stability risk in the south-east. However neither Snuggery nor Ladbroke Grove are operating at present (and Canunda and Lake Bonney 1 are Non-Scheduled), hence the music stops, and Lake Bonney 2/3 don’t have a chair. With the dispatch price at –$1,000/MWh they are being asked to “take one for the team” and generate as much as they can to keep the system stable. Here’s the same Station Dashboard view for Lake Bonney 2: Remembering that the estimated trading price for the half-hour was down at –$125.74/MWh (i.e. not down at –$1,000/MWh, but still real money to fork out for the privilege of generating) this would calculated out at an amount of $7,104.31 that the participant (Infigen) would need to pay for generation over the half hour, especially because AEMO was asking them to ramp up! No wonder that these plant, and a number of others, were seen to rebid in the next dispatch interval. An example of the need for Semi-Scheduled plant to actively manage their risk! (A3) The 14:40 dispatch interval (price recovers, but offer re-priced and output curtailed) Here’s the summary view, 5 minutes later: It’s scope for more analysis (and hence food for another article on WattClarity sometime) but we note that some portfolios did rebid whilst others did not. Whilst recognising the inherent impossibility of knowing a participant’s motivation (and also recognising potential for error in manual cut-and-paste), it does not help us wondering what this behaviour could tell us about the exposures of each of these portfolios, and their capacity/motivation to actively respond to market events: Here’s the view of rebidding at Lake Bonney 2 for the 14:40 dispatch interval: (A4) A question emerges… The above was pretty much the essence of what I envisaged posting to deliver what I promised to in my conversation to the new entrant in late July. Job done, I thought initially… However perhaps by the virtue of time to think further (or because the enhancement to the “Station Dashboard” widget made it clearer) I noticed something in particular, relating to the “Initial MW” field for the Lake Bonney 2 project – highlighted here with the same widget focused on the 14:40 dispatch interval, just with an additional comment added : Remember that “Initial MW” is a snapshot taken at the start of a dispatch interval indicating where AEMO sees the unit to be, whereas the “Target” is what the AEMO wants the unit to be generating at the end of the period (albeit for Semi-Scheduled plant it is more like “don’t generate more than X”). As noted in the comment, it seems like AEMO was asking Lake Bonney 2 to ramp up (wind permitting) to 91MW by 14:35 (i.e. at the end of the 14:35 dispatch interval) and yet their Initial MW for the 14:40 dispatch interval (i.e. snapshot taken at the start of the dispatch interval) suggests that their output went the other way. As highlighted in this particular image, the Lake Bonney 2 wind farm was already sitting at 0MW at the start of the 14:40 dispatch interval. Yet, in the prior dispatch interval: 1) Lake Bonney 2 had offered all of its capacity in at –$1,000/MWh and, as such 2) The dispatch target that resulted was such that AEMO expected that the plant increase its output (as much as the wind conditions would allow). I wonder whether I missed something big, and would ask the more learned of our readers to please weigh in with comments (below, or offline) if you know of things I have missed? (A5) … hence we delved into the 4-second SCADA data again to confirm our hunch Notwithstanding that we’d bumped into a few warts in the 4-second SCADA data the last time we tried to use it , and that we’re very much in training wheels in how it is structured (and in terms of when to use it, and when not to ) I thought it would be educational for us to have a look at what the SCADA data showed us for the same period. Here’s what we pieced together for the Lake Bonney 2 station: Note in the chart I have time-shifted the “Initial MW” numbers to coincide with the measurement point at the start of the dispatch interval (i.e. where the SCADA snapshot is supposed to be taken). As it turns out, this lines up pretty well with the 4-second SCADA data. There is a big assumption inherent in the above, notwithstanding that alignment (i.e. we assume that the time stamps on the SCADA data are exactly correct). Assuming that this is the case, it appears that the ramp down started at Lake Bonney 2: (a) Well within the 14:35 dispatch interval (which is not what would seem to have been the undertaking in the bids used for that dispatch interval); and (b) Might have event started slightly before the rebid was submitted for 14:40. This observation is ringing bells inside my head, highlighting that there must be something here that I am overlooking – or have misunderstood. Out of curiosity, we looked at Lake Bonney 3 and saw a similar pattern: Also interesting to note here that (as highlighted in the table above) there was no change of volume offered for the 14:40 dispatch interval for Lake Bonney 3 (unlike Lake Bonney 2) and yet the volume was still curtailed prior to the end of the 14:35 dispatch interval. Finally, for completeness we include the trend of SCADA output data for Lake Bonney 1: Being Non-Scheduled, there’s not as much data relevant to that station (but we do see that the ramp-down was much more gradual, and wonder if that was because of contract cover or for some other reason). (A6) Recapping my understanding of the sequence of events at Lake Bonney 2 and Lake Bonney 3 As noted in these images, the rebid Lake Bonney 2 was accompanied by a reason “1430~A~SA PRICE DP@1435 1058.39 LWR THN 5PD@1430 FOR 1435 SL~” which makes it pretty clear that the drop in the dispatch price to –$1,000/MWh for 14:35 was the reason claimed for shifting volume to the market price cap. Lake Bonney 3 was tagged with the same rebid – but (unless I am missing something) nothing changed in their bid. We’ve put together the following sequence of events to reflect our understanding (noting that it may be that we have misunderstood something, and would appreciate people pointing this out for us, if they can please): As noted in the table above, the ramping down of Lake Bonney 2 and Lake Bonney 3 appears to start prior to the rebid for Lake Bonney 2 being time-stamped by the AEMO, and 2.5-3 minutes before the end of the dispatch interval in which the targets for the units were for an increase in output. (A7) Questions about specifics of Active Management, specifically relating to “Bidding in Good Faith” At this point, I’ve bumped into the limit of my understanding – and am hoping that some of our more learned readers might be able to point me to any case where the AER has analysed and reported on similar behaviour to what seems to have happened here on 24th July? I am very deliberate in using the “seems to have” phrase, as it may be that I have made some error in the data above (I hope not – but if so, please let us know urgently!) or made some mistake in its interpretation (perhaps more likely – but still please do let us know). As the Semi-Dispatch Cap was triggered for both units at the time, it was a requirement that they “follow” the dispatch target – with my understanding being that “follow” effectively means don’t exceed. Hence, in that sense curtailing down to 0MW before the end of the dispatch interval would presumably not be seen as contravening the dispatch target. What puzzles me is that “bidding in good faith” would actually mean for a Semi-Scheduled plant operating in circumstances like these. Given the bids down at –$1,000/MWh were taken account of by NEMDE in calculating the dispatch outcomes for 14:35, I could understand an argument being made that bids for Lake Bonney 2 and Lake Bonney 3 might not have been in “good faith” if the operator seems to demonstrate that they don’t like the outcome by curtailing output before the end of the dispatch interval, and (slightly later) submitting a rebid noting the price change. Seems to be a bit of a grey area? It would be great if there was some readers out there who could help me out on this one, please? Quick note about (my understanding of) ”Bidding in Good Faith” My layman’s understanding of what “bidding in good faith” means is that the generator needs to be genuinely prepared to honour the bid if called onto dispatch in that dispatch interval. This followed a rule change proposal submitted by the Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy (of South Australia) on 13th November 2013 which referenced the earlier Federal Court decision in August 2011 (link here to come) relating to a case brought by the AER against Stanwell Corporation for bidding behaviour on 22nd and 23rd February 2008 ( outcomes of which we happened to capture here on WattClarity at the time , and I note that our software has come along way over the 10 years since). On 10th December 2015, the AEMC made a final rule to enhance the arrangement that govern all generator’s offers in the wholesale market. Details are here on the AEMC’s website , but my understanding is that: 1) It increased the requirements for contemporaneous documentations; and 2) Applied to Semi-Scheduled plant as well as Scheduled plant. (B) The 16:30 Trading Period Assembling this article has already taken long enough (far longer than initially envisaged in that conversation with a new entrant back at the end of July), but it is worth presenting the same style of longitudinal view of prices for the 16:30 trading period, we see a similar story – with the dispatch price dropping to the floor in the first dispatch interval in the period. What was different this time is that the AEMO P5 forecast was also flagging that the prices for the remaining 5 x dispatch intervals in the trading period would also have been so low – meaning an estimated trading price for that half-hour down at –$1,000/MWh . It’s entirely understandable that all generators (or at least the party in the commercial arrangement that wears the risk) wants to avoid paying so much to generate (for instance, we have other quite small generators who are clients who have an automated data feed from us to turn them off when the price drops negative – reverse Demand Response, in a way) . With the bigger generators that are involved in the dispatch process as Scheduled or Semi-Scheduled, they need to do this through the bidding and dispatch process. Again loading up the same window focused on Lake Bonney 2 Wind Farm and focusing on he 16:10 dispatch interval (i.e. after the price drop at 16:05), we see what appears to be the same behaviour: Puzzling… Looking forward to hearing from our learned readers who can point out what I have got wrong, or misunderstood, please? Finally, it’s also worth noting (a little off the topic of this particular incident) that the right column in the table in the widget is coded to show P5 predispatch data, if it is available. It will show a participants own predispatch in real time (we know this) and should show all “old” forecasts from day after (like in the image above) – however the AEMO does not even publish this day-after, despite it being labelled “Public”. Something we are following up with them about…",

    "title": "Further analysis of the (very rare) double-islanding events of Saturday 25th August 2018",
    "date": "06-09-2018 01:33:00 PM",
    "content": "The islanding of Queensland and South Australia from the rest of the NEM on Saturday 25 August ( noted on WattClarity on Saturday, as it was occurring ) was certainly one of the more significant events in the NEM’s history. Islanding events of individual regions in the past 20 years of the NEM have thankfully been rare, let alone islanding of multiple regions. As noted to one of the journalists who called that weekend, I can’t remember that happening before (still not have had time to check to be definitive). Whilst the event is still being investigated by AEMO (we understand an initial report is imminent), we fielded a number of requests for further information. So as time has allowed (and with a bit – a lot* – of external assistance) we have put this together this post to explore some of the aspects of what happened that are of interest to us. * Full Disclosure – the good insights here are not from me, but the mistakes probably are! We are increasingly working with a range of external resources to help extend our understanding of the NEM, and capacity to analyse events like this. In this case, much of this work was done by a couple of Analysts who would rather not share the spotlight. In this case, any good insights in this post come from them – whilst any mistakes made are almost certainly mine. In the case of this analysis and post, we have done this primarily because we’re passionately curious to learn more – and as it helps to drive our software further. We’ve posted it here as it might also help others: 1) those new participants in the market, 2) a growing number of interested observers and commentators, and 3) perhaps even the old hands. If you also have the (capability and) interest to help us in this way, please do give us a call and let us know – tel +61 7 3368 4064 . A high-level summary of the event: The separation event occurred around 13:12 AEST, with both the NSW-QLD and Vic-SA interconnector tripping (**see possible explanation below of why Heywood tripped in sympathy ) ; Load shedding occurred in three regions due to automatic under-frequency load shedding arrangements and included 724 MW in NSW, 280 MW in Vic and 80 MW in Tasmania. SA was resynchronised at 13:37 (constraints revoked in 14:45 dispatch interval), and Qld at 1420 (revoked in 14:45 interval); High FCAS prices in both Qld and SA up to $14,500 / MWh as a result of these services having to be sourced locally (ie within the region); and No large generation (>200MW) was lost, although some smaller units tripped, with some large thermal generators in Qld rebidding to manage the output of their units which were affected with the frequency management of the power system. We have based this particular post on the NEM 5-minute and 30-minute data, as opposed to the 4-second Causer Pays Data which we posted about here . (A) Pre-conditions and Initiating Event We understand from comments from Paul Italiano (CEO of Transgrid last Saturday in the AFR here ), that lightning struck the two main transmission lines in northern NSW that make up the Queensland to NSW Interconnector (QNI) around 13:11:50 on Saturday, 25 August 2018. According to Paul’s comments, it struck the same ‘phase’ on each of the lines which is unusual, thereby creating an electrical fault on the lines which then needs to be ‘cleared’ by the power system elements. Although at the time of the event this was classified as non-credible contingency (it has subsequently been reclassified as a credible contingency now), it should still have been ‘ridden through’ by all generators. Unfortunately, despite early reports of no generation loss, there were some generators that did trip, but this is discussed later in this post. For the 13:15 interval (which signifies time-ending 13:15, which is released around 13:10) the power system conditions in Qld and SA were relatively stable, as shown in these schematics from ez2view : QLD Region SA Region Click on the images above to see the details. We’ve only shown QLD and SA here, as these are the regions we have focused analysis on (it would be worthwhile as a further follow up to look into NSW, VIC and TAS, but this will only be if more time permits later…). Important aspects to note prior to the event: SA was sending ~260MW to VIC (with a limit of approx. 500MW), QLD was sending ~900MW at near full capacity, Basslink was export a maximum of 478MW to VIC from TAS. Wind in SA and VIC was quite low, as was demand (minimum for the day had been reached in SA at a low 725MW due to high levels of Solar PV across the NEM ~3000MW) Energy prices in all regions was between $69-$80 on the mainland ($9 in Tas under full export on Basslink), with FCAS prices below $20/MWh in all mainland regions for raise and lower services) Interestingly, there were no Qld generators enabled for lower services (5min, 60sec and 6sec contingency services or lower regulation) See the example below from ez2view showing that enablement target of Lower Reg services locally in Queensland had dropped to 0MW earlier that day: This may come up as a further issue along the lines of Kate Summers post here on Tuesday 28th August (coincidentally following the islanding). Similarly there were no generators enabled for raise services in Tasmania. The lack of lower FCAS services procured locally in QLD meant that, in the case of QNI trip (as was the case on the day) there would be no-one locally in Queensland contracted to reduce frequency. Even apart from this, my understanding (thanks to those who have explained) is that the dispatch signals would have been sent initially with reference to the frequency in Sydney in any case, until the frequency reference point for “NEM North” was reset to Queensland. Hence, until that change was made, my understanding is that there would not have been any signals sent to reduce frequency in the QLD region (*see correction), as the reference frequency was seen as dropping (not increasing, as it would have done in reality). * PS, and correction One knowledgeable reader has pointed out an error in the last paragraph above, because: (1) Whilst Regulation Lower service would have been dispatched centrally, hence not dispatched in a QLD with (actual) rising frequency if the opposite was being observed because of the observation point; but (2) The Contingency Lower services would have triggered, as they do so based on local frequency. Thanks for that correction! (B) At the event The event occurred around 13:11:52, as highlighted in the post last Monday . With frequency heading in two different directions (i.e. up sharply in QLD and SA, and down sharply in NSW+VIC) it might be useful for some readers to review this refresher in what the implications were: Although the 4sec data is very good for many things (and is used for Causer Pays Factor Calculations), we have found there are errors associated with it: There are obvious time delays and mis-matches between timestamps; The Heywood interconnector (Vic-SA) flow was showing MW transfer for a further 40seconds compared to what we understand now (the interconnector tripped within a few seconds of QNI tripping (**see possible explanation)); The 4sec data for the Hornsdale battery shows no generation, yet the high-speed Tesla data (initially posted on RenewEconomy and then copied in here ) indicates an expected response; and The NEM north and NEM south frequencies are clearly not inclusive of Qld and SA (and only show NSW and Vic?) **PS, and possible explanation Another knowledgeable reader has explained what the cause of the Heywood trip might have been – which is essentially the automated trip (due to an automated protection system) in response to the rapid increase in flow eastwards on Heywood that would have resulted after flow south on QNI was cut. Paraphrasing the explanation (so apologies if I mess it up): (1) The protection system had been in place for more than a decade to cater for a differently envisaged scenario (e.g. the link from Portland smelter to Melbourne is cut, hence massively increasing the load on the South Australian system and increasing flow east from SA); but (2) In essence (it seems) what unfolded on 25th August was a scenario not really envisaged when that protection scheme was put in place. Thanks for that addition! Under such a scenario, the frequency in SA would have firstly dived (in conjunction with NSW+VIC) but then, after the trip of Heywood, jumped back up above 50Hz. This would have caused fast-responding plant to swing similarly. Hence the swing in output shown in the HPR charts from Tesla/Neoen. (C) Immediately following interval (13:20) The following screens for QLD and SA show the next Dispatch Interval (13:20), with all units highlighted in red having changed generation by more than 15% (with a couple trips). Note in ez2view we use colour (amongst other techniques) to draw your attention to what’s important – a red colour highlights a change by more than 15% up, or down: QLD Region SA Region It is possible to see the event un-folding in the data; All energy and FCAS prices in 13:20 remain roughly the same as 13:15 In the images above, we see that NEMDE is still showing non-zero dispatch target flow for the 13:15 dispatch interval over QNI and Heywood: This is despite the fact that the links have tripped just prior to the start of the dispatch interval It’s been suggested that this might be a function of the DATASNAP process AEMO do to capture all the inputs to their NEMDE process There are numerous changes seen in generation output in Queensland, with reference to the SCADA data sampling time (i.e. around 13:15, leading into the dispatch interval): We see many large thermal units significantly reducing their output – we assume that this is in response to high frequency (though we note, as above, that none of them were contracted to provide FCAS Lower Services) Several generators in Qld seem to have tripped – (Condamine (Gas) and Whitsunday (Solar)) – and other semi-scheduled plant experienced large changes (Collinsville PV (Solar), Hamilton and Kidston (Solar)), but this might have been natural variation due to local cloud cover. In the two schematics (via live intra-regional flow data provided through us from Powerlink and ElectraNet) we see major changes in flow in the network, as would be expected: In Queensland all the flows are lit up, except (curiously) Central West to Gladstone Similarly in South Australia. (D) Next dispatch interval (13:25) Given the time into the 13:15 dispatch interval that the event occurred, it took the following dispatch interval, 13:25, before AEMO was able to invoke network constraints that represented the prevailing physical conditions in the NEMDE model. Under such separation conditions, AEMO invoke network constraints that tell NEMDE that the regions are separated. Between the 13:15 interval and 13:25, nearly 200 additional constraints were invoked to reflect these conditions. Critically, many of the invoked constraints were not only binding (a marginal value <> 0), but were violating , meaning NEMDE could not find a suitable solution. Once the new constraints were invoked, NEMDE calculated new pricing outcomes and things began to get interesting (the below screenshots show the binding (red) constraints before and after the event – note the Violation Degree (VD) column is non-zero! ) in the 2 pages of critical constraints for the 13:25 interval. Constraints invoked at 13:20 Constraints invoked at 13:25 In this particular widget within ez2view , we use colour to flag constraints that are bound (yellow) or significantly bound (red) . We can see without even clicking to expand the escalation in the sheer number of constraints bound, hence indicating the seriousness of the situation… For SA, the physical separation lasted ~25 minutes, whereas for Qld, it was an hour and 10 minutes. However, it was not until 14:45 in Qld that the last of the separation constraints were removed and the market resumed ‘normal’ operation. Therefore, we have broken the analysis into post event (while SA and Qld were separated), post SA restoration (Qld still isolated), and all restored. (E) Both QLD and SA separated With the newly invoked network constraints, energy and FCAS prices started to change in both SA and QLD, as shown below (we have excluded Tasmania since its prices were largely the same). There was a short period of price volatility in the energy market in SA (very low prices given it had excess generation as it was an exporting region at the time), with some high FCAS prices in SA, but mostly in QLD. (F) QLD Generators Qld generators initial rebids were mostly plant related (CPSA to bid off, Gladstone for boiler control issues), but also to match the capacity of their Units with the output of the Units which would have been pushed around with high frequency. Some rebid to lower price bands, presumably to try and counter constraints were also occurring (ie Kogan Creek). A snapshot of the bidding at the time of the event shows some of the rebid reasons: Later, some generators also adjusted the FCAS offers in response to what was happening in the FCAS markets although in general there was an inadequate supply of FCAS for the Qld in all FCAS services (we can tell this from the difference between the RRP and RRP prices – we will leave for another time). Coal Generators Coal generators showing a decline in load at most stations, initially when the event occurred, and over the course of the separation. Gas Generators Many started while Queensland was in an island state. These included: Oakey Braemar 1 Braemar 2 Roma CPSA came off immediately after the start of the event, but then returned to service approx. 30 minutes later. There were various reasons for starting, depending on the participant. Some were unrelated to the event, such as in the case of Arrow (Braemar 2) quoting “fuel management : Increase in expected gas deliveries”; whereas others such as Origin Energy (Roma 7) quoting “Constraint Management – QN_ZERO – SL”. Hydro Stations Kareeya had a significant drop in load at the start of the event but then resumed its normal load 20 minutes later. The drop in load presumably in response to high system frequency. Large Solar. There was a 100 MW drop in Large Solar at 13:20. Some came off line, such as: Barcaldine Clare CSPVPS Whitsunday (interestingly, we note that this unit seemed to be generating with no volume in any price band?) Others reduced in load initially at the start of the event, and slowly came back up to where they were before. Rooftop Solar PV There was also a 150-200MW drop in small Solar in Qld around the same time, although it is difficult with the prevailing data to determine the extent to which this was due to the event, or it it was irradiance related (although you will note the drop around 11:30, which happens most days is a far more gradual decline which suggests irradiance). The drop in SA and through the mainland is far more pronounced than in Queensland. All Mainland Regions Queensland Region only SA Region only In this case, we have used the AEMO’s estimates for Rooftop solar (but note the caveat previously posted about the opacity of small-scale PV ). Liquid Fuel Mackay GT started twice during the event, but shutdown a short while later each time. Rebids In Queensland there was some changes in volume across bid bands on some generators as the co-optimisation occurred between energy and FCAS (delivering relatively low energy price, but high FCAS prices). In some instances, rebids were also accompanied by changes in availability of the services, with many bidding more volume to lower bands to try and counter the constraints that were acting on the generators. Looking at Dispatch outcome and rebid reasons on the day from CS Energy, it was evident that some power stations were certainly being moved around by the frequency changes. Energy and FCAS Rebids submitted for Callide and Gladstone Units shortly after the event included words such as “Technical issues – Boiler control issues – QNI trip” as shown above. The effect of the rebids included reductions in availability of the Units. For Gladstone the reductions were quite significant, down 1465 MW to 1031 MW for the Station, and for Callide B 650 MW to 602 MW. The FCAS capability of Gladstone was also significantly reduced during this time such that it was unable to provide the level of services it was before the event. Callide, despite some reduced energy generation, was able to operate near full availability to provide FCAS services and set the $14,200/MWh for many intervals, as shown below in the price setter display from ez2view : (G) SA Generation Given the separation event was far shorter for the SA region than QLD, we haven’t focussed too much on the outcomes in this region. There did not appear to be any major rebidding from AGL’s Torrens Island, although the AGL wind portfolio was bid to lower prices levels due to ‘UNFCAST NETWORK CONSTRAINT~HEYWOOD TRIP’ . The Hornsdale Power Reserve continued to operate through the period, although its rebid reasons did highlight that its ‘energy in the tank’ may have been low , as the rebid reason ‘.. SOC [state of charge] LIMIT’ was used regularly through the afternoon. (H) In conclusion … There has been a lot of discussion on the event, which is spurring us to (with some external assistance – thanks very much) delve further into the data so we can understand more, and drive our software further. We hope that the analysis shared here will also be of use to our readers. We (and/or some guest authors ) might have more to share in the coming weeks As always, any questions, please give us a call: tel +61 7 3368 4064",

    "title": "Taking a look at Saturday’s Islanding Event through 4 second SCADA data",
    "date": "27-08-2018 04:02:00 PM",
    "content": "There was a fair bit of interest shown in the islanding event of Saturday 25th August, including in these initial notes here on WattClarity from early that afternoon . The following exchange on Twitter was one of many on social media over the weekend, with this one highlighted because of the questions I flagged: Coincident with this event, we’ve been starting to explore the inclusion of NEM 4-second SCADA data, published by the AEMO, into our product suite (definitely in some form via ez2view , perhaps also in NEMreview , maybe in something new). Hence we saw the events over the weekend as one way we could drag ourselves up the learning curve with respect to this data set, and what it could show us: 1) About the events of the weekend; and also 2) How we should be utilising the data to further help our clients view our products. Hence (with the assistance of some of the external consultants we use to drive our products forward) we have had a quick look at some sample SCADA data from around the time of the incident, and present the following thoughts for consideration. Reader beware, however: my “Training Wheels” are very much in place in dealing with this data set, so it is quite probable that I have made mistakes in interpretation of the data. If you pick up any mistakes, it would be most helpful to us (so we, in turn, can better help our clients by making better software) if you could give us a call directly (+61 7 3368 4064) so you can help me understand what I’ve messed up. Thanks, in advance! Keeping that (big disclaimer) in mind, we hope this will be of some use: 1) Interconnector flows Looking firstly at interconnector flows, we prepared the following chart: First thing to note about this chart, and most of the others below, is that the cover (just) a 3 minute period within the 14:15 dispatch interval . This period (from 13:10:52 to 13:14:05) incorporates 48 sequential 4-second SCADA readings. With these readings there are, unfortunately, delays that occur in the time-stamping of the data, which leads to difficulties in precise sequencing of events along the lines of “this happened and then that happened”… There are four main things we can see in the chart above: Observation #1 = we see that the QNI flow dropped from 866MW south to 0MW over a period of less than 16 seconds. This happened in two steps – first to 50% and then to 0%. I wonder if this is not indication of the “mal-operation” that AEMO referenced in Market Notice 64012 published at 17:52 on Saturday 25th (i.e. was it meant to reduce to 1/2 load and stay there?) “ External Reference Cancellation of a Non-Credible Contingency Event: Simultaneous trip of 8L and 8M Dumaresq – Bulli 330 kV Transmission lines as a credible contingency lines in NSW due to protection mal-operation. Cancellation of reclassification of a non-credible contingency event as a credible contingency event due to protection mal-operation.” Observation #2 = we see that, as QNI was coming offline, flow north from Victoria and Tasmania increased to try to compensate – and yet Heywood is not seen to do anything. I wonder why this was the case? Observation #3 = we see that Heywood apparently remained operating (and at a steady rate) for a full 50 seconds before tripping. Why it tripped I still don’t understand – especially if it happened to trip a full 50 seconds afterwards? Observation #4 = we see that (according to the data), the frequency in “NEM North” (i.e. Queensland) did not climb through the roof as I would have expected. Instead, if we expand out the time-range below, we see that the data suggests that this did not happen until 13:19 – I do not understand how there could be such a time-lag? Was this due to a time-stamping problem? It certainly seems that there might be some form of measurement, or time-stamping, problem? 2) Major loads Next, taking a look at load at three aluminium smelters, in conjunction with the frequency: Observation #5 = we see the Automated Under-Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) system triggered reductions in load at both Tomago Smelter (in NSW) and at Portland Smelter (in VIC). Observation #6 = worth also noting that the output at Boyne did not drop, which is what we expected. It’s also another indication that there is an error in the data for frequency at “NEM North”, as the output increases slightly (does not drop) coincident with the trip of QNI (i.e. Observation #4). 3) Selected Generators Starting with a stack of output at selected larger Queensland generators, we see that their cumulative output ramped down quickly in response to the trip of QNI – as I had expected to see: Observation #7 = total reduction shown in the chart is 608MW, which is lower than the loss of access to the NSW region (866MW) – but I suspect that this is just because we’re not 100% correct in the stations selected. Have not checked thoroughly… Observation #8 = I’ve also noted that there looks like a trip at Kidston Solar Project, which might have happened in response to the high frequency we think QLD would have been seeing at the time (but is not shown in the chart above, as noted in Observation #4). A small point, but this is also a slight deviation from the AEMO said in Market Notice 63985 where they noted NIL generation tripped with the event (we presume the most attention was focused on the bigger generators). Taking a sample of the bigger generators across some regions, we see the following: Observation #9 = The way that both Kogan (reduced quickly with presumed frequency rise) and Bayswater #3 (increased quickly with frequency drop) appear to have performed is as we expected. Observation #10 = However the “up then down” output of Loy Yang A1 & A4, along with Bayswater #2, are a little more puzzling for me. Perhaps I am missing something? Taking a look at a mix of smaller plant, we have the following chart: There are a number of things that seem to make sense in this chart, and some things that don’t: Observation #11 = It seems that Gladstone Unit 6 output reduced quickly in response to a presumed spike in frequency – however it just as quickly increased output, which is something that does not immediately make sense. Perhaps I am missing something? Observation #12 = We see that output from all 4 x Torrens B units increases sharply (which seems to make sense if Heywood was still connected at that time – however the trend of flow above seems to suggest no increased flow to the east) but then reduces just as quickly (which does not make as much sense). Perhaps I am missing something? Observation #13 = We see that output from Gordon increases sharply to supply the mainland, and this seems to line up with the temporary increase in flow north on Basslink (i.e. in the time it took for Portland smelter to trip). Observation #14 = Two things that are puzzling are that the batteries (Hornsdale, and Dalrymple) don’t behave as would be expected if frequency in South Australia was to drop sharply whilst still connected to Victoria. Again, this might have something to do with my same puzzlement about Heywood flow not being seen to change for 50 seconds (Observation #3)? PS interesting that also on Monday this article was posted on RenewEconomy and included two charts focused specifically on the Hornsdale battery over two periods following the separation event. The charts contain 100 milli-second data (so presumably coming from Tesla or Neoen), so are at an even better resolution than the 4 second data provides. Here’s the first one, marked up with some comments (click on the image for a larger view): Here’s the second one, again with some comments (click on the image for a larger view): A couple points: 1) Readers should note that the “output” data has been re-zeroed to show change in rate of charge/discharge relative to where it was at when QNI tripped (i.e. was charging then at approx -40MW) 2) The data is more like I expected to see, so I wonder what’s the reason the 4-second data does not show the jump to a discharge of approximately 40MW (i.e. 80MW change) within the first few seconds. 3) Where I’ve annotated that (according to the 4-second data) Heywood tripped, I would have expected to see frequency in the (then islanded) SA region jump again, as it had been supplying VIC. However that does not seem to be the case, which makes me wonder if the trip was not earlier than the 4-second data seems to suggest? Alas more questions… Finally, taking a look at some wind and solar plant reveals a few more questions, unfortunately… Observation #15 = Of the plant selected, it appears that 6 intermittent plant (5 solar farms and 1 wind farm) all dropped output coincident with the interconnector trip (with one tripping entirely) – but none of these have been (registered for or) enabled for FCAS. Hence this would suggest some form of technical fault at each of the plant, unless I am misunderstanding something? Please accept my apologies that this post seems to pose more questions than provide answers at this point. Unfortunately I am still puzzling at many things currently…",

    "content": "Worth a quick post, whilst it is happening, to note that both Queensland and South Australia have been islanded from (what remains of) the NEM for reasons unknown at this point in time. Here’s four images from NEMwatch v10 today: First, we have a Market Notice issued at 13:46 to note that the coincident separation events occurred at 13:12 today (i.e. 34 minutes before the notice was issued): Note the 1,080 MW total loss of load (presumably via automated under-frequency load shedding ) – being 800MW in NSW and 280MW in Victoria. This will have happened because both QLD and SA were exporting into NSW+VIC at the time of the links tripping, as a result of which: 1) Frequency drops in VIC+NSW 2) Frequency rises in QLD 3) Frequency rises in SA, probably by more than in QLD because of smaller-sized region. (remember this explainer here on WattClarity about how frequency changes with changes in the balance between supply and demand, and remember this happens very quickly – well within the 5-minute dispatch intervals). Second image is a trend of the target flow over the larger (Heywood) AC interconnector from Victoria to South Australia. As flagged on the image, Heywood had been flowing east over the day prior (because of high wind) but had been trailing down quite quickly as the wind faded. This meant lower drop in supply into Victoria (hence lower loss of load in VIC, though this is coincidence). Third image is a zoomed-in view of flow on the QNI interconnector, showing that the target flow and limits dropped to 0MW in the 13:25 dispatch interval (which was the same as for Heywood above): We note that Queensland had been exporting roughly 800MW at 13:15, which is the size of the load shed in NSW. We also note that, at the time the image was taken (14:10 dispatch interval) the interconnection had still not been restored. As noted in the image, this is not a simple thing to do, as it requires AEMO to align the frequencies in the two “islands” before reconnecting. Final image is a snapshot from NEMwatch taken for the 13:40 dispatch interval (i.e. before the Market Notice above issued) showing some price gyrations resulting in both QLD and SA – and also the loss of load in VIC+NSW: No time for more… What will be particularly of interest is why the two interconnectors tripped at the same time . PS, from AEMO it’s worth linking in this note here on the AEMO website , which explains some of what happened on Saturday. 2nd PS worth also linking in further analysis completed on Monday , which really just seems to raise more questions than it answers. 3rd PS also worth also linking in this subsequent analysis completed on Thursday 6th September , with some assistance from a couple other analysts. 4th PS will link in the draft of the AEMO report, when it is available.",

    "title": "Confirmation of yesterday’s supposition that some wind farms are blinking in the face of negative prices",
    "date": "10-08-2018 10:42:00 AM",
    "content": "Yesterday I posted a short article about the “wind correlation penalty” that’s been sending prices negative in South Australia over the past few days – and speculated (based on the only data visible in real time) that some wind farms appeared to be responding by shifting volume to higher priced bands in order to avoid the financial damage caused by the negative prices. This comment yesterday from Allan O’Neil ( guest author on WattClarity and independent consultant) prompted me to have a quick look this morning at what actually happened. I’ve included two snapshots from ez2view wound back to 12:10 yesterday via the “Time Travel” functionality to see what happened with the South Australian wind farms in response to negative prices in the 12:00 dispatch interval (dropping the 12:00 trading price below zero) and the 12:05 dispatch interval (suggesting, at that time yesterday, the trading price would also be below zero). In the first image, we see the $ symbols light up on the schematic to indicate that a number of plant rebid in the 12:10 dispatch interval: Even with the effect of the rebids (which shift the 12:10 dispatch price back above zero) the estimated trading price for the 12:30 trading period is still down at –$90.58/MWh . In the second image we take a quick look at more of the bid data for wind farms across South Australia: We see that there were 662MW of wind farm bids across 7 stations and 3 portfolios (roughly half of the total volume offered) shifted from –$1,000/MWh into higher priced bid bands in response to the drop in dispatch price in the 12:05 dispatch interval. To follow a couple conversations for new entrants recently, operating Semi-Scheduled plant in the NEM is not a passive role – not now, and certainly not in future as things like the “wind correlation penalty” and the “solar correlation penalty” begin to bite harder.",

    "content": "An hour ago today I tweeted this snapshot from NEMwatch v10 at the 12:00 dispatch interval to highlight another instance of the “wind correlation penalty” striking all generation output in South Australia over the past couple of days: This is a phenomenon we’re taking an increased interest in, as we are helping a growing number of new entrant generators in the NEM (even – as I noted at our first Quarterly Highlights session a weeks ago – down to some relatively small ones that are well below the threshold for being scheduled, but still have some merchant exposure so have us helping them to turn off when the price is negative – reverse demand response , if you like). Taking a closer look at our way-more-powerful ez2view dashboard focused on the South Australian region a little while later, I noted a sharp drop in output at a number of the wind farms in South Australia coincident with successive trading periods down around the Market Price Floor . Seen here intentionally paused at the 12:25 dispatch interval we see the 12:05 dispatch price was –$1,000/MWh (to follow the –$984.47 captured for 12:00 above), meaning 2 trading periods in a row with price below the recovery price of an LGC: Remembering that it is not possible to know a participants motivation when you’re sitting on the outside looking in like we do, it does seem that there are a couple wind farmers who are beginning to blink in this painful game of chicken.

    "title": "Different approaches for dispatch",
    "date": "03-08-2018 11:29:00 AM",
    "content": "Frequent readers at WattClarity ® will have noted an increasing number of articles being written under the “Energy Literacy” topic . It’s an increasing focus, in the interests of helping to tame Villain #4 . Today we’ve also posted this linked Beginner’s-Level Guide to how Dispatch Works in the NEM in this category . In developing that post, recognised the need to provide some context – acknowledging that different approaches could be adopted in the dispatch process (and indeed have been over prior decades). (A) “Cost-based Dispatch”, or “Price-based Dispatch” Because of the need to balance supply and demand in real time to keep system frequency stable (at 50Hz in the NEM – see here for an explanation ) there has always existed some form of centralised dispatch across our electricity grid(s) – even prior to the introduction of the National Electricity Market. Even with the (pending) explosion in the rate of adoption of energy storage mechanisms of various forms ( battery storage , pumped storage hydro, or other) there will still remain the need for some form of coordinated control – which, under most future scenarios, will be a role retained by some central organisation. Whilst the need has always been present, what’s changed is just some aspects of how the dispatch process works, starting with a shift from “ cost -based” to “ price -based”: Cost -based dispatch Price -based dispatch Prior to the introduction of the NEM, the Central Dispatcher had visibility of the cost structures of all the significant sources of electricity supply. For instance, in the days of the Queensland Electricity Commission (QEC) all significant generators were owned by the organisation – hence the Central Dispatcher (being the QEC) had full visibility of each generator’s cost structure (particularly its short-run marginal cost), and could dispatch plant taking these into account. Even for a short period after the unbundling of the QEC had commenced (from 1995-1997), a Single Buyer (the QTSC) operated, and could use a cost-based dispatch model as it had full visibility of the costs of supply from the different generators that existed at the time (AUSTA Electric, and some independents, via the commercial contracts for supply). With the introduction of the NEM at the end of 1998 (and with interim markets beforehand) a separation was established between the Central Dispatcher and the individual generation entities established. Under such an arrangement, the Central Dispatcher could not have full visibility of a generator’s cost structure. Rather, a method of price-based dispatch was established. Economic theory describes suppliers making offers* to supply and consumers making bids to consume. The intersection of these offers and bids will generally play a role in setting the price. * Unfortunately to add to general confusion, in the NEM (and in other electricity markets) the term “bid” is used to describe a generator’s offer to supply. The move from cost -based dispatch to price -based dispatch with the advent of the market is sometimes overlooked in discussions about generator bidding: 1) A generators bids in the market do not need to reflect their cost to supply , 2) Costs will play a significant (but not the sole) role in each supplier determining how to bid in a market. 3) So long as there is sufficient competitive tension, market forces will provide an incentive for participants to drive down their costs of operations. That is, for instance, why average wholesale prices in the NEM remained relatively steady for the first 16 years (i.e. declined in inflation-adjusted terms) , up until the effect of the train wreck started to be felt around January 2015. . (B) Different approaches to “Price-based Dispatch” Under a competitive market, there are generally two different types of approaches to how generators might be paid: Option 1 = under a “pay as bid” market , generators offers to supply (if accepted) will be paid only what they bid; whereas Option 2 = under a “marginally priced dispatch” market , generator’s offers to supply (if accepted) will be paid what they bid – and in some cases more, in cases where higher priced bids were the marginal bid. It’s important to understand that, whilst both approaches could work, looking at bid prices offered under one type of dispatch regime and assuming that they would persist under the other is a newbie’s analytical error . The NEM operates with marginal-bid based pricing , so it’s important to recognise the flaws in two common criticisms we’ve seen over the years in relation to dispatch (and pricing) outcomes in the NEM: What’s overlooked What this means Some people overlook that generators are not required , under the rules, to make offers that reflect their costs of operations (though economic theory suggests that there are incentives for them to do so) If this is overlooked, it is easy to attribute blame to generators that are seen to have bids that don’t reflect what people assume their costs are to be. A smaller subset of people understands the complexities of discerning what a generator’s costs actually are, given that must be confidential in a competitive market environment. This AER working paper from June 2018 contains some considerations of these difficulties. Under this economic theory, generators have an incentive to bid based on their short-run marginal cost (i.e. only their variable cost), knowing that contributions to their fixed costs will also occur each time the spot price settles above the price they bid Others might look at a generator being paid above what it bid and infer that this premium to bid price represents an inefficiency or profit (on an implicit assumption that what a generator bids reflects all of its costs, and a return on its investments). . (C) Summing this up Given the above, this means that no-one has full visibility , or knowledge, of all generator’s cost structures (though this does not stop us all guessing at times). This is the case for the AEMO, the AER, Government Departments, competitive generators, consultants, commentators and others (despite how certain they might appear at the time they are making some prognosis or other). This fact is one of the reasons why the ACCC’s findings and conclusions in its July 2018 report “Restoring electricity affordability & Australia’s competitive advantage” are particularly important – because the ACCC is alone in being able to compel participants to reveal their cost structures (a right that the ACCC rightly recognised comes with significant responsibility to ensure that such details are treated confidentially in their reporting). These permutations are illustrated here: Image #1 –Different approaches to dispatch For more of a background to electricity markets in general terms, there are many resources online such as this Wikipedia page .",

In delivering this training, we team up with one of a number of consultants we work closely with (some noted below), as they can help to fill in our gaps in knowledge, and explain things well. With this background, that these new clients can increase the value they gain from their licences to ez2view. The one-on-one training processes are very beneficial, but also time-consuming. Hence we will be augmenting this content with other content posted on WattClarity. Secondary Reason = for other readers ) Whilst the prime focus is for onboarding our new clients (particularly new entrants to the generation sector – some of whom don’t have much background in the way dispatch actually works) it is likely that other readers will also find the content useful. There’s much been said recently about generator bidding in the market- including about a (often very vaguely defined “gaming the market”). This content might help interested stakeholders in that discussion understand some context to better form their own views of what’s happening. With that in mind, we hope you will find the following useful: (A) Different approaches to generator offers (or “bids”) Also today we have posted this explanation of different approaches to dispatch , to provide some context to the marginal price based dispatch approach used in the NEM. (B) A market that is “Energy Only” and a “Gross Pool” At some later point I will explain more about how the NEM is what is described as both “Energy Only” and “Gross Pool”. (C) Beginner Level understanding of the dispatch process In this post we’ll start very simple, and (walking through 5 “dispatch intervals”) will progressively make it slightly more complex. Taken together this post should be viewed as just “Beginner Level” understanding . The more complex parts of the process (and there are many) will be left to subsequent posts, as time permits. In starting here, we make a whole swag of simplifying assumptions – including a number specifically highlighted here for future reference: Unified Dispatch/Trading Interval, lasting an hour Unlike the NEM (which has 5-minute dispatch and 30-minute settlement until 1 st July 2021) we assume that the Dispatch and Trading Interval are the same length. To simplify the maths further, we assume that this interval is a whole hour to avoid distracting confusion about the difference between rates (in MW) and volumes (in MWh) as discussed here . Simplified regions For the first three intervals in this post, we assume a single pricing region and only three generators. Even when we expand this, we keep it to two regions – hence much simpler than the NEM structure. Discrete intervals In the real world, there is overlap between the processes that occur with respect to sequential intervals. In this post we deliberately overlook these. No losses We assume there are no losses in this network. Only one transmission constraint Not until interval 5 do we introduce a measure of congestion, and even then, we keep it simple. No ramp rate consideration We’re assuming infinite ramp rates, and no other constraints on generation output (apart from capacity offered into the market). Single tranches We assume that each generator only bids a single tranche of volume. All Fully Scheduled No consideration is given to the special intricacies of operations of Semi-Scheduled capacity. No (co-optimisation of) Frequency Control In the NEM there are 9 commodity markets, all co-optimised for each dispatch interval. In this very simplified assumption, we deliberately leave out consideration of co-optimisation of the 8 x FCAS commodities . Even with these simplifying assumptions, our experience suggests that the following concepts are not as widely understood as they perhaps should be. We’re interested to hear from our readers about the extent to which the following five intervals helps them? Interval #1 (a Single Region, low demand) Through this animation of Interval #1, we see a situation whereby a single generator is called on to supply all of the demand for that region/market. This generator (being the only one dispatched) is paid what it bid (in $/MWh) to supply the required volume of energy (in MWh) over the interval. Key take-away #1 The Demand Side of this market does not actually bid to consume. Rather, because all of this happens instantaneously, a “single buyer” (in our case the AEMO for the NEM) forecasts the aggregate demand at the end of that interval and uses this to dispatch the supply side at lowest cost. Proceeding into Interval #2 below, we see that the demand has grown such that it exceeds the capacity of the generator that’s bid the lowest price. In this case, the second generator in the bid stack also needs to be called on to dispatch: Interval #2 (a Single Region, moderate demand) Key take-away #2 In this case, it’s important to note that all generators in the region are paid the same marginal price if they are called on to dispatch any of their available capacity during that period. That’s because the market is not “pay as bid” , and so the generators bid lower accordingly. Proceeding onto Interval #3 we assume the demand has grown higher still, requiring all three generators to dispatch: Interval #3 (a Single Region, high demand) Like the two prior intervals, it is the highest-priced bid called on to dispatch that sets the market clearing price, which is paid to all volume dispatched in this market. Moving into Interval #4 we introduce a second region, with an interconnection of limited capacity in between the two regions: Interval #4 (Two Regions, unconstrained flow) We see, in the animation, that (at least in the first instance) the demand for each region is stacked together and the dispatch algorithm solves for the Objective Function of “lowest total cost to supply all of this demand” . In this case, the transfer over the interconnector is 50MW towards the south, which is below the 100MW limit of capacity on the line and so it is said that “the interconnector is unconstrained” or that “the interconnector is not flowing at a limit” . Key take-away #3 It’s important to note that the price paid to generators in the region offering the cheaper generation is higher than would be the case if the interconnection did not exist in this case . In the animation above, this is Region A, which could have supplied its own demand fully with supply from Generator B (at only $15/MWh). Novices sometimes point at instances like these and conclude that the region would be better off without the interconnector. However, this overlooks the many other benefits that are gained from broader interconnection. Moving into the final interval in this post, we see a case whereby the interconnector is “maxed out” and, as a result, prices separate between regions : Interval #5 (Two Regions, constrained flow) For the pedantic and knowledgeable reader here, note that there are some simplifying assumptions made in apportioning the “Demand” column like we have done. We won’t go into this today… In this interval, the dispatch engine would like to dispatch more of the (less expensive) Gen A capacity to meet that last 50MW of demand in region B. However, there’s not enough space in the transmission line to fit the transfer, hence it is noted as being “constrained” or “flowing at a limit”. In our software we adopt two different methods of signifying interconnectors being constrained: NEMwatch™ v10 and deSide® ez2view ™ v7 In these two applications, we colour the interconnection red when the flow is running at a limit: During unconstrained flow, we colour the interconnector black : In our higher end dashboard ez2view, we use colour to denote other things, hence show an interconnection running at a limit by including a “stopper” on the end: Across each of these products, and in others, we also provide visibility of the limits of flow either way on these lines. In the real world these are dynamic, rather than the simple static representations here. Speaking of software for the real world, it’s important to note that the NEM currently has 5 regions (there were 6 regions for a few years after Tasmania joined and up until the abolition of the Snowy Region, hence covered in versions up to and including NEMwatch v7 ). Here’s one snapshot from our popular NEMwatch v10 dashboard that illustrates the 5 regions, and interconnections between each: Note that the prices are not identical between any of the regions , even when the interconnectors are not constrained . In a follow-up post, we’ll drill in further to explain why this is the case. Key take-away #4 When interconnectors are unconstrained, the dispatch process incorporates available supply from all regions and hence, via increased competitive tension, ensures that the price outcomes are as low as possible. When an interconnector is constrained, separate “Economic Islands”* are formed and prices separate . Under this scenario the price in one region will be marginally lower than it would otherwise be – however the price in the other region (i.e. the one unable to access more lower-cost generation) will be substantially higher, sometimes astronomically higher as the cessation of competitive tension enables remaining generator(s) to extract monopoly rent. * Two “Economic Islands” are formed when two groups of regions are economically (though not necessarily physically) separated across a constrained interconnector, meaning that there are different sets of marginal bids in each Economic Island – hence separate prices. We’ve been using the term “Economic Island” since 2006 on WattClarity and specifically include special recognition in NEM-Watch v10 of them because of their significance in terms of the separation of prices between regions (and local generator market power). We hope that it is obvious that, with the NEM being 5 regions interconnected together, the dispatch process is more complicated than our simplified 2-region model illustrated in the fictitious intervals above. (D) Progressing beyond Beginner Level As time permits, we will be seeking to expand on these explainers under the Energy Literacy section of WattClarity – to augment the one-on-one training provided to our the new entrant generators coming onboard with ez2view, and more generally as an attempt to help tame Villain #4 . PS on 28th February 2019 As part of the process of preparing our Generator Report Card 2018 for publication, we invested considerable time in analysis of AEMO’s Price Setter data. In conjunction with this, we posted this (preliminary) Intermediate Guide to follow on from this Beginner’s Guide. We trust you will find this of some use. However please note that WattClarity® is our “spare time” job, and that animations like the above take a fair bit of time and effort to put together. Hence, we ask for your patience whilst waiting for subsequent efforts. (E) For one-on-one assistance If you need one-on-one assistance in understanding more about the NEM, we would highly recommend either of the following two people. We utilise their services heavily, and are sure you will gain great value from them (though note that any stupid mistakes in the preparing the above Beginner’s Guide are entirely mine ) . Allan O’Neil Jonathon Dyson Allan has been a guest author on WattClarity for several years now. His detailed analysis of some particularly volatile periods has been of great value to our readers (as many have noted to me). In parallel with this work, Allan has been involved with us in helping to deliver training to new clients coming onboard with ez2view – and has assisted us internally on other projects. Allan has also begun providing an on-site educational service covering how spot prices are set in the NEM, and other important aspects of the physical electricity market. Further details about “NEM Powered Training” are here . Jonathon has also been a guest author on WattClarity , though a more sporadic one. We have utilised Jonathon’s services in several ways over many years. Jon has also been involved with us in helping to deliver training to new clients coming onboard with ez2view. Further details about how Greenview Strategic Consulting can assist you in learning more about the NEM are here . Similarly, if you know of other specific people who are excellent at both understanding the nuances of the dispatch process and explaining these to others, could you please point them our way? Until next time, I hope this has helped?",

    "title": "Helping to tame Villain #4 by understanding more about MLFs",
    "date": "27-07-2018 11:34:00 AM",
    "content": "On Friday 20th July I named the growing deficit in required “Energy Literacy” as Villain #4 in our evolving energy sector train wreck. My sense is that we’re all contributing to the deficit in our own ways – for instance: those of us who have operated in the energy sector the way it used to be are sometimes slow to learn of the rapid emergence of alternative technologies, and/or the steep progression down the cost curve for some of these; whereas we’ve seen evidence that suggests some new entrants are blissfully unaware of some of the complexities of operating generation plant in the NEM (sometimes even blaming it on some grand conspiracy when reality comes home to roost). My post about Villain #4 triggered conversations with a range of people – some of them being about the large element of surprise that seemed to greet some large changes in Marginal Loss Factors (MLFs) for generation plant in some locations. Like me, a number of people I spoke with were shocked that this seemed to blindside some new entrants. (A) Marginal Loss Factors have varied over time, and will do so in future In conversations about northern Queensland (an area that has probably only just seen the start of major changes to Marginal Loss Factors, and also transmission congestion as well), we wondered why these new entrants had not used the twenty-year history of MLFs in the NEM as a guide to understanding the variability that might emerge over the coming 20 years. During one conversation about northern Queensland over coffee during the week, we spoke about the location of Collinsville given its special history – it had formerly hosted a coal-fired power station (since retired), and will shortly feature a couple new solar farms in the vicinity. The conversation prompted me to crunch a few numbers and put together the following trend showing monthly and financial year data for northern Queensland featuring Collinsville: Now the loss factor (in black) for the connection point for the old Collinsville Power station ceased being published by AEMO when the station was retired. However I’ve also included (in red) the loss factor for the nearby load connection point which (whilst not identical, because of its own local issues) is directionally consistent with the black line. Question 1) In our conversation earlier this week, we mused why developers had not taken the step of perusing the 20-year history of marginal loss factors at locations like these to ascertain that there has already been a fair variability in MLF over that history – hence it should be expected there would be variability in future. Question 2) Coupled with this, the large influx of new generation sources into northern Queensland from many solar and some wind generators could well mean a significant surplus of generation in the area, leading to a significant “penalty” to all generators in the area due to long electrical distance to the Regional Reference Node. In the chart above I have assembled monthly aggregate production from generators for which AEMO has data, and compared it to (approximate) aggregate consumption in the same area using our historical record of the Powerlink Qdata set available as an optional extra with ez2view . In a very rough projection out 18-24 months into the future, we see that the aggregate supply increasing significantly, with not much change in consumption patterns. This should flag the risk of a big drop in MLF for generators in the zone. We’re working to make this history of MLFs more easily accessible to our clients – for instance, it’s being introduced as another set of data series into NEMreview v7 , and also via the Trend Engine into ez2view (please call us on +61 7 3368 4064 if you want to speak with us about this process, referencing our internal job number TFS-10282) . It’s currently queued up behind a couple of higher priority jobs. (B) How are they calculated? You can find more of the gory details about Marginal Loss Factors in the documentation linked to this page on the AEMO website . I just want to flag a few big factors: They are forward looking Loss factors for each financial year are calculated and published by AEMO a couple months prior to the start of the financial year. They are sometimes updated during the year in the light of new data, or occasionally for corrections. They are based on the expectation of what will happen in the year ahead, in terms of demand and dispatch patterns, and hence network flows and losses. Given that they are forward-looking, this naturally means that they will involve projections (complete with all the challenges that this entails ). This means that there is not a perfect match between loss factors in the chart above and what actually happened in a given financial year, for instance. They are Marginal At all times of each day, in an electricity supply system there is electrical energy “lost” (i.e. converted to heat) in the delivery process. These losses vary as a function of energy injections, energy withdrawals, and the topology of flows. In line with the fact that the pricing is set based on the marginal unit of energy (reference coming), losses are also attributed to connection points based on marginal units of energy. They are calculated with respect to a Regional Reference Node (RRN) Each region has its own Regional Reference Node (which is generally some substation in the capital city* representing, electrically, the center of that network). In simple terms, the closer you can be (electrically) to that Regional Reference Node, the lower your Marginal Losses. * Tasmania’s RRN is in the north of the state, not in Hobart, because that’s where the center of the network is They are periodically adjusted , but not dynamic For all connection points within a region (i.e. for all generators, and all bulk supply points) a loss factor is fixed for a given financial year – but adjusted from one financial year to the next. This approach was a compromise made in the market design process (>20 years ago) – between: “postage stamp pricing”, which is very easy to understand, but ignores all losses; and Fully dynamic nodal pricing, which would be more mathematically pure, but even harder for participants and others to understand than the current approach. Loss factors are set around unity The MLF at the Regional Reference Node is (by definition) 1.0 The higher the marginal losses required to supply to/from the RRN from a generator/load, the further away from 1.0 is that loss factor. These loss factors do vary significantly from location to location , because the network supporting the NEM is “long and skinny” and our population is sparse. They also vary considerably from year to year , because large changes in the supply/demand balance locally (in relative terms) have a significant effect on losses. They are supposed to provide a locational signal For instance, historically Central Queensland has had a surplus of local supply (i.e. from Stanwell, Gladstone and Callide) compared with local demand (Rockhampton, Gladstone and the CQ mining regions). For this reason, the generators have been “penalized” with a loss factor below 1.0 In the same way, historically there has been a deficit of generation in Northern Queensland (mainly peaking plant) relative to demand (Cairns, Townsville, Mackay and associated mining loads). For this reason, energy users have been “penalized” with a loss factor above 1.0 However, it is important to remember that these loss factors are a function of both: The local supply/demand balance; and Electrical distance from the RRN. Hence, in simple terms, if there is a local surplus of supply over demand, and the location is a long way from the RRN, a developer should expect a hefty penalty in the form of the MLF. Please refer to the AEMO documentation for more detail. In particular on that page, refer to this link to the AEMO document “Treatment of Loss Factors in the NEM” form July 2012 (flagged as a particularly good reference by one of our early readers). Thanks! (C) Who wears the risk? With the near certainty that MLFs will vary considerably over the life of a new entrant generator locating in northern Queensland (or any location that has a relatively small local demand, and is a long way from the RRN), it should be clear that there is a significant risk to the generation deemed to be generated by the plant, which flows through to revenue (and also, I believe, to the registration of LGCs). Hence all parties related to such a new entrant generator need to be conscious of this, and be “eyes wide open” in terms of who wears the risk: 1) If you are the project proponent and are able to get off-takers who agree to take delivery “at the station gate”, then you have successfully transferred that risk* over to the off-taker but at what cost? I mean this both in terms of the price you might have had to agree with to get the other party to wear a risk they can do even less than you to control, and also in terms of the chance that you have found an off-taker that was not aware of the risk, and have burnt them (and perhaps your reputation) in the process. This second consideration will perhaps more come to the fore as the influx of corporates seeking renewables-backed PPAs ramps up (e.g. the session yesterday I attended with nearly 100 attendees), where the other party might not be as fully aware of these sorts of risks. 2) If you are the project proponent that has some form of off-take arrangement at the RRN (more common, I would think), or have merchant exposure, you are still wearing the risk . What can you do to manage this? * note that, even if you (as a project proponent) have transferred the risk relating to MLFs , you will probably not have been able to transfer the (separate) risk of congestion (felt increasingly by semi-scheduled plant in South Australia, and likely in northern Queensland and other parts in years to come) and also risks relating to negative prices (with perhaps the risk increasing due to the emerging “solar correlation penalty” ). They are food for future posts.",

    "title": "How do New Entrant Retailers manage wholesale market risk?",
    "date": "24-07-2018 01:46:00 PM",
    "content": "The Final Report of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Pricing Inquiry presents evidence that smaller retailers and new entrants are disadvantaged when it comes to managing wholesale price and volume volatility. Two areas of disadvantage were highlighted: 1) market access and 2) market illiquidity. In the first case, inevitably small trade sizes, credit risk, and the high transaction costs of negotiating complex hedges (e.g. a mix of caps and swaps) are a barrier. In the second case, the ACCC contends, vertical integration of large retailers decreases overall market activity for that business and reduces contracting options for smaller retailers. [1] The below figure from the ACCC Report gives a snapshot of cap activity, note the extremely low trading volumes in South Australia (and the barrier this presents for new entrants). The ACCC’s investigations looked at a range of wholesale risk management practices employed by retailers including minimal hedging, load-following hedges, portfolios of contracts and vertical integration. Over the past year, Compliance Quarter has worked with the majority of new entrant retailers in National Electricity Market (NEM) jurisdictions. Drawing on our experience, I ask, what hedging practices are we seeing? And what implications do these practices have for the retailer, the end-customer and the broader market? (1) Related entity hedging One way of lowering the barrier to hedging contract markets is to leverage the expertise and capital of a related entity within a broader corporate group or commercial arrangement. I have seen several new entrants partner with specialist businesses that hold or manage a financial services licence and look after hedging arrangements. While this is, perhaps, a solution for established businesses/business groups seeking to enter the retail space, this won’t work for new entrants starting ‘from the ground up’. Furthermore, it does nothing to alleviate contract market illiquidity/ the cost of hedge contracting in the first place. In the end, the premium paid for hedging products passes through to the customer. (2) The rise of the ‘on-selling’ retailer There is another option for new retailers; forgo wholesale market exposure altogether. Let me explain. Private electricity (‘embedded’) networks are on the rise in Australia. While precise numbers are unknown, the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) estimates there are currently 3-4000 in the NEM. [2] In many cases, the owner/operator of the embedded network ‘on-sells’ energy bought from a market retailer at the ‘gate meter’ through a retail exemption. However, as the size and number of embedded networks grow, a rising number of these on-sellers are becoming authorised retailers. Furthermore, with recent ‘power of choice’ reforms giving all embedded network customers the right to go ‘on market’, these on-selling retailers directly compete with market retailers. With no direct wholesale market risk, do on-selling retailers have an unfair competitive advantage over market retailers? Not necessarily. The on-selling retailers end up taking on a ‘residual’ wholesale market risk. As market retailers pass on hedging costs to their customers, the on-selling retailer ends up paying through its retail contracts at gate meters. Larger on-selling retailers will often need to negotiate (and re-negotiate) multiple retail contracts at gate meters with multiple retailers, and pay the premium dictated. If dealing with non-vertically integrated market retailers, unfairness or inefficiency in the hedge contracting market is still being passed on to the on-selling retailer and the eventual customer. (3) The rise of embedded generation In the previous two strategies, any general inefficiencies or unfairness in the hedging contract markets may be passed on to the end-customer. One way I have seen new entrants, both market and on-selling, alleviate even residual wholesale market risk is through distributed or ‘embedded’ generation. [3] . This involves retailers installing generation, often solar photovoltaic, and then supplying/selling the energy to their customers. In some cases, the generation is ‘behind the meter’, supplied directly to customers through private infrastructure; in other cases, the energy is fed back into the NEM and sold through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). In either situation, the embedded generation constitutes a partial hedge for the retailer through the ‘fixed’ price they receive for that generation. In essence, it’s vertical integration for the small players. While embedded generation can help effectively manage wholesale market risk, it has been argued that it presents broader risks to the NEM. One of the key motivations for the National Energy Guarantee (NEG) is the risk that newer renewable generation poses for system reliability. Solar and wind cannot easily be ‘dispatched’ to meet surges in demand. As most embedded generation is currently non-dispatchable its growth must be managed alongside other ‘balancing’ initiatives including battery technology and demand response. Overall, it is clear that new entrants are employing a range of strategies to compete with the big players, many of which mitigate disadvantages in the hedging contract markets. It remains to be seen whether regulation of the hedge contracting market in the NEG (likely to happen), or the ACCC Review (may happen), will make an easier path for new competitors. [1] See ACCC’s Retail Electricity Pricing Inquiry—Final Report (June 2018) , pp104-134. [2] See AEMC’s Final Report: Review of Regulatory Arrangements for Embedded Networks (November 2017) , p15.

    "title": "Villain #4 – the yawning gap between our Sector-Wide Aggregate “Energy Literacy” and what we require",
    "date": "20-07-2018 09:49:00 AM",
    "content": "It was almost exactly a year ago when I spoke at Clean Energy Summit 2017 and provided a forecast of sorts (for train wreck underway) . This means that Clean Energy Summit 2018 is just around the corner, and I am looking forward to using this opportunity to resume some conversations, and learn from other perspectives about this multi-faceted energy transition . During my talk last year, I undertook to post more about the “villains” I saw who/which have been acting to create and propagate the train wreck which is still very much a real risk. Over the 12 months since the conference I have only managed to post about the first three villains: Villain #1) First and foremost are our emperors , who are repeatedly revealing that they have no clothes – Villain #2) However we, the voting public are complicit in this tragedy . Villain #3) This happening, at least in part, because of a very vocal rump at either extreme of the Emotion-o-meter who are each presenting the transition as a black-or-white issue. … and so this bring me to Villain #4, which is what I see as a growing deficit in sector-wide aggregate “Energy Literacy ” required to deal with the manifold & complex challenges in this energy transition. (A) Evidence of this gap We are well aware that a “sector-wide aggregate level of Energy Literacy” is not a metric that can be accurately measured, or trended over time (rather, it’s a term that I’ve conjured up to explain this concern) . Whilst it can’t be measured, we certainly can see instances where the gap has been evident. As just one example of this, earlier this week I noted the start of a conversation on LinkedIn about some useful content developed by the AEMO in their Integrated System Plan 2018 to help prospective developers understand that Marginal Loss Factors (MLFs) are a material determinant of the long-term returns they might earn on potential generation developments in different parts of the NEM: In my comment I noted I was “amazed” – however “gobsmacked” would be a more literal interpretation of my response when I’ve read elsewhere of the responses of some new entrants to the generation game express complete surprise at being slapped with large changes in MLFs after competition had loaded into the same locations as them (i.e. remote/weak parts of the network, a long way from the bulk of the customers). As if it were some form of grand conspiracy, rather than just a reflection of physics at work. See some of the comments/quotes expressing surprise in this article on 1st May in RenewEconomy (there was plenty of the same that flowed onto LinkedIn and Twitter at the time). We subsequently posted more discussion about Marginal Loss Factors here on 27th July . I feel a similar response to hearing of surprise when new entrants experience their output being constrained down , and not knowing why: More surprised comments quoted in RenewEconomy on 7th May , With some more background to the types of constraints in prior WattClarity articles here . More to come later, to discuss more about the effect of congestion on new entrants. Also some surprise expressed by some at being hit by a “ solar correlation penalty ” or its cousin, the “wind correlation penalty” , like it was not inevitable (though I did note here that I was surprised at how quickly its arrived in Queensland during low demand seasons). It seems clear to me that there will be some people take a big haircut on their investments – fundamentally (and sadly) because there was too great a gap in required “Energy Literacy” . Given so much of our future will depend on a number of these new entrants, with the new projects and innovations they bring, it’s worth thinking through how this particular part of the gap has evolved and what can the energy sector can do to rapidly close that gap (involving the developers themselves, but also the consultants that serve them and the financiers that invest in their projects). . (B) Several factors contributing to growing the gap We wonder if there are not several reasons why this gap is growing, including these three: Factor #1) The space has become another step-change more complex Back (a couple decades ago) when my involvement started in the energy sector , it was a more stable place – where heuristics developed over prior decades of industry experience could provide good “rules of thumb” that would get you through most challenges. Through the 1990’s we started developing the competitive market structure and disaggregated the QEC, SECV and ECNSW into many smaller organisations and we had our first step change in complexity. From a small room of people in each state (the Dilbert types) who guarded the precious secrets of how dispatch worked in a grid using cost-based dispatch, we moved to an environment with 40 or so organisations with trading desks, each staffed with their own people who needed to know the same thing – but overlaid with considerations of competitor behaviour in a market environment as well (i.e. moving from cost-based dispatch to price-based dispatch). This was a significant step change in complexity, and also coincided with when our organisation came into being. As noted in Sept 2017, the wholesale** market served us pretty well over almost 2 decades since NEM start – providing some illustration of how we collectively navigated the increased complexity that came out of the commencement of the NEM. ** Note this is not saying anything about the challenges in the retail sector, or in network land.. That same article also highlighted the recent sharp price escalation that is symptomatic of the train-wreck we’ve brought on ourselves , at least in part because we’ve missed the need to skill up for the next step change in complexity that’s already upon us: Used to be In the past, we operated in an environment whereby there was essentially just one non-controllable variable (i.e. electricity demand) with controllable/dispatchable supply sources dispatched to meet expected demand levels. Fairly simple, compared to how it now is … Now is We’re already in an environment where we have thrown in at least 5 other independent variables : 1) We have sunshine and cloud cover, and how this affects solar PV (somewhat inversely aligned with demand during summer, but not so during winter); 2) We have wind patterns of a very different cycle, and with higher degrees of correlation than I’d been led to believe by some of the motivational pitches by wind advocates; 3) We have drought/flood patterns that will affect hydro catchment areas (already 2 significant events in NEM history), and will do more in future. 4) We’ve now tightly linked our electricity market to the international market for LNG and oil; and 5) Perhaps most complex of all, our energy sector has become inextricably intertwined in both global science and global political sentiment ( both of which are important) relating to concerns about climate change. Could well be in future In the future, it looks pretty certain that we will need to almost come full circle and end up controlling large swathes of demand (either directly via demand response , or through storage) in order to deal with a majority of uncontrollable supply sources. The AEMO sums up this step change in complexity in their Integrated System Plan 2018 as follows: “In the current period, the changes are far more comprehensive and fundamental. The industry is now experiencing the simultaneous effects and benefits of digitalisation, ageing infrastructure, a markedly and rapidly changing cost structure in both supply and storage, flattened and even negative demand growth, the impacts of climate change, cyber security concerns, and a profound change in consumer preferences and expectations for the industry. ” We, as an industry, knew such challenges were coming down the pipe and yet (like a deer in the headlights) have not done enough to prepare ourselves for it. However the challenges don’t end there… Factor #2) There’s an increasing number of people clamouring to have their say Layered on top of the step change in challenges facing the energy sector, there has also been a rapid escalation in the number of voices trying to be heard with respect to this energy transition. Both the volume, and the splintering, of the conversation has come about in part because of the advent of social media (of which WattClarity is one example, of course). Whilst social media has been an enabler , the fundamental driver has been the sharp uptake in business and community interest in the energy sector. Interest has risen for several reasons – including 3 big ones: 1) Primarily because of the sharp escalation in energy costs for most; whilst also 2) Accentuated by concerns about climate change by many; and 3) Not to mention naked political motivation for a smaller number (especially the vocal operators at either extreme of the Emotion-o-meter ). All this has led to a much greater volume of “discussion” occurring (though in some quarters labelling it “discussion” is a perhaps too kind). Hence with increased interest in the energy transition, and escalation of volume and spread of the discussion, how would a genuinely interested and objective bystander see the woods for the trees? I recall that the QEC (decades ago) had some “lucky” engineers periodically assigned to review, and sometimes reply to, letters from earnest contributors who’d write in with some proposal or other about production of energy through their version of a perpetual motion machine. That element of society has not gone away – just shifted online (where everyone can be a dog). Just because some statement about the energy transition attracts a number of “likes”, this does not make it factual, or worthwhile. It just means that it’s popular in a particular crowd: 1) but might be an example of the blind leading the blind 2) with the unfortunate addition being that most of our political class fall into that “blind” category. Factor #3) The passage of time, and pace of change, is presenting a risk of loss of industry memory It’s almost exactly twenty years since the NEM commenced – with the NEM following on the prior state-based market (VicPool started 1994 from memory). The passage of time is naturally meaning that some of the people who assisted with that step change increase in complexity are no longer around to assist us with this next step change. This natural attrition is being compounded by the rapid pace of change in the sector, as a result of which the employee churn rate is higher than would otherwise be the case. Organisations, particularly the large ones, also have their own flavours of this churn challenge (e.g. because of internal cultural dynamics in an uncertain/challenged external environment) that is requiring attention to manage – too low and capacity grows scale, too high and organisational capacity walks out the door. This is the case for wholesale participants (e.g. on trading desks), and for our key institutions, along with the large services sector supporting those operational organisations as well. . (C) Some steps we’re taking to help As a company, we’ve been operating since 2000 – and have been consistently focused on making complexity understandable . As such, striving to offset Villain #4 is a core part of what we do. We do this through a variety of licensed software applications for our clients – and we’re also pleased to be able to provide a range of services that are free to access more broadly: WattClarity ® Hard for us to believe that WattClarity has been running for more than 10 years! We appreciate the feedback we receive from readers who appreciate the service (and also from those who admonish us to do better in future). As a result of identifying Villain #4, more recently we have been including a number of educational articles under an “Energy Literacy” banner . This is something we’ll be seeking to extend in future. Widgets that are free to access We also appreciate the opportunity to work with a range of different sponsors to help increase the level of awareness and understanding in several different areas of this energy transition with a range of widgets available, particularly these four: 1) Since it was first launched in 2015, we have been pleased to work with RenewEconomy to help broaden understanding of the current mix of fuel types coming together to meet electricity demand through the NEMwatch Widget . This was upgraded late 2017 in response to the introduction of the Hornsdale Power Reserve 2) We also worked with Energy Consumers Australia to launch a different NEMwatch Widget that helps users to understand the link between electricity demand and the underlying weather patterns across Australia. 3) We’ve also worked with the Smart Energy Council to provide our Battery Finder Widget , to help people access data on makes and models of battery storage systems available for use in Australia. 4) Currently we’re working with our ez2view clients to help them create, publish and embed their own live updating widgets focused on parts of the energy market particularly of interest to them (the trend widget here showing the live output of the Hornsdale battery is one example of this).Others are in process… We’re very aware that we’re making this journey up the learning curve along with everyone else – i.e. we are part of the problem (as well as, we hope, part of the solution as well). We are reminded almost every week that there is a large volume of knowledge we should possess, but don’t. Behind the curtain we’re pedalling like crazy in order to bridge our own capability gap as fast as we can, though the complexity in the energy sector continues to grow. In our own internal efforts, we’re pleased to be able to work closely with a number of external service providers who can work with us to stretch our own capability (which sometimes amounts to us all sitting down to puzzle through something we all don’t understand – like, for instance, certain outcomes in particular dispatch intervals). If you know of others who could also work with us to build our own capability , we would ask you to point them in our direction, please. We really want (need!) their help. I’m not speaking at Clean Energy Summit this year , however will look forward to attending and might see you there. To those clients who are our first “Quarterly Highlights” session on Monday 30th July in Sydney , we’ll look forward to discussing more of what we’re doing.",

    "content": "This is a back-dated article – posted as something that will be referenced in future. On 17th July 2018 (as noted in this Media Release at the time ), the AEMO released its first Integrated System Plan for the National Electricity Market. (A) Triggered by the Finkel Review The ISP built on the work of AEMO’s 2018 National Transmission Network Development Plan (NTNDP) – but went beyond that, in response to the Finkel Review (specifically pertaining to the need for a strategic national plan ). The Finkel Review noted (p3): “We observed that every country or jurisdiction has a unique electricity system. The one thing most have in common is a strategic plan to preserve energy security and affordability while transitioning to a lower emissions future. In Australia, we held public and private consultations in every region of the National Electricity Market. We received 390 written submissions. Our consultations included large industrial users such as copper mines, small businesses such as meatworks, consumer and business representatives, market participants, regulators, government departments and your Energy Ministers. The overwhelming message was the call for Australia to adopt a single, nationally agreed plan to manage the transition to a lower emissions economy. Stakeholders argued that business as usual is not an option. Policy reversals and piecemeal government interventions undermine investor confidence” The Finkel Review also noted (p124) that: “Stakeholders have identified a range of whole-of-system benefits that can be realised through greater strategic planning of transmission infrastructure including: • Creating more options for reliability through the development of a diverse mix of large-scale generation capacity in a range of locations through the grid, including the development of new renewable energy zones. • By enabling the connection of large-scale renewables and large-scale backup generation and storage, such as gas, grid-scale batteries and pumped hydro, the transmission system can be a critical enabler of significant emissions reductions. • Ensuring the transmission system is able to contribute to the preservation of network security and stability, including through inter-regional provision of security services. • Ensuring reactive power control, and in future by procuring necessary inertia and fast frequency response. • Increasing affordability by ensuring consumers are able to access the benefits of a competitive wholesale market ” (B) Where to download the 2018 ISP The 2018 ISP consisted of two main PDF documents – a 100-page main report , and 112-pages of Appendices : 100-page main report 112-page appendix Here’s the main report: Here are appendices: Further information about the 2018 ISP is currently here on the AEMO website (including the link to this Interactive Map ).

    "title": "High SA Prices on Monday 9 July–Business as Usual?",
    "date": "11-07-2018 03:40:00 PM",
    "content": "Paul’s on-the-day post gave a wide-ranging overview of the multiple factors involved in Monday’s 5-digit dispatch prices in South Australia. To summarise very briefly, these were: low wind, with very little output from SA’s 1,500 MW-plus of installed windfarm capacity restrictions on the primary interconnection with Victoria (Heywood) which actually forced flows out of SA despite the high prices reduced small-scale solar output (showing up as increased scheduled demand), due to cloud cover gas prices (although in the context of recent winters these were not remarkably high) reduced availability at Pelican Point relatively low output levels from SA’s largest gas-fired station, Torrens Island, despite having six out of eight units online and generating throughout the day In this followup I’ll focus on some things Paul didn’t have data or time available to investigate further, including: the physical supply-demand balance the detailed reasons for and impact of the constraints on the Heywood interconnection bidding behaviour of the key thermal generators the patterning of prices within half hourly settlement intervals, highlighting the “5/30” effect we’ve previously commented on here what ended the period of volatility? I’ll be making extensive use of market data views available from ez2view and in particular its time-travel capability, enabling drilldown into data and conditions as they appeared at various times throughout the day. All times referenced are NEM time, unless otherwise noted. Physical Supply-Demand Balance The first thing to point out is that despite the low wind, reduced capacity at Pelican Point, and absence of imports, the supply-demand balance in South Australia was never an issue. Throughout the period of price volatility, at least 1,000 MW of undispatched capacity remained available against a demand level of only 1,500 – 1,700 MW. The chart below shows actual and forecast outcomes as at 14:30, after the main period of price volatility had ended: SA Price, Available Generation & Demand Outcomes 9 July 2018 (as at 2:30PM) While some of the available generation shown represented “fast start” generating units not actually running, much of it was available at online generating units which were dispatched to well below their maximum output levels purely because of the way they had been bid into the market – more on this below. Heywood Restrictions The underlying cause of restricted import capability was an outage of a 275kV transmission line forming part of the connection between Victoria and South Australia via Heywood, outlined in an AEMO market notice from nearly four weeks earlier: AEMO Market Notice – SA Transmission Outage Interestingly, the transmission line in question is nowhere near the border between South Australia and Victoria, highlighting that “an interconnector” is not a single transmission line connecting two states, but an elongated flow path which may comprise many different lines and pieces of equipment, all of which contribute to the ability to carry power between regions: South Australian Transmission Network Diagram (Source: ElectraNet 2018 Annual Planning Report) Now, one might expect that with one of two lines on this flow path out of action, ability to import power might be reduced – perhaps by 50% – rather than completely lost; however a key constraint applied by AEMO during the outage actually implies that system security would be at risk, in the event of the parallel 275kV line suddenly tripping, unless total northward power flows from the south-east of South Australia (including flows from Victoria) are held at less than about 30-40 MW. The details of this constraint (like most constraints) are eye-wateringly complex: Constraint Restricting Vic to SA Flows – but a key detail is that it is a transient stability constraint, which means it protects the system and its components against sudden instability in the event of the second 275kV line tripping. In other words, the risk addressed by this constraint is not necessarily inability of generation in South Australia, or under-frequency load shedding, to arrest the supply-demand imbalance within a few seconds if flows on the tripped line had been significant, but much shorter-term electrical phenomena arising from a trip, which could put system stability at risk. In effect, this constraint reflects an internal transmission limitation within South Australia requiring generation & load in the south-east corner, as well as flows from or to Victoria, to be essentially separated from the rest of the state. So if generation in the south-east corner – the Snuggery and Ladbroke gas turbines, and Lake Bonney and Canunda windfarms – exceeds local load plus a small net transfer northward, the balance of that generation has to flow eastwards to Victoria. When SA prices exceeded those in Victoria, any such eastward flows were in the opposite direction to what would prima-facie be expected given the price differential – transfers would normally be from the NEM region with lower prices to the higher price region. The effect of internal transmission constraints like this one can be to force output from generation on the “wrong” side of the constraint (but still receiving the high regional spot price) to flow into a lower price neighbouring region. This reflects a compromise adopted in the design of the NEM between a more economically pure “nodal pricing” market, and one with fixed regional boundaries within which uniform regional spot prices apply. Also in operation throughout the transmission outage was a similar constraint effectively limiting southward flows across the single 275kV line to Tailem Bend and maximum exports to Victoria. In the event, this constraint did not bind because AEMO “clamped” flows to Victoria at even lower levels to limit the buildup of negative “settlement residues” arising from expensive SA power being exported to lower-priced Victoria. Bidding Behaviour & Price Outcomes With imports from Victoria not available and minimal wind generation, the bidding behaviour of South Australian thermal generation became crucial in setting spot prices. I noted above that there remained around 1,000 MW of undispatched spare capacity throughout the period of price volatility, meaning that the high prices reflected the way generation had been offered into the market rather than tight physical supply-demand balance. We can start by looking at how the thermal generators in SA had set up their bids at the start of the day (bid days run from 4am to 4am): SA Thermal Generators’ Aggregate Bids as at 4:05am 9 July 2018 Immediately obvious is the reduction in capacity offered below $150/MWh from the half hour trading interval 8:30-9:00am, due to coincide with the start time of the interconnector outage (note: while the physical outage was due to start at 9:30 am, AEMO commences applying special “ramping” constraints to interconnector flows one hour beforehand to progressively reflect the constraint ultimately applying). Nearly all of this reduction in “cheap” spare capacity reflected the start of day bid setup at AGL’s Torrens Island power station, shown in the next chart: AGL Torrens Island Power Station Bids into the future , as at 4:05am 9 July The key thing about this bid setup is the clear expectation of changed market conditions, and very likely a willingness to see or even promote spot price volatility, associated with commencement of the transmission outage at 8:30 AM. The overall impact of these bids, low wind, and import restrictions was clearly signalled in the outlook for prices in on the day predispatch runs, for example the 4am run: Predispatch Price Forecast for SA as at 4:05am 9 July 2018 Spot prices outcomes, while very volatile, were obviously less extreme than the fifteen hours near the Market Price Cap shown in the predispatch forecast above – the chart below shows 5 minute dispatch prices (red) and 30 minute averaged settlement prices (black) between 8am and 4pm, highlighting the half hour trading interval boundaries (the labels refer to the end time of each trading interval): SA Dispatch and Trading Interval Prices 9 July 2018 8:00AM – 4:00PM (Source: AEMO Market Data) What shows up clearly here is the concentration of extreme dispatch prices in the first few 5 minute intervals of the half hours from 10:00-10:30 to 14:00-14:30, with dispatch prices then typically falling across the remainder of each half hour to as low as –$1,000/MWh in the last few 5 minute dispatch periods. This price patterning was driven predominantly by dynamic rebidding from the many fast start peaking generators in South Australia (a mix of open cycle gas turbines and liquid fuelled plants, owned by a variety of market participants). At the start of the day, a substantial portion of capacity on these units was offered at very high prices: SA Peaking Generators’ Aggregate Bids as at 4:05am 9 July 2018 (‘Peaking Generators’ here comprise Hallett, Dry Creek, Mintaro, Quarantine, Port Lincoln, Angaston, Lonsdale & Port Stanvac) Having a large majority of their capacity offered at very high prices like this is not an unusual bid setup for fast-start generators in the NEM. With high short run marginal costs (typically several hundred $/MWh) and substantial costs of startup, such plants often “park” their capacity in very high price bid bands so that they will not be called on to start by AEMO for single dispatch intervals at moderate spot prices which would not be economic. If high spot prices do eventuate, plant owners may then choose to rebid capacity into lower price bands in order to run. Across a day like Monday, several hundred rebids across dozens of fast start units were made in response to the high dispatch prices, so that by the end of the bid day, the final bids made by these generators looked very different: SA Peaking Generators’ Aggregate Bids for 9 July as at 4:00am 10 July 2018 As the day progressed, the peaking generators offered far more capacity into “must-run” price bands (as low as –$1,000/MWh), and highlighted in the red area above we can see a pattern of volumes in this price range being pushed up even further when a 5 minute dispatch price spike occurred early in a half hour trading interval. This “crowding in” of offers is what led to 5-minute South Australian dispatch prices falling to as low as –$1,000/MWh at the end of many of these half hours. To get a further sense of how dynamic this rebidding was, we can look at the bids as they appeared at midday, halfway through the period of price volatility: SA Peaking Generators’ Aggregate Bids for 9 July as at 12:00pm As many commentators have pointed out, this form of rebidding is a predictable artefact of the disparity between 5 minute dispatch pricing and 30 minute settlement pricing in the NEM . A single dispatch price close to the Market Cap at the start of a 30 minute trading interval can essentially guarantee a very high (> ~$2,000/MWh) 30 minute settlement price for any energy generated within the half hour, so fast start generators with short enough startup times can rebid immediately they see a price spike, and once started run for the balance of the half hour to capitalise on the high settlement price. Obviously slow-start generators already online with capacity offered at high prices can also rebid some or all of this capacity down to low prices to seek higher dispatch volumes – for example AGL’s Torrens Island: AGL Torrens Island Power Station Bids for 9 July as at 12:00pm The change from 30 minute settlement to 5 minute settlement recently ruled by the Australian Energy Market Commission and scheduled for commencement in 2021/22 will require a quite different approach to bidding and operation of fast start peaking generation and may well challenge the economics of some existing peakers. A couple of other impacts of these “5/30”-driven price outcomes are worth a quick comment: increases in SA generation offered at low prices towards the end of relevant half hours would tend to force increased energy flows from SA to Victoria, but on a half hourly settlement basis, SA prices were much higher than those in Victoria, so net eastward flows are financially negative. These counter-price flows caused AEMO to “clamp” export levels on the Heywood interconnector to levels no higher than required by the transient stability constraint discussed earlier; despite the gyrations in 5 minute dispatch prices between $14,000/MWh and –$1,000/MWh, it was not possible for the Hornsdale Power Reserve (Neoen-Tesla battery) to arbitrage these price differences, since like any other market participant it pays and receives the half hourly settlement price for energy stored or discharged, not the 5 minute dispatch price. Comment from Tesla Energy on 5-minute Settlement (from LinkedIn) Pelican Point Availability Increase So what caused the price volatility to subside earlier than predicted in the start of day predispatch outlook? The answer was Pelican Point being able to increase its availability on the day, as shown by the difference between its start of day and final bids: Engie Pelican Point Power Station Bids looking forward for the day 9 July 2018 as at 4:05AM Engie Pelican Point Power Station Bids for 9 July 2018 as at 4:00AM 10 July The key rebid increasing available capacity from 260 MW to nearly 500 MW (startup of the station’s second gas turbine unit) was made just after 2:00 PM. Runup of the turbine began just after 3:00 PM, following which price volatility subsided relatively quickly. Final Thoughts Like many aspects of the NEM, the details underlying Monday’s price behaviour in South Australia are highly complex. But the major underlying driver of this event is a simple one – limited competition . With over 2,000 MW of potential competition for dispatch from Victorian imports and wind generation absent, South Australia’s largest generator, the AGL Torrens Island Power Station, held much higher than normal market influence for the moderate demand conditions on 9 July. By structuring its market offers with substantial volumes offered at 5-digit prices, well ahead of events (note that no significant upward price rebidding occurred on the day), AGL was able to establish conditions conducive to significant price volatility unless peaking generators chose to offer far more than their normal bid volumes at low prices. The effects of the 5/30 dispatch vs settlement disparity mean that peaking generators are not likely to set up their initial bids to quash volatility, being more likely to rebid down when and if volatility actually occurs. None of this is surprising given previous similar events in the NEM, nor is it inconsistent with the market rules, and arguably not even with the basic intentions of the market design where high prices signal “scarcity” – in this case of competition, or perhaps of greater redundancy on major interconnectors. What is surprising, perhaps, is that a major gentailer decided to carry on with “business as usual” in a week where some politicians – from both ends of the spectrum – called for a Royal Commission into the electricity industry , and the ACCC was due to release a major report into drivers of retail electricity prices . We’ll see how that decision works out.

    "title": "Monday 9th July sees yo-yo prices in South Australia",
    "date": "09-07-2018 02:53:00 PM",
    "content": "It’s early afternoon on Monday 9th July as I write this, and already there’s been a number of interesting events occurring in relation to the South Australian region of the NEM. I arrived in the office this morning and checked one of our dashboard displays to see that FCAS regulation prices had been elevated over the weekend in South Australia , so posted this tweet to note that this had occurred (highlighting how interested observers could view the data themselves via the ez2view trend widget on the Hornsdale Power Reserve website , thanks to Neoen): A little later on, my phone starts buzzing with SMS alerts (available in NEMwatch and ez2view ) see that the energy price had started doing gyrations in the South Australian region, so tweeted this snapshot of the 09:20 dispatch interval from NEM-Watch v10 : I noted on this image two of the factors contributing to the morning price spikes: Factor #1 = Low wind We see that wind has dropped down close to zero in the South Australian region overnight – as a result of which thermal plant have had to pick up the slack. Incidentally we had noticed the forecast steep drop off in aggregate wind output occurring today as early as last week in discussions with other clients – so at least we can be grateful that the AEMO’s forecasts performed well in this instance, as seen through the ”Forecast Convergence” widget within ez2view snapshot from this afternoon here: Another reminder that the challenges of navigating this energy transition are far from fully sorted through… Factor #2 = Import restrictions The low wind conditions are coupled by the fact that the the flow from Victoria over the Heywood link has not been possible since about 09:00 this morning. In the snapshot from NEM-Watch above at 09:20 I noted the constraint equation that was active at the time – though there have been several having an effect. The end result is that flow has been hardwired to flow east, which is the opposite of what we could expect to see at times of low wind in South Australia – as shown in this follow up snapshot from NEM-Watch at 14:00 this afternoon: With competition disappearing in the South Australian region from two large sources (wind, and imports) it’s no wonder that prices have spiked… We also note that, through the day, the AEMO has had to take steps to manage the accumulation of negative settlements residue as a result of constraining Heywood to flow east. . . We’d been focused on other client commitments this morning so had been happy to just leave dashboard for SA running in the background whilst working on commitments from last week – however the phone kept buzzing (with SMS, and then the questions started coming in) so we looked a bit further to quickly explore a number of other contributing factors. Factor #3 = Low solar I saw that others had commented that solar in South Australia had also been suffering today as a result of cloud cover – hence had a quick look with this trended output of solar for both: aggregate small-scale solar across South Australia (both AEMO and APVI estimates, noting earlier comments about the challenges of opacity of small-scale solar PV ); and what we can see of output of Bungala Solar Farm in Port Augusta, first large-scale project to hit the boards in South Australia. This trend is produced in NEMreview v7 , and clients are able to access the template here as a starting point for their own queries : We see an effect in the order of several hundred megawatt (a little uncertain, because of the estimates), but this is not the most significant factor. Factor #4 = Gas prices As noted before, gas prices have a direct input on the price of electricity – especially in South Australia following the closure of Northern in May 2016 . Here’s another snapshot from another screen from ez2view this afternoon, highlighting today’s price at the Adelaide hub of the STTM (at $9.34/GJ) and the way in which this will be affecting most of the generation options with capacity to supply into the South Australian region today (given low wind, challenged solar and restrictions on imports): If there was more time we’d do more analysis here. Factor #5 = issues at Pelican Point In the “SA Schematic” widget included in the ez2view snapshot above we see that the Pelican Point power station had only been running at part-load through the time horizon shown in the trended capacity factor charts in the schematic. One of the questions I’d been posed from one of our callers was about why this was the case. This afternoon I’ve produced this 18-month trend of Pelican Point from NEMreview v7 , which highlights how: the station has not run at full since March, and through May has had several weeks on outage which it seems to have (partly) returned from. NEMreview clients can access my template here as a starting point for their own analysis . I’ve quickly scanned bid and rebid reasons since over the past month or so to form the impression that the reasons suggest that return to service hasn’t been as smooth as Engie (or the market more generally) would like – but there’s insufficient time to drill into the detail at this point… Factor #6 = questions about AGL at Torrens? Naturally, there are others asking questions about AGL at Torrens Island. I saw in the SA schematic above that they had 7 of 8 units running, but still less than 50% capacity factor across A and B station. No more time to look today, sorry. Offsetting Factor = Demand Response! As noted before, we have large energy users as clients in all 5 regions, representing sizeable loads (many 100MW’s). A number of our clients have loads that perform a variety of demand response services – which we know, in South Australia, would have been activated today. One of the jobs I have to get back to is to take a deeper look at some numbers to help one of them with some particular demand response optimisation challenges, hence the volatility is quite timely reminder… . . If time permits in future, we might return to this in the coming days to have a closer look….",

    "title": "Reviewing the pattern of spot prices for Q2 2018 suggests that we’re far from out of the woods, yet",
    "date": "02-07-2018 07:46:00 AM",
    "content": "It’s 2nd July, hence we’ve just ticked over into Quarter 3 – and we’ve returned to a prior theme of price outcomes seen through the Q2 period in the NEM: Q2 2016 Through the quarter as it had unfolded we’d noticed (on our dashboard displays) what seemed to be a marked change in the pattern of prices. Hence, at the end of the quarter we completed a more systematic analysis and noted that price patterns in Q2 2016 were “truly remarkable” . Q2 2017 We picked up the same theme in July 2017 to review Q2 prices for 2017 and concluded that “price outcomes for Q2 2017 were off the chart” . These thoughts were picked up in various news media organisations . Q2 2018 Based on our current analysis, we note that prices have backed off somewhat from the extreme outcomes of Q2 2017 – however it seems that we’re far from out of the woods, yet. We’ll examine this further below… Keep in mind that we selected Q2 period back in 2016 for this type of analysis as it is traditionally one of the more boring quarters – it does not see the extremes of summer demand that so affect Q1, and hence lead to significant price volatility, and is also generally less affected by low temperature demand peaks than the Q3 period. Hence the fact that we’re even talking about it at all is somewhat remarkable, in its own right. In reviewing Q2 2018, I have used the same analytical framework presented twice before, with a couple of additions: Added WA In the past 12 months our development of the upgrade to NEMreview v7 has come ahead a long way (many thanks to the great input that a diverse range of v6 clients have had on the development, through their early access to v7). Using v7 for this year’s analysis, I decided to add in what we can see of prices for the “WEM” operating in the South-West Interconnected System of Western Australia as I was curious to see what we could see. Looked at prior expectation in futures pricing Also with the ability of the “NEM Futures” data feed from ASX Energy accessible through NEMreview v7 , we took a look at the market’s expectations for the average price that Q2 2018 would deliver up to 18 months in advance. Particular focus is placed on the expectation that was in place at the end of Q2 2017. Looked at Negative Prices Through June we noticed a number of instances of negative dispatch prices in the Queensland region. I used a snapshot from NEM-Watch v10 to illustrate one of these on social media, which led to some discussions. Subsequently I posted this article about the emergence of the “Solar Correlation Penalty” on 25th June. Given the more systematic analysis of prices being conducted at the end of quarter, I also thought it useful to look specifically at the incidence of negative trading prices. Analysed FCAS prices We’ve commenced a similar analysis of FCAS prices, but it’s not yet complete (and would make this article too long, in any case). Stay tuned for these results (as Part 2 of this Analysis) in a later post… With the above as context, we’ll move onto the results. 1) Average prices in Q2 still high all regions, but down on 2017 In 2016 we saw that average prices through Q2 were elevated quite high compared with the historical range (especially remarkable after flagging the non-normal factors of the drought of 2007 and “carbon tax” period as influencing some other outliers). In 2017 we saw that the average prices had climbed “off the charts” in a very worrying sign. For 2018 we see that Q2 prices are down from the peak in 2017, but still well above the vast majority of prior years in all NEM regions. 1a) Queensland trended stats For ease of comparability, we’re starting at the top of the NEM to work our way around: In these charts, we’re showing Minimum, Maximum and Average Prices over the quarter – and for ease of readability, we’ve moved the quarterly maximum trading (i.e. 1/2 hourly) prices to the Y2-axis and shown this data series as a bar chart. 1. We can see that, for Queensland in Q2 2018, the time-weighted average price through Q2 dropped from $85.83/MWh (in 2017) to be $69.69/MWh (in 2018). However we also note that this is the 4th highest price outcome in 20 years of NEM history – with the only other higher prices being: (a) In 2007, due to the drought (which took a heavy toll on Queensland’s power generation fleet, along with threatening water supplies to the south-east corner of the state); and (b) In 2016 and 2017, with a similar pattern of prices across the quarter, as noted below. 2. We see the highest price up at $2,175/MWh and the lowest just below $0/MWh (at –$4.60/MWh) It should be noted that there are some organisations for which these higher prices are a beneficial outcome – however there are also many for whom they represent a large challenge. The fact that they have dropped by more than $15/MWh from Q2 2017 to Q2 2018 will be a refreshing outcome – however most will still be thinking that we’re not out of the woods, just yet. Moving south to NSW … 1b) NSW trended price stats Moving into NSW, we see the average price for the Quarter ($84.30/MWh), which is higher than the outcome seen in QLD (and also slightly higher than the VIC price). The average has dropped from the outcome in Q2 2017 (10% decline), but not by as much as seen in QLD (19% decline). Price outcomes in NSW for Q2 2018 are still higher than seen in Q2 2016: As was the case for Queensland, the cluster of Q2 average prices for 2016 ($76.75/MWh), 2017 ($93.62/MWh) and 2018 ($84.30/MWh) are at least $20/MWh higher than in all but one of all prior years in the NEM (with the exception being the very drought-affected 2007). I noted in last year’s post that “whilst that drought year (2007) suffered from transient issues, it is looking like what’s affecting prices in the NEM is now more deep-seated, multi-faceted, and systemic .” . The still-high results seen this year add further evidence to suggest that we have passed any turn-back point, and this new pattern of prices will be very difficult to dislodge – which will mean major challenges to a variety of energy consumers (ranging from a sizeable number of households dealing with cost of living concerns, to the major energy users that we have been serving for a decade or more). Continuing south to Victoria… 1c) Victoria trended price stats From Q2 2016 to Q2 2017, we saw the average price in VIC break $100/MWh (up at $104.92/MWh). Whilst this has now dropped by over $20/MWh (to $82.49/MWh for Q2 2018), we note that this level is still higher than the price outcome of $64.19/MWh in Q2 2016 (which was remarkable at the time). We see that the outcome for Q2 2018 is lower than in Q2 2017 (and in the drought-affected Q2 2007), but is higher than the remaining 17 other years experienced in the NEM to date . Over the water to Tasmania … 1d) Tasmania trended stats Remembering that Tasmania was faced with massive supply challenges in Q2 2016 (with perilously low hydro reserves coupled with a long-term outage on Basslink) that garnered plenty of media and political attention, last year I noted that it was mind-numbing to see that Q2 2017 was very nearly as bad (despite reasonable hydro reserves and working interconnection, and a fraction of the media attention): We see that prices for Q2 2018 have dropped significantly from the massive levels of 2016 and 2017 – that’s the “glass half full view”. The flip side of that coin is that the price for this year’s Q2 (at $76.95/MWh) is more than double the much lower prices achieved in 2015, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2006 (and almost double that of 2014, as well). Over to South Australia … 1e) South Australia trended price stats In this year (as has been the case for 5 of the 6 most recent years) we see the average Q2 price outcome is the worst of all 5 regions (as was the case also in 2017, 2015, 2014, and 2013): Here, time-weighted average spot price for Q2 2018 was at a very high level of $97.50 – though this was not as severe as the even higher level seen in Q2 2017 (of 115.93/MW). This level was beaten only by the result last year and (slightly) by the result in Q2 2013. 1f) A brief look into the WEM for the SWIS of Western Australia Given that we’re also in the process of adding in data for the market in the South-West Interconnected System (SWIS) within Western Australia into NEMreview v7 , I thought I might take a quick look at the price data we have to see how it is comparable. As noted on the chart, the market in the WEM is not an “Energy Only Market” (because there are capacity payments made to cover the generator’s cost of capacity). Hence it is reasonable to assume that average spot prices in the WEM will be lower, as a result. I don’t have too much else to add, at this point, as we don’t (yet) have much of the history of prices loaded into NEMreview . 1g) Summing up average Q2 prices all regions In the following chart, we sum up the state of NEM pricing seen across all regions of the NEM, and in the WEM: In the same vein as last year , the most important take-aways from this analysis should be: 1. That prices in Q2 2018 have come off the boil compared to the “off the charts” results seen in Q2 2017; however 2. These prices are still way out of line in comparison to the vast majority of years seen for prices in the NEM since 1999. 3. It would be very foolish for anyone to conclude that we’re anywhere near out of the woods, yet… Last year I noted a few other probable conclusions – which, with the “benefit” of seeing another year of extremes pass by in Q2 2018, seem even more likely to be true: 4. That it appears that we’re entering a new environment that’s distinctly different from the years that preceded; and 5. That this affects everyone, right across the NEM ; and finally that 6. Those pre-disposed to draw overly simplistic “it was due to … [this one factor]” conclusion are unlikely to be correct , and could be dangerously misleading . Last year I noted about “our need to rapidly increase the capacity of our thinking, to deal with a greatly increased number of wildly changing variables, currently seems to have far outstripped our collective willingness, or ability, to do this (or, in most cases, even an awareness that this intelligence gap has opened)” . With the ongoing discussions about various aspects of this energy transition it’s worth using real results to ground perspectives about the size of the challenge. Sadly the vociferous perspectives seeming to reach crescendo about the intent and design of the NEG (the “National Energy Guarantee”, with coincident webcast of the latest design iteration today ) risk narrowing our focus, when the challenge of the transition is much broader than that. As I noted last year, my sense is still that it’s likely to end in tears . 2) Looking in more detail at each region (pattern of prices, and convergence of futures) So now we see three consecutive years of extremes in average price across an erstwhile “boring” period in the market –> Q2. As we’ve done in the 2 prior years, we’ve looked more systematically across each of the regions, in order to confirm some of the more discrete observations we’ve been making on a more ongoing basis by virtue of various live updating dashboards we have at our disposal: 1. One thing we’ve done is to take all 4,368 half-hour periods through the quarter (through each of the 20 quarters of the NEM-to-date) and apportioned prices into buckets, depending on the level at which they fell. This delivers 20 discrete curves have then been overlaid on a chart for each region, with particular years of interest highlighted. These are updates on the prior year’s results. 2. Given a spike in interest in negative prices, we’ve also had a brief look at negative prices with a summary below. 3. Finally, we’ve taken a look at the market’s prior expectations for where the Q2 2018 average price would end up, utilising the end-of-day futures price data we now make available through NEMreview v7 . 2a) Negative Prices We’ll briefly cover the incidence of negative prices and then move onto the (currently) more critical instances of high prices. Last week I’d posted a few thoughts about the emergence of the “Solar Correlation Penalty” here . Whilst concern about negative prices are real for some people (we’re working with a number of generators – including some quite small – to help them avoid these instances) this chart shows that the incidences of negative prices are small at present. We expect that this will grow over time. 2b) A closer look at Queensland (distribution, and expectations) Starting again at the top of the NEM, here’s an update on last year’s chart for Queensland: As in the past 2 years, other outliers have been identified. We see that the results for Q2 2018 are not as extreme as 2017, or even 2016 – which is why the average for Q2 2018 is down on those two years. However we also see that there is still daylight between Q2 2018 and the (old?) “normal” years. There are relatively few instances where the trading price settled below $50/MWh (i.e. only 571 half-hours, or 13% of the time) – and this is in spite of the state government’s “don’t make so much money” direction in June 2017 to its government-owned generation companies (though this is still an increase on the low of 89 hours in Q2 2017). Also included here is a trended view of both end-of-day price for the Q2 2018 BASE contract for the Queensland region (created by ASX Energy), matched with the daily average spot price for the Queensland region: I’ve specifically highlighted the time when Q2 2017 ended. At that point the QLD region saw an expectation that the Q2 2018 price would end up at $72.98/MWh (where the Q2 2017 price had just clearer higher at $85.85/MWh). As noted with the arrow, that futures contract eventually paid out a year later at a slightly lower level of $69.69/MWh, so we might say that the early market expectation matched reality fairly well in that case. Indeed, we see that the cumulative average for Q2 2018 was tracking a few dollars below that eventual level, before the shaky week of early June 2018 delivered some volatility that drove the outcome higher. 2c) A closer look at NSW (distribution, and expectations) Progressing further south, we see a similar pattern in NSW: Again we see the distribution for Q2 2018 backed off somewhat from the massive levels of Q2 2017, but still miles away from the (superseded?) “normal” expectations in most prior Q2 years. We see only 217 half-hours here where the spot price ended up below $50/MWh (i.e. 4.9% of the time) in Q2 2018, though this is still greater than the miniscule 32 hours seen in Q2 2018. Adding in the futures convergence chart, and we see a story quite similar to the case for Queensland: At the end of Q2 2017 we saw an actual quarter average price of $93.62/MWh and an expectation that the result the next year would be $90.90/MWh. As was the case with Queensland, the end result was a Q2 2018 price lower (at $84.30/MWh) than the expectation of a year prior. 2d) A closer look at Victoria (distribution, and expectations) Moving into Victoria, we see a similar picture: In 2016 I highlighted “2007 and 2016 as the standouts” – however those years paled into insignificance to the onslaught of Q2 2017 (where m ore than half of all half-hours through the quarter saw spot prices greater than $100/MWh). We see that the result for Q2 2018 was a little more moderate – though it does still appear to be the 2nd worst year by most measures. Not quite as severe as in NSW, we saw 427 half-hours below $50/MWh (i.e. 9.8% of the time) – which was a large improvement on Q2 2017 (83 hours, or only 1.9% of the time), however still a long way from historical norms. With the futures convergence chart for Victoria, we see that the expectation for Q2 2018 ($106.00/MWh) at the end of Q2 2017 ($104.92/MWh) was actually higher than what the prior quarter ended up being – but the actual result ($82.49/MWh) was significantly lower than that expectation (though still higher than many would wish for it to be). 2e) A closer look at Tasmania (distribution, and expectations) We saw (with the averages above) that Tasmania seemed to have made the most dramatic improvement, at last in terms of average prices. We see in the distribution chart below that the curve has shifted a long way to the right compared with Q2 2017 – however it’s still much further to the left than most other prior years: In Q2 2017 the incidence of prices under $50/MWh had “completely evaporated” (only 1.6% of the time) – and whilst this has increased threefold in Q2 2018, n frequency of only 5.4% of the time with prices below $50/MWh was considered (at least historically) as nowhere near enough… The ASX does not offer hedge contracts for the Tasmanian region, so we do not have visibility of the markets prior expectations for the quarter just passed. However we have noted how the average price from Q2 2017 to Q2 2018 did see a substantial reduction. 2f) A closer look at South Australia (distribution, and expectations) Finally, we land at South Australia and see a picture for Q2 2018 that is only partially moderated from the “truly horrendous” picture for Q2 2017. In particular, note the very high incidence of prices above $100/MWh: 1. In Q2 2018 it was 1,144 half-hours – or 33 % of the time – above $100/MWh ) ; 2. This is about half the level of Q2 2017 (with 2,945 half-hours – or 67% of the time – above $100/MWh ) but we need to not lose sight of the fact that a 33% incidence of >$00/MWh prices is still significantly more than any other year (except 2017) . For the other regions we have been comparing instances of prices under $50/MWh – for SA it was only 9.2% of the time in Q2 2018. Looking at futures convergence we see a similar situation as was the case in Victoria, where: 1) At the end of Q2 2017 (a horrendous period, averaging $115.93/MWh) the expectation then was that Q2 2018 would be worse (futures price trading at $123.90/MWh); but that 2) The actual result ended up significantly lower (at $97.50/MWh) but still way above where most people would like it to be . 2h) Analysis for the SWIS in Western Australia We don’t (currently) have more than 2 years’ worth of price history for the WA market loaded into NEMreview v7 , so the following chart for WA is included for completeness apart from anything else: Interestingly, we see that half-hour prices in the WEM were below $50/MWh for a massive 70% of the time during Q2 2018 (or 3,061 half-hours). That’s up from the high level of Q2 2017 (at 2,693 half hours or 62% of the time). However keep in mind the impact that the capacity market will have had on bidding behaviour, and hence price outcomes. 2i) Summing up, for all regions Selecting just the incidence of prices above $100/MWh for each region and trending over time, we see the following summary: We see again that (quite literally) some instances for Q2 2017 were off the chart (SA, TAS and almost VIC). These stratospheric levels have subsided somewhat into Q2 2018 – however the levels seen are still far higher than most of the other years on the plot. In a complex system (such as the NEM) it’s almost certain that, with most events, there are always multiple contributing factors . In other posts here on WattClarity we’ve been delving into some of these – however there’s never enough time to complete all the investigations we’d like to mount….",

    "title": "Further thoughts on the emergence of the “Solar Correlation Penalty”",
    "date": "25-06-2018 04:04:00 PM",
    "content": "The level of correlation that exists between the established fleet of wind farms that gives rise to the wind correlation penalty we’ve posted about for a couple of years is not immediately obvious to the eye. Hence why the “it’s always windy somewhere” mantra that’s sometimes used as a magic wand that some see will play a large role in “solving” the intermittency challenge . 1. That’s not to say that all wind farms are perfectly correlated in output – but to note that they (at least the ones that exist currently) are not perfectly anti-correlated , either – which is the assumption that “it’s always windy somewhere” magic wand relies upon. 2. But enough about wind, today… The strong underlying correlation of solar production across all solar production is much easier to visualise, an intuitively understand. Apart from a time-shift of 1-2 hours from the easternmost part of the NEM to the westernmost part, the sun’s always shining at the same point in time right across the NEM (notwithstanding cloud cover, shading and possibly other local factors). This high degree of correlation has been a looming challenge that we have been puzzling about increasingly of late. Our thinking is partly to understand how much change has already happened to date, but it’s moreso with a view to the future : 1) We’re thinking through all the possible implications as the ongoing “solarcoaster” ride ramps up its speed in the coming 12-24 months with the influx of a massive volume of solar PV to hit the Queensland region of the NEM – both in terms of large-scale solar (which will be seen relatively easily by AEMO), and small-scale solar (which has its own challenges of opacity ). 2) We’re even thinking about longer-term implications that might come into play under various guises. Our thinking is driven by the realisation that the needs of our diverse range of clients might change pretty dramatically in the years and decades ahead – and we need to be ahead of the curve in order to ensure we have new products ready for them when they arrive at that point. The invitation is always open – if you’d like to work with us in some form to help us understand the implications of this energy transition , and what it might mean for (existing and potential new) clients, then contact us one-on-one to discuss. (A) We’d thought that major effects might be some years away… To be honest, we’d been working on the assumption that major effects of the influx of solar PV were still a couple of years away in the NEM. However the advantage of running dashboard-style products (like our trusty NEMwatch v10 entry level dashboard, but including other higher-end ones as well) is that we can progressively get the sense of things subtly changing out of the corner of our eye , even when focused on the here-and-now of our current commitments to clients. Through 2018 we’ve been tugged by a growing sense that change might be occurring more quickly than we’d previously thought. (B) A couple comments on social media On Tuesday 19th June through one of our display copies of NEMwatch v10 , I noted an instance where the 5-minute dispatch price in Queensland was dropping to $0/MWh or below. I tweeted this image from the 10:00 dispatch interval showing the QLD price at –$.05/MWh (which led to some discussion online and offline): (click on the image to open a full-screen view of the original NEMwatch image). I note that one of the comments on that thread highlighted the reduction in export capacity reduction from QLD to NSW that was occurring at the time of this (slight) negative price – which is discussed further below . About 5 weeks prior to that (back on Friday 18 May), I also tweeted this annotated image from a NEMreview v7 trend highlighting the way in which (for the 7 days in question) the higher prices had been pushed outside of the daylight hours when solar injections were occurring: In this case, my tweet then was referenced to this earlier article on WattClarity about the emergence of a “Solar Correlation Penalty” . I note that the same person had also added a comment on the thread in the tweet seemingly misinterpreting the thinking behind that tweet, but explained more clearly (I hope?) in that article. (C) Expanding on what was observed on and around Tuesday 19th June One person who asked questions as a result of the tweets above was Giles Parkinson over at RenewEconomy – as a result of which he’s posted this article “Solar pushes mid-day electricity prices below zero in Queensland” on Monday 25th June . For those who want to understand more of my thinking, I’ve included some here. Using NEMreview v7 and deliberately expanding the date selection out to include 4 days over last week (Monday 18th June to Thursday 21st June) we have the following annotated image (click image for a larger resolution image to read): Remembering the inherent over-simplification that occurs almost always in the NEM when attributing any outcome to a single action or change , I’ve flagged a number of things that were visible at the time, and summarised in the chart above: (C1) Demand shape Since the NEM started, demand during winter months has been typically shaped like a 2-hump camel – lesser morning peak, and then higher evening peak. 1) Across the NEM (but in Queensland in particular), demand for use of air-conditioning (either in heating or cooling) is reduced during the middle of days like that were experienced last week compared with demand for for climate control in the mornings and evenings. 2) This underlying demand shape has historically lent itself to evening price spikes during winter. If we’re thinking about “Operational Demand” (see *) , the shape (which has been with us for 20+ years) is being accentuated in more recent times by the advent of small-scale solar which acts below the visibility of the AEMO to reduce – sometimes called the “duck curve” , or in Australia a localised “emu curve” moniker. (*) See this early explanation of the gory details about the different definitions of demand that the AEMO uses . . (C2) Generation from coal As seen in the chart, the aggregate generation from coal-fired power stations the demand shape shown on the diagram (the demand shown is AEMO’s “Demand and Non-Scheduled Generation”, which is close to what they refer to as “Operational Demand”). It’s been noted before the effect that the QLD Government’s “don’t make too much money, we’re copping political heat” directive to the GOCs has had on increasing volume available at lower prices than would have otherwise been the case in prior years. We’ve not had time to check this particular week in June against prior weeks in June from 2016 and before, so wonder about the extent to which this would be a factor in the above. . (C3) Export limitations Last week (including on the 19th) the flow south from QLD into NSW was constrained down from what it will normally be, meaning less capacity to “spill” surplus power into NSW – an eyeball check of the flows on the trend chart above compared with Thursday 21st shows exports were approximately 700MW lower on Tuesday . This is the point made on Twitter in response to my tweet last week. My perspective was not so much what was happening last week – but (as noted in the tweet ) what it suggested might be the case in future. In other words – if the “market” for generation from QLD reduced by only 700MW in the middle of the day, we see spot prices drop to levels below the short-run marginal cost of generation for the coal fleet in Queensland based on volumes and price bands offered last week . Clearly this would not be sustainable over a long time period. . (C4) The looming solar factor On the chart I have included three lines for solar: 1. Two different estimates are included for illustrative purposes for small-scale solar (from APVI and AEMO – each from different methods, with the difference in the numbers illustrating the challenge in their opacity ). Readers should not misconstrue that this supply was having the effect of meeting the “Operational Demand” shown in the chart (as this supply acts to net off the “Operational Demand” visible to the AEMO ). It has been included to illustrate scale – both in terms of: (a) how much the Operational Demand was lower last week by virtue of the solar production last week; and (b) also to get readers thinking about what increases in this output would also do – given the ongoing rate of installation of rooftop PV in Queensland. 2. I’ve also included a trend for existing Large Solar in QLD that is contributing data – which peaks at about 130MW on the 19th. The point I tried to make via social media was that 130MW is only the start , and there’s a huge influx such that, in a year’s time, there will be magnitude large contribution . Unfortunately I could have been clearer in my explanation last week (so hopefully this post will help those who follow through). If mid-day prices in QLD dropped below coal gen SRMC with 700MW of export capacity out of service (comparing Tuesday and Thursday), it’s easy to see how (assuming the coal generators bid the same way) the price in winter next year, or even perhaps by September 2018, will be bouncing just around zero much more commonly during non-summer, sunny days. This will pose challenges to the government-owned operators of the existing coal fleet, for sure – but it will also pose challenges to any wholesale-exposed generators in future, including the number of solar farms that we’re finding (in the compilation of the Generator Catalog ) are being constructed and commissioned with a share of merchant exposure. Welcome to the “Solar Correlation Penalty” . W. (D) Analysis using trended volume-weighted prices (referencing the ERM solar shapes) On Wednesday 13th June, guest author Dave Guiver provided this article about two new hedge options created by ERM Power as one option to help people hedge around a typical shape of solar production. Dave’s article highlighted an opportunity to use those shapes (which vary month-to-month over the year) and provide for a yin-and-yang comparison of “Solar” and “No Solar” volume-weighted average prices, in order to be a bit more systematic in understanding the degree of influence that this has had to date. Generously ERM has provided me with the details of the shapes, and I have some analysis partially complete. I’ll post the results of this analysis on WattClarity when it’s ready to go…",

    "title": "New hedging options emerge in the NEM as the energy transition accelerates",
    "date": "13-06-2018 07:11:00 AM",
    "content": "As the proportion of electricity generation shifts from largely dispatchable technologies to an increasing amount of intermittent supply sources, such as wind and solar, new products and services will emerge in the wholesale market to manage price risk. ERM Power recently released an innovative set of derivatives into the market that provide both price transparency and facilitate the risk management of solar generation. With the rise of new generation companies entering the National Electricity Market, and the heightened interest from corporate customers considering asset backed renewable energy procurement strategies, it became apparent that a need existed for both ‘firming products’ and for a greater understanding in the difference between non-firm and firm pricing. (1) Solar Profile Product The solar profile product pairs a monthly profiled electricity swap with a forward settled large-scale generation certificate (LGC). Each month has a pre-defined half-hourly profiled swap that replicates the typical production of a single-axis tracking farm. Profiles will vary month to month to reflect changing generation output throughout the year. Put simply, the profile will be wider in summer and narrower in winter. LGCs are matched to the swap on a one LGC for one MWh basis. Each calendar year that equates to 34,288 LGCs (as there are 34,288MWh in the profiled electricity swap each year), per 10MW of capacity. Besides the benefits this product delivers for hedging purposes, it also provides useful price information on the trend of ‘sunlight hour’ electricity swaps. Currently parties can easily access the price of flat and peak swaps, however the price of the sunlight hours is quite opaque. Buyers and sellers will both benefit from the increased price discovery this product brings, particularly those considering negotiating a power purchase agreement. Naturally the price of a ‘firm volume’ swap, such as the solar profile product , will be priced at a premium to a non-firm run of generation meter product. (2) Solar Firming Product The second derivative, known as the solar firming product , is an electricity swap for all hours in a year that are not included within the solar profile product . LGCs are not paired with the second product. A transaction for 10MW of capacity for this product would amount to 53,312MWh per annum. It is anticipated that the most popular use for the solar firming product will be as a complimentary hedging strategy for solar generators. Solar generators could sell flat swaps on the open market, and buy back the solar firming product therefore leaving themselves exposed to pool prices for only the few hours that their solar generation does not correlate with the firming product. This residual risk maybe mitigated through insurance strategies, battery storage, contractual agreements with peaking generation, or alternatively held on their books as an open risk position. At the time of writing, environmental market brokers TFS Green had pricing in Qld, NSW, Victoria and South Australia on a number of these products. Organisations wishing to transact these products would have generally entered into standard market agreements with brokers and other wholesale counterparties, such as retailers and generators. These new product concepts have been well received by the market and while liquidity has initially been focused with TFS Green, we anticipate other similar product innovations will continue to emerge across the market.

    "title": "Recapping a shaky week for the supply-demand balance in the NSW region last week (Mon 4th June to Fri 8th June 2018)",
    "date": "11-06-2018 09:16:00 AM",
    "content": "Last week I had several reasons to be in-and-around Sydney for the whole week – which meant that, in between commitments with clients and others, I took a particular interest in the AEMO’s Low Reserve Condition notices (and notice about triggering the Reserve Trader), along with a bit of media coverage (and a few questions from journalists) about the tight supply/demand balance. This week was certainly one which: 1) Generated considerable attention (understandably so); 2) Saw a number of overly simplistic identification of the cause of the tight supply/demand balance; but 3) Highlights some challenges ahead in this ongoing energy transition – both in terms of what physically happens in the grid, and also in terms of how we (collectively) view and understand what’s happening . I’m travelling again much of this week, but have put together the following summary as the questions I received through last week suggest that this might be of interest to those who asked the questions – and could be for others as well. (A) A brief summary, day-by-day Given that it was a very busy week (both for us as a company, and for the broader National Electricity Market) I have tried to summarise some of the key points from each of the days in this table. Note that this table cannot hope to be comprehensive – and probably has errors (if you see any, please do point them out to help out other readers – or, if you’re shy, let me know one-on-one). The same goes for the whole post, which has been pasted together in a few hours here-and-there snatched in between our more direct role in helping specific clients. The AEMO, AER and others will (I expect) put together far more detailed reports in due course. In the analysis we share on WattClarity , we seek to provide value by sharing insights sooner than would be the case if our readers were awaiting the formal reports from AEMO, AER and others. However readers need to keep in mind the possibility of errors and omissions. In that light, we hope you will find this of value. What happened inside the market Outside, but related to, the market Sunday 3 rd June I’ve prepared here a (web-based) Trend Widget in ez2view, and time-travelled back to 12:35 on Sunday 3 rd June to show what market expectations were at the time: ( click on the image for a larger view) At that time, P30 predispatch had pushed out till 04:00 on Tuesday 5 th June, and this is combined with the forecast from ST PASA to show the expectation that the week ahead would be fairly similar to the prior week. There were a couple things I needed to do in preparation for the training sessions that would come during that week – but certainly was not giving much thought to the supply/demand balance that would emerge through the week. Ironically, there were a number of Market Notices issued over prior days about forecast LOR1 & LOR2 Low Reserve Conditions for Monday 4 th June – but in South Australia not NSW. These look-ahead warnings had been cancelled prior to Sunday. Monday 4 th June Based on Market Notices we conclude that the period of Actual LOR was as follows: 15:00 $73.95/MWh 15:30 $82.83/MWh 16:00 $98.89/MWh 16:30 $94.24/MWh 17:00 $131.54/MWh 17:30 LOR1 starts $140.75/MWh 18:00 $289.90/MWh 18:30 $238.39/MWh 19:00 LOR1 concludes $139.64/MWh 19:30 $105.90/MWh 20:00 $106.53/MWh I was in Sydney on the day, meeting with a range of clients (and prospective clients) – including new entrant generators, like the client we spend the day with the following day. Through the day I was not playing close attention to the machinations of the market. Tuesday 5 th June Based on Market Notices we conclude that the period of Actual LOR was as follows: 15:00 $96.51/MWh 15:30 $139.18/MWh 16:00 LOR1 starts $184.12/MWh 16:30 $181.66/MWh 17:00 $151.27/MWh 17:30 $2,428.77/MWh 18:00 (also QLD) $81.33/MWh 18:30 LOR2 begins 18:20 $2,447.89/MWh Low IRPM alerts 19:00 LOR2 ends $104.51/MWh 19:30 LOR1 ends $95.25/MWh 20:00 $172.26/MWh * note that there was also a (related) LOR1 condition in the QLD region from 18:00 to 18:30. At 10:34 on Sunday 10 th June, AEMO took the (infrequently used) step of issuing this media release about what happened on Tuesday 5 th June. Particularly jumping out to me was this note: “As market and system operator, last week’s events in NSW are a sobering reminder that even outside of the traditional summer peak periods, there is still a need to ensure adequate resources are available to manage the system.” On Tuesday I was (with Jonathon Dyson ) with a new client of ours, providing a full day training session on how dispatch works, and hence how prices are set in the NEM. This client is a new generation participant in the NEM, and has adopted ez2view . We have learnt from experience that it’s best to provide this context in order that new entrants to the market can understand to use the software. We’ve also learnt that it’s best for us to incorporate the input of people like Jonathon (and Allan O’Neil ) on occasions to provide the best value over a full day. Hence the unfolding events through the day provided an interesting backdrop to the content of the day. On the way back from the training session, I was inundated with SMS alerts noting both the high prices – but also (perhaps more interesting for me) notification of low Instantaneous Reserve Plant Margin (IRPM) NEM-wide for the time of evening peak. That’s something that really happens quite rarely (much less often than price volatility), as discussed below. Wednesday 6 th June Based on Market Notices we conclude that the period of Actual LOR was as follows: 15:00 $86.05/MWh 15:30 $85.56/MWh 16:00 $109.03/MWh 16:30 $180.40/MWh 17:00 LOR1 starts $164.78/MWh 17:30 $146.78/MWh 18:00 $110.88/MWh 18:30 $130.22/MWh 19:00 $101.03/MWh 19:30 LOR1 ends $126.18/MWh 20:00 $112.72/MWh Wednesday 6th June was day #1 of the Energy Networks 2018 conference in Sydney, which I was fortunate to attend.A number of the speakers made comments about the growing challenges that will come from the lack of visibility (and in some cases control) of distributed energy resources – which led to coverage and commentary in a number of places, like: 1) in the SMH on Wednesday 6th June with Cole Latimer writing that “Too much of a good thing: solar power surge is flooding the grid” . 2) on RenewEconomy ( “ ‘Time to take control’ of rooftop solar, industry says ” on 6th and then “What’s behind the scare campaign on rooftop solar ‘blackout’ threat” on the 7th, currently with 126 comments ); 3) in “’ ‘Dumb solar’ threat to grid stability: Greensync’s Blythe” the Australian on 7th June , and We’ve long understood the need for more visibility of Distributed Energy Resources, and particularly battery storage systems – which is why we’ve been working with the Smart Energy Council for a number of years to create a national Energy Storage Register that is sustainable, and not a cost burden to those who don’t need/want it. As an interim step, information from our Battery Finder widget (now up to 211 makes and models) is now assisting the Clean Energy Regulator to populate their voluntary data collection process . We also understand that “control” is a more emotive and hence problematic topic on the continuum of the Emotion-o-Meter – even if you couch it in softer terms like “orchestration”. Another challenge ahead for the broader electricity sector (including all users) to reach a pragmatic approach as this energy transition picks up pace. Thursday 7 th June At 17:26 the AEMO issued Market Notice #63128 notifying of the “Intention to Implement an AEMO Intervention Event with RERT” . It flagged the possibility that they might dispatch the Reserve Trader from 17:30 to 18:00. Based on Market Notices we conclude that the period of Actual LOR was as follows: 15:00 $87.83/MWh 15:30 $92.71/MWh 16:00 $98.37/MWh 16:30 $146.85/MWh 17:00 LOR1 starts $172.77/MWh 17:30 LOR2 starts $2,438.00/MWh Perhaps RERT dispatched? 18:00 $119.32/MWh 18:30 $104.91/MWh 19:00 LOR 2 concludes $2,464.52/MWh 19:30 $89.24/MWh 20:00 LOR1 concludes $100.91/MWh On Thursday I was at the 2 nd day of the ENA’s “Energy Networks 2018” conference. During the last session of the day, in between juggling messages about what was happening in the market, I was fortunate to catch an update from Flow Power about their particular approach to matching: 1) renewables-backed PPAs with 2) spot-induced demand response capability for the unhedged volumes. The comment that jumped out at me was that their volume of business had tripled in 18 months – it would seem that they are doing something right. I posted this article about the cessation of declining demand in NSW that evening, but also flagged on Twitter and LinkedIn about the Low Reserve Condition warnings by the AEMO. No time to do more that night… By 19:27, Peter Ker, Angela Macdonald-Smith and Mark Ludlow at the AFR had updated this article “Energy grid in crisis as winter power outages hit” . With respect to my comment on Demand Response on social media I am interested to (albeit later) read these paragraphs in the news article: “AGL and Tomago have a commercial agreement where decisions can be taken to reduce energy demand to minimise exposure to the spot price.” and: “Tomago, which is jointly owned by Rio Tinto, CSR and Hydro Aluminium, took a potline offline for 45 minutes on Tuesday, and two of its potlines offline for an hour each on Thursday.” This would go some way to explain what appeared to be demand response when I had inspected the NEMwatch image posted online. Friday 8 th June Based on Market Notices we conclude that the period of Actual LOR was as follows: 15:00 $99.12/MWh 15:30 $139.33/MWh 16:00 $271.77/MWh 16:30 $254.05/MWh Cold weather, and poor solar notice 17:00 LOR1 starts $299.60/MWh 17:30 LOR2 starts $135.79/MWh RERT notice 18:00 $122.40/MWh 18:30 $2,444.49/MWh 19:00 LOR 2 concludes $195.69/MWh 19:30 $148.96/MWh 20:00 $237.35/MWh 20:30 $299.60/MWh 21:00 LOR1 concludes $137.43/MWh At 16:19, AEMO issued a Market Notice (#63152) indicating how cold & cloudy conditions , and hence the lack of solar PV, was another challenge they were dealing with: “Weather conditions across the Sydney basin are currently up to 7 degrees below the day-ahead temperature forecast, from all AEMO’s weather providers. In addition, heavier than forecast cloud cover has reduced the output of rooftop solar generation , resulting in increased demand. These deviations in weather conditions have resulted in increased actual and forecast peak demand for the NSW region. The current NSW operational peak demand forecast is 10,865MW at 1800hrs on 8/06/2018, as at 1600hrs 8/06/2018.” (see chart included below showing a startling picture of this!) At 17:14 AEMO issued a Market Notice of “Intention to Implement an AEMO Intervention Event with RERT”, noting that this might be triggered between 17:30 and 18:00. On Friday I was outside of Sydney providing some training to a new client that’s come onboard recently. This client is becoming another new addition to those (invisible or at least opaque) spot-exposed Demand Response providers I spoke about here – hence they had great interest in what had happened on Thursday. With the use of ez2view I was able to walk them through (using Time Travel) some of the key events leading up to the price spikes on Thursday – including (importantly) what the AEMO’s forecasts had indicated prior to the spikes occurring. On RenewEconomy, Giles Parkinson posted his article “NSW grid struggles as coal goes missing after bad trips” . Over at the SMH, Peter Hannam and Cole Latimer posted their article “Tomago Aluminium warns of ‘energy crisis’ as power supply falters” at 13:38 and later updated at 18:35. Saturday 9 th June Based on Market Notices we conclude that the period of Actual LOR was as follows: 15:00 15:30 16:00 16:30 17:00 17:30 18:00 18:30 LOR1 starts 19:00 LOR1 ends 19:30 20:00 . At 06:00, Ian Kirkwood of the Newcastle Herald had posted this article “Tomago Aluminium says NSW power grid in crisis” referencing the problems in NSW and comments made by the head of the locally-based Tomago Aluminium smelter. The article also included an image of our RenewEconomy-sponsored NEMwatch widget which readers can find live here , here , and many other places (no charge to embed on your own website). At 17:38 on Saturday 9 th June, Andrew White at the Australian published this article “Outages see power prices hit the roof” that includes some comments from me (provided Friday) about how much coal had been unavailable through the week. Sunday 10 th June 2018 At 10:34 on Sunday 10th June the AEMO took the (slightly unusual) step of posting this media release about what happened on Tuesday, as noted above. We presume there might also be a notice in train for Thursday and Friday? In between other commitments, I pieced together most of this analysis on Sunday 11 th June to ensure I could concentrate on our “real job” of serving direct clients on Monday. If you know of other significant events I have missed in the above (and I have time to add them in) I would be happy to include them? . (B) Some particular observations Building from the table above, we pull out a few key driving factors (again, remembering that this is far from complete) in order to highlight a few insights – both with respect to what happened last week but also (more importantly, in our view) pointing to more serious thinking that needs to happen on the route to this ongoing energy sector transformation . (B1) It was a bad week for coal A number of others have made this point frequently through the week, so I won’t labour the point here. Unfortunately some of those same people have slipped into an analytical trap of jumping from identification of one cause, to the assumption that it’s the only cause . The following chart from NEMreview v7 sums up the scale of the generation fleet that went missing over the prior week (as I noted to Andrew White when he contacted me, there was about 2,000MW of coal-fired power that had disappeared from the supply stack over the 7 days to Friday 8th June): Whilst it is understandable (and acceptable) that all plant needs to be maintained at different times, and logical that this would happen at a time of relatively modest demand, what is particularly concerning is the coincidence of forced outages. This is certainly one (major) contributing factor to the tight supply/demand balance and high prices (a point strongly made by the “Coal Fail Twitterati”) – but it seems not to be the only one (something not really acknowledged by those same “Coal Fail Twitterati”), based on the analysis I’ve been able to do. Given my background in Mechanical Engineering at thermal plant, and (decades ago) an interest in remnant life issues, I am very aware of the possibility that the rear lip of the “bathtub curve” of Forced Outage Rate might be making its presence felt with the older plant , exacerbated by the mess we have been making of this energy transition (which seems to me to be the main thrust of the concern raised by Matt Howell at Tomago Aluminium – as reported in the AFR , SMH , Herald , Australian , and elsewhere). I know that others have been quick to give their verdict on that case – however I have not yet had time to perform a detailed analysis of the numbers (it’s more complex to do properly than might initially seem) so can’t say either way. (B2) Gas-fired generation helped at peak, but had availability challenges Coupled with problems at a number of coal fired plant, we saw the gas-fired fleet in NSW experience dips in availability around the time of the price spikes – as shown in the same 14-day trend from NEMreview v7 : Utilising the (under intensive development) “Station Details Widget” within our ez2view software (v7.4.2) and focused on Snowy Hydro’s gas-fired Colongra peaking plant for the two day period Thursday 8th June and Friday 9th June (particularly singling out the price spike to $14,000 at 18:30 on Friday 9th) we see that the plant had about 250MW offered down at –$1,000/MWh at the times of both evening peaks: Another picture from ez2view juxtaposing 3 widgets in a window (like that which I showed to our clients on Friday, but to illustrate a spike earlier in the week) there was very little capacity offered in NSW between the volume offered by Eraring at $52.57/MWh (at the RRN) and the price-setting bids from Colongra at $14,000/MWh (at the RRN). This illustrates the reason why the price spiked so dramatically on Friday evening: As highlighted, the capacity of solar and wind that was offered could not dispatch and the volume of generation offered by Snowy for Lower Tumut could not be fully dispatched because its output was being constrained (discussed briefly below). I have not had time to check on the specifics of whether gas plant availability dipped at the time of the other spikes, contributing to them. (B3) Hydro helped to “save the day” – but was subject to congestion Utilising NEMreview v7 to again produce a 14-day look-back, but this time focused on Hydro resources in NSW (including part of the Snowy scheme) we see the output peaking up around the total of the capacity available at each of the three instances where the price spiked. I noted that (at 18:30 on Friday 8th June) the TUMUT3 DUID could not be fully dispatched because it was subject to a bound constraint. A view of this particular constraint is provided in the Constraint Details view below: This constraint (called “N^^N_NIL_1”) is a “System Normal” constraint (so invoked all the time) and will seek to wind down the output of all the elements on the Left-Hand Side when bound (where they have a positive factor). Snowy Hydro was effectively competing with flow north from VIC to get dispatched into the NSW reference node – hence this seems to be the reason why it would have offered so much volume down at –$1,000/MWh from 17:10 (i.e. prior to the spike) – though we do remember that we can’t know , with certainty, why they shifted volume thus . A key point, here, is that (if this situation were to occur in future under similar circumstances when Snowy 2.0 were available) the amount of energy that could actually generate and make its way to market would not be any different than last week – without transmission augmentation. Certainly the same, too, for Tassie’s “Battery of the Nation” proposal for the same reasons. Both options would (in this instance) have no incremental value. (B4) Wind output was lower over the entire 2 week period, and dropped at time of price spikes Also utilising NEMreview v7 we look at aggregate output of wind across all of the NSW wind farms and see that the output was about mid-range compared to its range over the 14 days on each of the 3 occasions of price spike. As noted in this chart, this 2 week period seems quite low (though perhaps not quite as low as the becalmed June 2017 ), with instantaneous output only rising above 50% capacity factor on 2 occasions over that 2 week period. As noted above, for instance, White Rock Wind Farm could not produce anything at the time of the price spike at 18:30 on Friday 8th June. Hence an objective view of the plant that went missing would need to add the 1,000MW (approx) of wind capability that did not turn up at each of the three occasions when the prices spiked last week and the supply/demand balance was threatened. (B5) Solar harvest was particularly poor on some days, and not available at evening spike time Again using NEMreview v7 we look at aggregate output from the growing fleet of NSW Large Solar farms over the same 14 day period. The obvious point to make, for a start, was that the spikes occurred each time after sunset – hence we knew in advance that solar would be contributing nothing. This was (understandably) also the case when looking at estimates for small-scale solar output in NEMreview v7 here: In the case of small-scale, the analysis is complicated further by the opacity of distributed small-scale solar PV . This opacity will become a more significant (genuine) challenge for AEMO, the DNSPs and others moving forwards – which was why some comments were made about a need for visibility (and, in some cases, control) at the Energy Networks 2018 conference last week. With a particular focus on last week, another observation can be made in that: (a) The dispersion of large solar outside of the Newcastle-Sydney-Wollongong population zone meant that it was not affected, as much, by the broad band of heavy cloud cover and rain that affected Sydney through the week – though it might be subject to transmission congestion in the same way as was the Snowy units (discussed above); but (b) The distributed rooftop PV, whilst avoiding possible transmission issues, was more highly correlated with the cloud cover and so more affected in that way. Neither is a panacea. As noted on the images, the effects last week are food for thought on the scale required to have dependable “time-shifting” of solar output that might, in future, be used to help address winter evening peaks in demand and correlated price spikes. (B6) Demand was affected by the weather, and difficult to forecast As noted above, AEMO issued a slightly unusual Market Notice on Friday 8th June noting the difficulties they were experiencing in relation to weather forecasts – and hence the linked forecasts for small-scale PV output , and electricity demand. Winding a “Forecast Convergence” window of ez2view back in “Time Travel” to 18:30 on the day reveals a startling picture: As highlighted in the image, demand forecast error was as high as 800MW on Friday afternoon – which was a little under half the volume of coal missing on Friday, and also just lower than the volume of wind missing. Hence very material to market outcomes that day, and also all week. As noted in the image, I suspect that the weather forecasting difficulties compounded themselves by: Factor #1) Meaning that projections for small-scale PV production in the Newcastle-Sydney-Wollongong were too optimistic, leaving more demand to be serviced by the grid (remembering this explainer about different elements of demand ); Factor #2) Because of cloud/rain cover, there also would have been a higher demand for electricity for lighting; and Factor #3) AEMO mentions the cooler weather (7 degrees under forecast) which presumably would have meant for higher heating load. One more challenge that the AEMO had to deal with, as they noted in their Market Notice. It’s worth noting that the challenges with demand forecasting were most pronounced at the depths of the duck, and at time of evening peak in demand. Whilst the evening demand peaks were the times of the huge price excursions (Tue, Thu and Fri), prices were elevated throughout the day – hence getting the forecast “wrong” even at the depths of the duck would have had cost impacts last week. (B7) Demand Response certainly did help As noted above, I posted this snapshot from NEMwatch v10 on social media on Thursday night – though I did not have time to do much more than that at the time. week. I did postulate on Twitter at the time that it appeared that demand response had triggered in both NSW and QLD at the time – presumably driven by the high dispatch price spike (and presumably also including clients of ours): As noted in the media reports noted above, Tomago Aluminium smelter was certainly one of the energy users providing this demand response. We suspect that there were others of our clients as well – though, as noted before, this is opaque for a number of (quite reasonable) reasons . We have appreciated our role in helping to progressively growing the scale of demand response in the NEM. However there are still many challenges for us (and some others) in continuing to grow this form of demand response in the NEM. These barriers are not the same as what some other commentators would propose. That’s food for another post at a later time… (B8) Transmission limitations played a role One more time using NEMreview v7 , we look at the flow north from Victoria into NSW over the interconnectors (mainly) through the Snowy area over the same 14 day window: As can be seen from the chart (and as illustrated above for the case of 18:30 on Friday 8th June) flows north from Victoria suffered from transmission congestion and the effect of market participants in the southern part of NSW bidding down at the market floor price to avoid being wound down in preference to flows in from Victoria. This is an example of the type of congestion that will need to be reduced if the energy transition is to be successful with a vastly different topology of remote, large-scale generation sources. This was the subject of a number of sessions at the Energy Networks 2018 conference. We use the same approach for flow south from Queensland (combining QNI and Terranora) and produce the following chart. To help our more novice readers we have reversed the typical AEMO number sign on interconnectors with this one – meaning that (in this instance) flow from QLD to NSW is shown as positive: As highlighted in the chart, flows south from QLD were running at, or very close to the limit – possibly suggesting more interconnector transfer could be beneficial. However coupled with this, we note that 3 of the 5 price spike events in NSW also saw prices spike in QLD. Hence would need to assess in more detail before jumping to conclusions about the merits that an upgrade would have had last week, had it been available then. There are a number of other factors we could look at, but I have run out of time to do this. . (C) Preliminary conclusions This post has been thrown together with time pressure over the weekend, and probably has a number of errors included. In the process of preparing this analysis, I have been reflecting on some preliminary conclusions that could be drawn. (C1) This was just one more example of the challenges of the energy transition As noted by the AEMO in the media release provided on Sunday 10th June , last week was “a sobering reminder” that there is much to be done to ensure that the supply and demand balance can be managed into the future, as the energy transition picks up pace. The events of the SA Blackout of 28th September 2016 were one other obvious example, but there have been plenty more – some of which we have been trying to reference (as time has permitted) on WattClarity . (C2) Industrial energy users are genuinely under threat It wasn’t an accident that the CEO of Tomago Aluminium was quoted in 4 of the leading newspapers covering the NSW region, and further afield, with respect to what happened through the week. It also was totally understandable that our new clients whom I met with on Friday last week (another major energy user, also walking down the path of incorporating spot-exposed demand response into their procurement practices) was intensely interested in understanding just what was going on through the week. Both these businesses are under threat – with perceptions of increased risk to reliability, and increased cost pressures. It’s important to remember that business use of electricity dwarfs residential use in the NEM – though you wouldn’t think that this was the case if you just listened to certain people in the energy sector who, when selling their preferred policy changes, like to spell things out in terms of increases in residential electricity user bills. We know that our friends at Energy Consumers Australia (who we have worked with to provide this consumption widget ), and in other advocacy organisations are very aware about (and concerned for) the plight of income-constrained residential energy users. We share their concern – but would reiterate that the concern is much broader than that, and encompasses the broader business sector (and particularly the industrial energy users who feature in our client base and are members of organisations like the EUAA and the MEUG). It is critical that this energy transition is well managed – but we’ve been making a mess of it to date, for a range of different reasons . (C3) There are multiple factors at play It’s commonly noted that the National Electricity Market is a very complex integrated piece of machinery. What follows from this (though less often acknowledged) is that when there is a “failure” (or something that was too close to “failure” for comfort last week in NSW), it’s highly likely that there will multiple factors contributing to the predicament. Even a cursory analysis over the weekend reveals that there were challenges last week with coal, gas, wind, solar, hydro, interconnection capability, demand forecasting and so on… For those serious about learning from last week to help make the energy transition really work, then this would be a reasonable starting point. Unfortunately others seem to want to continue to play a different game… (C4) More distracting games on the Emotion-o-meter Sad to say that I’ve grown to expect the (potentially distracting) shouting match that seems to ramp up in volume at both extremes of the Emotion-o-meter whenever stressful times like these emerge. Despite the complexity (and associated near-certainty that multiple factors combine whenever there is “failure”), those at the extremes at the Emotion-o-meter seem to reduce everything to a single binary choice, based on a strongly held belief that “all of X is bad, and all of Y is good”, whatever those X and Y factors might be. That’s not getting us anywhere closer to a properly managed energy transition.",

That’s food for another post, at some other time…. Today it was a comment made by one of the speakers from TransGrid (I am not sure as there were several speakers) that had me power up NEMreview v7 this evening to have a quick look at some numbers on an annual average basis for demand in each region. The comment made was that demand in NSW has been increasing the past four years , and yet the AEMO’s forecasts are that the demand will continue to decline – hence there is a mismatch between expectation and reality . PS – Worth highlighting some feedback provided to me elsewhere that the AEMO forecasts for annual energy (i.e. the equivalent of average demand) show increases in NSW. I have not had time to check, but presume this means the TransGrid comment must have been with respect to peak demand perhaps? Given that I’d felt like one of the earlier ones to start noting that demand was declining in the NEM (which we saw in 2011 was occurring for reasons such as these ), I felt it important that I update my perspective – and share this here on WattClarity – lest we continue (again) with out-dated thinking. See here for the gory details of the different measures of demand shown, and about how it is even measured . I’ve other things to do this evening, so just have time to throw the following charts together, starting with NSW: These trends highlight what the speaker from TransGrid had noted – that there has been an increase the past couple years , albeit not at the same rate as the decline over the preceding period (or the incline of a decade ago). Moving north to Queensland, I was much more aware of how demand has grown in recent years, mainly on the back of up-stream compression of CSG for the LNG export trains: Further south, we note that Victorian demand appears to still be declining (unlike growth in NSW and QLD): This also appears to be the case in South Australia (noting also a bigger relative difference between the different measures of demand): Down in Tasmania, there seems to be a more variable pattern (even taking into account the depressed demand experienced due to the prolonged Bassslink outage through 2016 and hence unwanted demand response ): Summing it all together, we see a picture that (NEM-wide, on an annual average basis) electricity demand stopped declining after calendar 2014 , even taking into account the continuing rise of rooftop solar PV production which acts to reduce these measures of demand: Worth noting!",

    "date": "24-05-2018 01:14:00 PM",
    "content": "This morning over on Twitter , I was pulled into a discussion that had started with respect to volume of wind energy curtailed in South Australia : The genesis of this twitter conversation was the AEMO’s “Quarterly Energy Dynamics – Q1 2018” (which seems to be getting better each quarter as a core reference document). As noted in my tweet this morning, both of the links I mentioned (listed below for interested readers who want the back-story) need updating. Taking a bite at lunch I noticed that Giles had also posted on the same topic here today (Giles also mentions a report by Tilt Renewables which is probably one of the ones here, but I’ve not had time to check ), hence having a half hour at lunch I quickly threw the following chart together using my copy of NEMreview v7 : As noted at the bottom of the chart, the results have not been comprehensively checked (have to get back to my real job) – but clients can use what I have done as a starting point here and drill in for more details with their own licence to NEMreview (or ez2view at the higher end). Quick notes on the chart: 1) We see the stand-out effect of the wind drought of June 2017 ; 2) This was followed by a period through July/August/September of particularly strong wind harvest, with AEMO’s System Strength constraints kicking in from August and so constraining down output from there – most notably when winds were strong across the day, which makes sense. As noted in my tweet this morning: 2a) I did this analysis on 15th Sept 2017 of how much volume had been constrained ; and 2b) I posted on 17th Sept 2017 about why this was happening – with a bit of detail about how (though note that the specifics of the constraint has since changed). 3) I note that others had made the comment that the volume of constraint had reduced over time – but it seems clear from the chart above that this is (at least in part) because harvest volumes are lower. Often pays to go back to more granular data to double-check conclusions, and we can help with that through NEMreview . That’s all for today folks!",

    "content": "As of Thursday 10th May, AEMO has moved from a deterministic to a probabilistic method for forecasting the likelihood of Low Reserve Condition (LRC) over the forecast time horizon within MT PASA. In principle, this should mean a more precise modelling result – which should mean lower cost to the market, both in terms of: 1) more tailored market response to any forecast Low Reserve Condition at some point in the future; and also 2) more targeted procurement of emergency reserves (like through the RERT) if it is deemed that there is a “market failure” and that the AEMO needs to intervene. Of course, I have previously noted how forecasting is a difficult art (though I did not use those exact words) , so we will keenly watch to see what unfolds in practice. (A) Helping clients to understand MT PASA through our ez2view software Our ez2view clients (being ones with significant exposure to the market in some way – either as physical/financial traders, or in some other role) are also keenly interested in the new MT PASA data sets. We understand this, so we let them know earlier that we have been working down the path of upgrading our software to help them make the most of the opportunities apparent in the forecast runs – both currently, and as forecasts change through the weeks (or every 3 hours). This post will also help, as we know the battle of the full inbox. If you’re a client (or want to be) and would like to work with us in this discovery and development process, please give us a call on +61 7 3368 4064 . (B) Helping a broader audience make sense of the new MT PASA data We’re still undecided about how much we should be doing in this respect. I must admit to being more than a little disheartened by what seems to be a rapidly escalating tendency in the broader energy commentariat to misread (and it seems, at times, to wilfully misrepresent) the meaning of the data that was presented in the MT PASA data the AEMO used to publish. Contrary to what seems like popular belief in that respect, the primary purpose of AEMO’s forecasts (MT PASA and other) is and has always been to elicit a market response – not to promote cries of “the sky is falling”. We note that some of the new data sets & visualisations are not currently publicly available and we know that it’s an area of flux currently, so will take our time to think through anything we do publish more broadly. We have already incorporated some of the key data sets into the “Trend Engine” Widget within ez2view , and also available at ez2view online here: https://app.ez2view.info (clients can log in with their work email address) Some of the current data is shown here for a randomly selected region: You’ll note that I have masked some identifying details in the chart, in what is perhaps a fruitless effort to prevent certain sections of our readership (e.g. those at either ends of the Emotion-o-Meter ) from running off on their tangents.",

    "date": "18-05-2018 02:00:00 PM",
    "content": "This week, the sun has been very central to our thoughts for a number of reasons: 1) At least in part because of the different ways we’re helping a diverse range of people deal with the opportunities, and challenges, of solar PV in the broader NEM; 2) But also because Brisbane’s (almost) winter sunlit hours are magical in any case; 3) This Tuesday (15th May) was also an opportunity to be at the CEC’s well-attended “Large Solar Forum” (they have helpfully made the presentations publicly available here). Incidentally, nice to see a couple different references to ways we serve different clients in the slides. Prompted by questions received about the influx of new solar entrants into the space (which we’re tracking in our Generator Catalog ) we took at look at output over the week and share it here with you today: Note that NEMreview clients can access the Trend Template here, in order to see updated data and proceed to their own analysis. What immediately jumped out to me was the effect that these solar plants (and the much larger volume currently coming from aggregate small-scale rooftop PV) is having on the shape of pricing in these shoulder months. I’ve particularly highlighted Tuesday 15th May to note the irony that the CEC Forum heard of the 30 projects that Powerlink has at connection application stage followed by a much larger number at enquiry stage – and yet we’re already seeing the effect of a “Solar Correlation Penalty” . The way the high degree in correlation of solar output is suppressing spot prices through the day will pose some challenges for all generation sources that operate during those periods – including solar ones (both existing, and also this steady stream of new entrants). Coupled with this, the escalation in ramp rates required for dispatchable supply seen during the sunrise and sunset periods is also already (through the price spikes at these times in the chart above)sending pretty clear signals to the market of the type of investment required for the future. I’ve already written on WattClarity before about the increasing “Wind Correlation Penalty” driven by the high degree of correlation across all major operational wind farms in the NEM (currently spread across SA, VIC, TAS and NSW).

    "content": "In these days of an accelerating energy transition , we’re finding a diverse range of opportunities popping out of the woodwork. This morning I was meeting with a Director of a company we’re partnering with to assist small solar operators, when the conversation shifted to a more general reflection of the value of Dashboards for making what was once invisible, visible (and, if the design is right, easily understood). We have many dashboards – some standard, and some specifically developed for particular client purposes – but NEM-Watch is still one of our favourites even though it’s almost 19 years old (having gone through numerous iterations , with another one on the way). A display copy of NEM-Watch today alerted us to the low wind harvest occurring today right across the NEM – such as in this snapshot from 12:00 showing total wind production down below 200MW NEM wide: Now that (in and of itself) is actually not that remarkable – this sort of thing happens on a pretty regular basis, and I have posted before about the major need for more diversity in wind farm harvest (something that the current form of support for renewable generation does not really encourage). What has changed in the more recent months is that there has been an explosion in the numbers of new renewables projects under development (being catalogued in our Generator Catalog ). A couple of these are already up and running – including 2 wind farms in the Northern Tablelands of NSW (Sapphire Wind Farm, and White Rock Wind Farm). Now whilst these not be as far removed from the wind farms crowded into South Australia as those under development in Queensland, I had hoped to see their output would be materially different from those in South Australia. So using our NEMreview historical analysis software package, I selected a sample of wind farms, aiming for the ones that were as far apart as possible ‘as the crow flies’, and produced this time series trend over recent days: Given that there are a few of them, and the data is noisy, I have coloured them state colours to make them easier to read (clients can access an updated trend with more current data here ). Two things stand out to me: Conclusion 1) My expectation (perhaps based partly on what some renewables proponents had been telling me) had been that I would not have seen such an amazing, and somewhat scary, degree of alignment of output at these wind farms in SA and northern NSW over the past couple hours . This clearly indicates to me that we’re depending a lot on wind farms in Queensland to achieve a healthy diversity in wind farm harvest as the numbers grow. Conclusion 2) Adding together the two numbers for wind farms in Tasmania (with Musselroe being the highest) gives something over 150MW – which also equates pretty closely to the numbers seen NEM wide. What this implies (and I have confirmed offline) is that all the wind farms currently across the mainland NEM are contributing, in aggregate, less than 50MW . As an integrated energy sector, we are going to have to do much, much better in the future (than we have done in the past) if we are going to have a chance of getting where we need to go …",

    "title": "Network outage, and low wind, combine to drive spot price volatility in the SA region on Thursday 26th April",
    "date": "26-04-2018 03:12:00 PM",
    "content": "A brief post today, to follow the earlier two tweets this afternoon, and because we might come back and revisit this day at a later point in time. In the first of the tweets , I posted this snapshot from our NEM-Watch v10 dashboard to illustrate the 11:40 dispatch interval where the spot price had jumped up to the Market Price Cap (MPC) of $14,200/MWh: This was the third dispatch interval in a row that had seen price at that level – we’d seen the price spike first for the 11:30 dispatch interval, following from the trip of a major transmission line and substation in the south-eastern part of South Australia, which removed the capacity of importing lower-priced electricity from Victoria into South Australia. Given it was a period of low (and dropping) wind today in South Australia, South Australia had been importing from Victoria to keep prices low. The loss of the interconnector required peaking capacity in South Australia to ramp up leading to the price spiking. Given the small number of generators in the state that own dispatchable capacity (thermal generators and batteries) this has led to a situation of high prices through the afternoon (overlaid with the see-saw outcomes resulting from the 5/30 issue, which is with us out till 1st July 2021). Here’s a Web-based Trend Chart from ez2view that shows the past week, and a forecast week into the future for the South Australian region, but remember that clients can access the live updating version of this here : That’s all I have time for at this point…",

    "title": "An explainer about electricity demand [take 1]",
    "date": "24-04-2018 10:49:00 AM",
    "content": "Frequent readers will have noticed our enduring interest in electricity demand at WattClarity (including, importantly, the various measures for it). In some prior years we have given away a BBQ for the “best demand forecaster in the NEM” , but (more seriously) we recognise that the shape and nature of electricity demand is one of the most significant contributors to price outcomes in the wholesale market – which affect all energy users (directly or indirectly). (a) In past years the focus might have been primarily on peak demand, (b) and to a lesser extent load factor – (c) whereas with the snowballing energy transition , we’re entering an environment where other parameters (such as the rate of change in demand) are going to be increasingly important. Since 2000, when our company started, we have received a large number of questions about electricity demand – how it’s measured, the different metrics, what it all means, and so on… The rate of these questions has even been increasing in recent times. In the interests of better answering these questions (including for those who have not yet asked) we’re posting this article in our “Energy Literacy” section of the WattClarity energy sector insight and commentary service. About “Take 1” of this explainer This edition of an explainer about electricity demand (posted in April 2018) is the first of what might end up being several iterations, spaced over time, with each successive iteration refined with the help of feedback from readers such as yourself – particularly in relation to: (a) Any factual errors made in the following; and (b) Importantly , the extent to which this helps you understand the data provided through our various products, such as in the Live Supply & Demand Widget we are please to provide with the support of RenewEconomy . We thank those who have provided input already, but make it clear that any errors (and other shortcomings) are entirely our fault. With that in mind, we hope you will find the following useful: (A) The difference between a MW and a MWh [PS in October 2022 we lifted out this initial part from this article and copied it over to a stand-alone article ‘Analytical challenge (or beginner mistake!) – understanding the difference between a MW and a MWh’ here ] Given the number of times we’ve seen people confused about this over the years, we thought we’d start by explaining the difference between the two fundamental metrics: 1) a megawatt-hour (MWh), which is a measure of volume/quantity ; and 2) megawatt (MW), which is a rate (or a volume over a time) . To help readers visualise the difference, we’ve included the following animated image showing the analogy of flow into a bucket of water: Image #1 – A megawatt measures the rate of energy supply (or consumption) Does this help to clarify the difference? . (B) Different measures of rate, and volume, of energy delivered/consumed Since 2000 we’ve been striving to make the energy sector more understandable to a diverse range of people. This has been primarily in Australia’s National Electricity Market – but has also been in a range of other locations. Across the world there are a couple different units used to describe the same volume of energy, summed up in the following table: Table 1 – different units of measurement Measures of volume/quantity Measures of rate 1MWh 1 MWh = 1,000,000Wh The “watt-hour” (symbolised Wh) is a unit of energy commonly used in the electricity sector. 1MW A megawatt is the rate at which energy would need to be supplied/consumed on average over an hour to deliver/consume a quantity of 1MWh. 3,600MJ 1MWh of energy is the same quantity as 3,600MJ (or 3.6GJ) 3.6GJ = 3,600MJ = 3,600,000,000J = 1,000,000Wh = 1MWh The “joule” is the SI unit (i.e. International System of Unit) used across many countries for energy more broadly (i.e. not so much in describing electricity). 3,600 MJ/h A rate of 1MW is equivalent to 3,600MJ/h (just expressed in different units). 3,600MJ/h = 3,600,000,000 J/h = 1,000,000J/s = 1,000,000W = 1MJ/s = 1MW In SI units, it is more common to see rates of energy expressed in “joules per second”. One watt is just an energy delivery/consumption rate of one joule per second. ~3. 4MMBtu 1MWh of energy is the same quantity as 3,412,141 Btu The Btu (British thermal unit) is used in a number of countries for energy more broadly where they do not follow the SI units– most notably including the USA. An added point of confusion here is that the “M” in this unit represents the Roman Numeral “M” (i.e. 1000) and not the more widely used descriptor of 1 million (i.e. 1,000,000) with SI units. ~3.4MMBtu/h 1MW of energy is the same rate as 3,412,141 Btu per hour Please do point out any errors I have made in the table above. . (C) Understanding the difference between Dispatch, and Settlement Using terminology that’s specific for the NEM (but which has underlying parallels in most other locations) it’s important to understand that there are a number of different time frames relevant to measuring how much electricity is produced, or consumed: #1) real-time operations (which includes Dispatch) and #2) after-the-fact Settlement. Different data sources are used in real-time operations than in settlement, for a number of reasons (including cost and complexity). This is illustrated as follows: Image #2 – Dispatch works differently than Settlement Currently we (as a company) are focused specifically on real-time operations (i.e. revolving around dispatch, and planning for dispatch), and the different types of visualisation tools we provide (including the numbers they quote/publish) are published with respect to the real-time operations paradigm. . (D) Especially in real time, “demand” is measured at the supply-side end To an outsider it would seem logical that, to measure electricity demand in certain location, one would take all of the individual electricity meters at each customer connection point and add them up. However from a macro perspective (i.e. for a whole region/state/province) that’s proved to not be the most effective, or efficient mechanism for doing this (partly because of the delay in accessing settlement data, noted above). Rather, because electricity must be produced at exactly the same rate it’s being consumed instantaneously, we can start from the supply end and work downwards – knowing that the rate of energy addition at the supply-side end will match, in real time, the rate of energy consumption at the demand-side end. This is illustrated in the following image: Image #3 – Measuring Supply, as a proxy for Demand For those who want to know more here’s two other resources: (1) In March 2017 one of our guest authors (Jonathan Dyson) put together this 2017 explainer on about the role of the FCAS market in keeping the system frequency close to 50Hz (with several more detailed articles on system frequency, and FCAS in particular, also here). (2) For a more detailed view of the electricity supply chain we periodically update the detailed “Power Supply Schematic” wall chart, to illustrate the various organisations involved in connecting the supply side and the demand side of the electricity sector . . (E) However there are complexities… In the 3 rd image above, we represent what would be effectively a totally closed system, where 100% of what is supplied at one end is consumed at the other end (which assumes, of course, linear flow path). As always, reality turns out to be more complicated than simple models. As I have noted before – any model’s just a model, it’s not reality – though they can be useful sometimes (I hope the simplistic model above has helped some users). There are many complications involved in measuring rate of supply at one end as a proxy for the rate of consumption – though it remains (at least for now) the best method available. We’ll list some of the complexities here, but note that it is not a comprehensive list: Complexity E1) Dealing with interconnector flow The model above assumes there is just one “zone” within the grid or market that’s in focus – but this is very seldom the case: 1) Looking at the entirety of demand across the whole NEM would be one such rare instance, but at WattClarity we seem to be one of the few who do this. The vast majority of AEMO metrics relate to supply and demand in particular regions; 2) In the more interconnected electricity grids (across North America, Europe and parts of Asia, for instance) there are always the effects of interconnector flows that need to be taken in consideration – both in terms of raw energy flows, but also in terms of ability to share reserves and so on (though that’s something best reserved to a different article). Continuing the bathtub analogy, we can see how the rate of energy transfer across interconnectors needs to be taken into account to calculate the rate of electricity consumption in all regions. Image #4 – Calculating Demand by including flow across Zonal Boundaries The network topology across the NEM can be described in terms of interconnections between a number of different zones: 1) Our ez2view software describes supply and demand in terms of 27 zones across the NEM, and includes (optional) access to live inter-zonal flows within some regions, and live zonal demand; 2) The rules of the NEM currently provide for 5 regions, which are a special form of zone that supports region-level pricing outcomes; 3) The RenewEconomy-sponsored NEMwatch Supply & Demand widget currently utilises these 5 regions and adds in the “South-West Interconnected System (SWIS)” of Western Australia to show supply and demand for 6 zones in total (5 of which are interconnected). Our other products also deal with demand at a regional level, and hence the effect of interconnector flows. Complexity E2) The supply chain is not linear Our simple model above also assumes that generators are large and centralised – being conceptually located at one end of the “supply chain”, with consumption occurring wholly at the other end. In reality this is not the case. It never has been, but the significance of this simplifying assumption is becoming more important with the rise of distributed energy resources. What follows are three specific examples of how reality is more complex than this simplistic model – but note, again, that even these three examples don’t address all of the complexities involved . Example E2a) The rise of distributed solar PV Australia, moreso than any other location we know of across the world, has seen an exceptional uptake of distributed solar PV capacity. This has been driven by a confluence of environmental advantages, commercial considerations, and government policy. Whilst the growth has been subject to its own idiosyncrasies , the net result is that distributed PV provides a significant contribution to electricity supplies. This is not without its own challenges from a measurement and management point of view ( as discussed before ). In the following image, we explain how this makes it more difficult to understand the rate of total electricity consumption: Image #5 – The opacity of Embedded Solar PV brings with it a growing challenge of understanding total consumption It’s important that readers understand that, whether the objective is to understand the rate of total consumption, or the requirements for upstream supply, it does not matter whether energy from rooftop PV is totally consumed at the home, or whether some spills onto the local network to be consumed at neighbouring homes. From the perspective of the upstream high voltage grid, this embedded energy production simply reduces the demand to be met from centralised large supply sources. From the perspective of total consumption, all the production from rooftop PV plus all supply from the wider grid get added together. From the perspective of the market operator (AEMO, in the case of Australia) these injections of electricity from rooftop PV are effectively “invisible” and their real time (supply-side) measurements of “demand” are correspondingly lower than total consumption. However this reduced demand is the appropriate level for the market operator to use in scheduling delivery from large scale sources. In our Supply & Demand Widget, we address this difference between large scale supply and total consumption by showing the estimated injections from small-scale PV in terms of both supply and demand within each region: Image #6 – Ensuring the numbers add up by ensuring estimated supply from small-scale PV is shown on both the supply side and the demand side This is something we must do, for the numbers to add up. Readers should be aware that the numbers published by the APVI have a number of imperfections which result in the numbers being different than what is actually happening – with some factors suggesting under-estimation, whilst other factors suggesting over-estimation ( as discussed before ). That should not be read as a negative on the APVI and their method – every forecast contains imperfections (as noted before ) Example E2b) Other embedded generation Embedded solar PV is not the only example of cases where embedded generation (that’s invisible to the market operator in real time) leads to an underestimated level of total electricity consumption. For decades, a number of commercial and industrial sites have utilised embedded generation facilities in order to supply a portion of their own consumption on site. Most of this has been (and remains) invisible to the market operator in real time: Image #7 – Embedded Generation at Commercial & Industrial sites has long been invisible to the market operator in real time While estimates of annual levels of energy produced by some of this embedded generation exist, unfortunately we have not (to this point) identified a way in which we could include some measure of this C&I self-generation to deliver a more accurate picture of real-time Supply & Demand in the Widget. Image #8 – The effect of other embedded generation can’t currently be shown in the Widget Example E2c) Auxiliary Energy Usage The complications for our simple model don’t end with generation that we can’t see in real time, however. There’s also a matter that most generation plant self-consume some of the electricity that they generate before it’s exported to the grid: Image #9 – Self-Consumption of “Auxiliary Energy” at Generation Sites All generators self-consume a small amount of energy before its exported to the grid: (a) In some cases, like solar and wind, the self-consumption is so small as to be negligible (b) Generation involving a steam cycle (i.e. boiling pressurised water to spin a turbine) require a non-trivial amount of auxiliary energy in order to power the pumps and motors required for water and air flow, etc… To explain the difference between the two numbers, the industry commonly uses the following terms: Table 2 – Different terminology used with respect to supply/demand “As Generated” The measure that represents the total production of electricity at a particular generator, before accounting for Auxiliary Energy usage This is sometimes also referred to as “At the Generator Terminals” or “Gross”. “Auxiliary Energy” A measure of how much energy is consumed on the generator site before it leaves the station “gate”. “Auxiliary Factor” The percentage of energy rate (or volume) self-consumed as Auxiliary Energy, relative to the As-Generated energy rate (or volume). It’s important to note that (in the NEM, as in many markets) a generator’s Auxiliary Factor is confidential to that particular participant. Our NEMreview product utilises an in-built Generator Catalog containing estimates for Auxiliary Factors for the NEM stations for which the AEMO publishes data. We are in the process of expanding and enhancing this Generator Catalog such that: 1) It can be utilised in our other products; and 2) Such that it can be accessed directly , by those who just wish to subscribe to this service. “Sent-Out Energy” “Sent-Out Energy” is the rate/volume of electrical energy that makes its way onto the grid at the generator’s connection point “at the station gate”. Hence, if we’re talking rate of production, then Rate of Generation Sent-Out (in MW) = Rate of Generation As-Generated (in MW) – Rate of Auxiliary Energy Usage Internally (in MW) Hence, if we’re talking volume of production, then Volume of Generation Sent-Out (in MWh) = Volume of Generation As-Generated (in MWh) – Volume of Auxiliary Energy Usage Internally (in MWh) As with the Auxiliary Factor, the Sent-Out Energy (rate/volume) is confidential to the market participant. This is just the same as an individual energy user’s rate/volume of consumption being confidential to them. Remembering the distinction between Dispatch and Settlement (section C above) it is important to understand that · the NEM is dispatched on an As-Generated basis ; whereas · the NEM is settled on a Sent-Out basis . This means that any figure quoted for rate of electricity consumption (i.e. demand) is highly likely to be on an As-Generated basis – though we note that the AEMO has started to use Sent-Out basis in some instances, like with the consumption and demand forecasts in the 2017 Electricity Forecasting Insights (see footnote 1 on p3) to keep everyone on their toes . . Complexity E3) There is energy “lost” in the supply chain We wanted to highlight a third area of complexity (noting that there are more than these three ) that has to do with energy being “lost” through the transmission and distribution grid, on the way to its final point of consumption. Now the first point to note is that calling this energy “lost” is not meant to imply that we don’t know where it’s gone. A high proportion of the energy “lost” is converted to heat in the transmission and distribution networks. Rather, we use the term “energy lost” to imply that it a percentage of the energy generated does not get to do “useful work” at the energy user’s site, because it is used up in the process of delivering it to that end. Image #10 – Energy “Losses” enroute to final consumption Losses are typically a function of factors like the size of the conductor, the voltage, and the distance over which it travels. Reducing losses is one of the main reasons why high voltages are used in delivering electricity over long distances (like using high pressure in pumping fluids over long distances in pipes). Again, from the point of the Supply & Demand Widget (and remembering that the NEM is dispatched on an “As-Generated basis” we see that the energy “lost” in delivery forms a component of the total demand number . Complexity E4) Time-points associated with the data Based on questions we’ve been asked over the years, and clarifications we’ve needed to make in relation to our products (particularly the very widely consumed NEMwatch Widget on RenewEconomy ), we know we need to add in some clarification of the different time points that apply in relation to data published by the AEMO (and others, like the TNSPs through ez2view ). One of AEMO’s key tasks is to schedule the dispatch of large scale, controllable supply and demand sources. “Scheduling dispatch” means to send each of these sources, at regular intervals, individual production/consumption target levels that in aggregate meet the demand level that AEMO sees (“scheduled demand”), and are consistent with the market offers made by each source. In the NEM this happens on a 5-minute “look-ahead” (“ex-ante”) basis. AEMO must forecast where demand will be in 5 minutes and schedule the market accordingly. To do this AEMO uses real-time supply-side measurements from operational SCADA metering to calculate current demand, so that the only true forecast required is the change in demand over the next 5 minutes. This gives rise to a difference between metered and target measures of demand. Metered (or Initial) demand is what’s measured using SCADA metering at the start of every 5-minute dispatch interval, while Target demand is the forecast level at the end of the same interval. In a perfect world, one dispatch interval’s Target demand would be the next interval’s Metered demand, but even over 5 minutes there can be significant deviations away from forecasts (one of the reasons that FCAS services are needed to keep things in balance). Table 3 – Understanding the time points associated with the data Metered Target Dispatch Through their MMS, the AEMO publishes a number of measures that are metered numbers taken at the start of each dispatch interval. These measures include Initial Supply (for a region), and Initial MW (for relevant generators). It is the Initial MW numbers that we use heavily in the NEMwatch Widget for a number of reasons, including: 1) Initial MW is available in real time, whereas other metrics (such as Dispatch Targets) and deemed confidential in real time and only published on a next day basis. 2) Data is also supplied for Initial MW for a greater range of generators (including some that are not scheduled, so do not receive dispatch instructions from the AEMO). Hence using these provides a broader visibility of the fuel type mix supplying the NEM (though there has been some confusion so caused because the AEMO’s data dashboard currently provides data for only a smaller list of generators). The NEM is dispatched on a 5 minute basis and (until 1st July 2021) settled on a half-hour basis. Targets are effectively forecasts made, at the start of the (5-min) dispatch interval, for the rate expected at the end of the dispatch interval – such as: 1) the rate of production of expected from each scheduled DUID (or consumption, for scheduled loads); 2) the rate of consumption (i.e. demand) which AEMO forecasts on behalf of all non-scheduled loads; and 3) the expectation of how the interconnectors will be flowing at that time, to keep supply and demand balanced. The Dispatch Demand Target for each region was one of the few metrics available back when the NEM started. At that time, there was a singular focus on Scheduled Demand, as well. It remains one of the key metrics, as it has a direct bearing on what the price outcomes are for the dispatch interval. For instance, in our “Best demand forecaster in the NEM” competition which we have run for a number of years, we tend to focus on the “Scheduled Demand” Dispatch Target in order to maintain a direct connection with the basis of the prior year results. Trading (until 1 July 2021, when the NEM moves to 5-minute settlement) When the AEMO issues reports on new peaks in electricity demand (which tends to be each summer and winter), they tend to do this on the basis of metered data for a half hour . Because dispatch works on a five minute basis, there is no real need for target values to be provided on a half-hour basis. In some respects (such as generation production) a time-weighted average might still be credible – however in other cases (such as with respect to transmission limits), a half-hourly average of 6 x 5-minute limit numbers does not make a whole lot of sense. . (F) Some other terminology used to describe Demand As you’ll see from the above, the simplistic model that I started by drawing needs to be layered with different types of complexities in order to arrive at something better reflecting reality. Table 4 – Three difference definitions of demand used by AEMO, plus one we’ll be using more often A layperson’s idea of “rate of aggregate consumption supplied from all sources” It may surprise some readers that there is not even terminology defined to describe what a layperson might think of as “rate of aggregate consumption supplied from all sources”. We know of some industry participants who refer to this as “Native Consumption” to differentiate it from AEMO’s term “Native Demand” (below) – but it is highly likely that there are other terms also in use to describe the same thing. In particular, note that “Native Demand” (i.e. AEMO’s term) excludes both: 1) Supplies from generation sources smaller than 1MW (which means all of the rooftop solar that’s producing across the NEM); and 2) Some non-scheduled (embedded) generation sources larger than 1MW, but for which AEMO and the Jurisdictional Planning Bodies don’t have sufficient data. We believe that this would mean lack of visibility of: (2a) solar PV greater than 1MW but still too small to have metered generation available on a individual facility basis (such as Valdora on the Sunshine Coast, Peterborough in SA , and a rapidly growing list). (2b) a number of back-up gensets at commercial and industrial facilities (which might rarely run); along with (2c) some of the electricity generation embedded within industrial processes that runs more frequently. It’s this data “missing” from AEMO’s Native Demand numbers that is the reason why others try to create their own view of “Native Consumption” – it’s also why we try to do the same in our Supply & Demand widget , notwithstanding that we know the picture is incomplete because of missing data about various electricity supply sources, such as: 1) solar production at the growing number of medium-scale facilities above the 100kW SRES cut-off, but below the (at least 5MW) level where the AEMO will take an interest in accessing meter data in real time; and 2) the large number of embedded generation facilities installed in commercial and industrial sites across the NEM. AEMO term “Native Demand” AEMO defines here the term “Native Demand” as follows: For a number of reasons (included those alluded to above) it is not practical to calculate, in real time, a 100% accurate picture about the magnitude of Native Demand. For practical reasons, the AEMO chooses to focus much more on Operational Demand (below). AEMO term “Operational Demand” Increasingly as this energy transition picks up pace, the AEMO is using “Operational Demand” as the metric they speak about in more public forums. AEMO defines here the term “Operational Demand” as follows: I think about “Operational Demand” as “Demand the AEMO can see” – which includes Scheduled Demand (below) but also demand met by larger scale intermittent (but non- scheduled) generators that they can “see” because they have access to SCADA generation data in real time. The AEMO MMS data field “Demand and Non-Scheduled Generation” most closely matches their definition of “Operational Demand” in real time: 1) It’s this data that is shown in our “ECA Widget” , for instance; 2) But we should not that it does not perfectly equate to “Operational Demand” – which is the reason why we have calculated it ourselves from raw unit-level data in the “RenewEconomy widget” . This also enables us to explicitly show electricity demand used to charge storage – either in the form of: 2a) Electricity stored in batteries – as shown here: Image #11 – Energy storage to battery 2b) Electricity converted to potential energy in pumped storage hydro facilities – as shown here: Image #12 – Energy storage to pumped hydro Separately, the AEMO publishes an Operational Demand metric on a half-hourly basis, and we include this as an additional data series for each region in NEMreview v7 . AEMO term “Scheduled Demand” AEMO defines here the term “Scheduled Demand” as follows: When the NEM started back at the end of 1998, this was the only measure of demand that existed. “Scheduled Demand” is still a centrally important metric within the NEM – as it is the demand against which AEMO dispatches controllable sources in order to balance the system and to clear the electricity spot market. In other words, it produces the prices we all pay . We just need to keep in mind that Scheduled Demand is Our term “Demand met by fully dispatchable supply” This is a bit of a long-winded term, but one we will be using increasingly in future – as it represents one of the challenges the NEM (and most other grids) will have to manage increasingly in future. It subtracts from Scheduled Demand the contribution of sources that are not fully controllable – the so called “Semi-Scheduled” large scale wind and solar PV generators, which can reduce output if requested by AEMO, but whose maximum output fluctuates with wind and sunlight conditions. When I spoke at All Energy in 2015, presenting some analysis of what the NEM would look like with a 10x increase in intermittent supplies, I used the term “Energy Unserved by Wind and Solar” to describe this metric . . (G) Some other light reading… For those who are seeking more of the gory details, the AEMO has produced a number of useful reference guides over the Table 5 – other references you might like to read, about electricity demand Sometime 2016 The AEMO also published a short explanation of what they mean by “operational” which we found of use. Here’s a version of this document we saved ourselves sometime during 2016 . Sept 2016 This AEMO document “Demand Terms in EMMS Data Model” from September 2016 can help. It’s a document that has been through a number of revisions over the years. I find v7 from Sept 2016 much clearer than some prior issues. Please note that any errors made in translating from these more “industry-speak” documents to something that hopefully is more widely understandable above are entirely mine. I would be delighted if you could point out any errors I have made , along with anything you think I could clarify even further – either in comments below, or direct with me (please call +61 7 3368 4064 or drop us a line). Just note that I might be slow to respond, given the diverse nature of customer demands on our business. . (H) A different view of Electricity Demand (another Widget) The Supply & Demand Widget, which we provide with the sponsorship of RenewEconomy, is one of our widgets that we’re pleased to provide freely accessible on the web, with the help of our sponsors. We have another widget that is consumption-focused, so is worth mentioning here. In mid-2016 we were pleased to be able to introduce this geographical view of Operational Demand in “the ECA Widget” and how it relates to local temperatures at population centres across the country: Image #13 – The ECA Widget, which you can also find here and here and other locations as well (and are able to embed on your own website too) . (I) Seeking your feedback on this explainer Thanks for making your way all the way to the bottom of this article – we realise that it’s a fair bit normal than a typical blog post. But (at least for us) the topic of electricity demand is an important one, and we see that it will become increasingly important into the future as this energy transition gathers pace. For that reason, we’re keen on your feedback in terms of how helpful you found this (and in particular any errors you have seen in the above): Option 1 = if you’re happy to have your comments visible to all readers (some of whom might also help answer any questions you have), please just leave a question or comment below the article.

    "title": "When the NEM’s Largest Generating Unit Trips …",
    "date": "20-04-2018 04:11:00 PM",
    "content": "A quick followup from my post a few weeks ago on FCAS in action after the trip of a Loy Yang A unit. On Wednesday evening this week the largest single generating unit in the NEM, the 750 MW Kogan Creek generator in Queensland, tripped from full load at 8:28 pm: How did the power system cope? With the AEMO 4-second SCADA dataset released this morning, we can quickly look at the impacts on system frequency and the responses from other generators around the NEM, summarised in this chart: Compared to the Loy Yang A trip covered in my earlier post , this was a larger unit losing output much more quickly – essentially inside one 4-second interval on the AEMO dataset. As a result the system frequency fell more rapidly and deeply, well below the lower operational frequency threshold of 49.85 Hz, the lowest value recorded in this data being 49.61 Hz. Nevertheless, the frequency fall was quickly arrested and then gradually recovered thanks to generator responses from right around the NEM, and quite possibly also responses from demand side FCAS providers who unfortunately don’t show up in the AEMO dataset. The damped oscillations in frequency and in generator response are interesting, and weren’t evident in the “more graceful” trip of LYA3 previously covered, which took about 20-30 seconds to lose full output. These probably reflect the more rapid initial shock to frequency and are physically a bit like the reverberations of a struck bell (although much slower). Finally, it’s worth looking at responses from a few individual generators around the NEM. First the relatively nearby Gladstone, also in Queensland: Then at the other end of the system, Torrens Island B in South Australia: And because everyone’s always interested, the big battery (Hornsdale Power Reserve) in South Australia: – remarkably precise responses to movements in frequency, reinforcing some of AEMO’s observations in its recent report on the the battery’s operation .

    "title": "Renewable energy – did it just laze about over summer?",
    "date": "27-03-2018 02:14:00 PM",
    "content": "In reading some of the panic-stricken media commentary about the impending blackouts we were supposed to have this summer, you might have been led to believe that renewable energy doesn’t contribute much at all to ensuring the lights stayed on. If it ain’t baseload then it isn’t any good. The implication is that we therefore we can’t really reduce Australia’s carbon emissions unless we’re prepared to accept regular blackouts or nuclear power. Unfortunately, it seems our political debate about how we ensure reliable supplies of electricity has been boiled down to some simplistic yes-no question about whether it is “baseload”. We may even have a policy imposed upon our energy market that will separate powers sources into one of two categories – dispatchable or not dispatchable. If you’re dispatchable then you contribute to a “reliability guarantee”, otherwise you’re out. But typically the world is a bit more complicated than something that can be boiled down to a simple yes-no question. While this may come as a surprise to some politicians and media commentators, electricity demand is not constant across all times of the day. Most of the time we’ve got more than enough electricity generating capacity to go around, particularly at night time. The times when demand can get so high as to stretch our available supplies tend to be when businesses are operating and we’re up and about and it’s particularly hot. That co-incidentally happens to be when the sun is out and at intense levels. Also, it is true that the amount of wind does vary quite a lot – does this mean this source of energy is next to useless? Green Energy Markets in our recent February edition of the Renewable Energy Index thought it worthwhile to review how much power we received from renewable energy over summer to see whether it was as useless as some political and media commentators might suggest. No surprises that black coal was by far the most dominant source of electricity over summer, just as it is across the rest of the year. However, the second largest source of electricity across the main grids of the NEM and South-West Interconnected System was zero emission renewables with 9,880GWh. It was 8% greater than brown coal and 40% more than gas. In case you were wondering, power from oil-based fuels such as diesel were negligible, contrary to suggestions from our energy minister Josh Frydenberg that we had to resort to some huge amounts of pollutant spewing diesel generators to keep the lights on. Total generation from renewable energy, brown coal, gas and oil over Dec 2017-Feb-2018 across the NEM and SWIS Sources: NEM Review v6 , AEMO, and Green Energy Markets estimates of non-AEMO metered renewable energy generators. But this actually undersells the importance of renewable energy to reliability because it delivered most of its electricity during the periods when demand for power was highest. Over last summer in the NEM, electricity demand was at its highest over the period of 10:30AM to 6:30PM. After 6:30PM power demand was almost always lower than the half hour of 10:30AM-11AM, and it certainly was lower on the days when we had the highest electricity demand. The chart below details the average amount of power received during each of the hours in the 10:30AM-6:30PM period across the months of December, January and February by fuel type. Please note that the way I’ve labelled the charts is such that 11AM in the chart below and in subsequent charts denotes an average of the power supplied between 10:30AM and 11:30AM and likewise 6PM denotes the average of power across 5:30PM to 6:30PM. Average generation in NEM from renewable energy compared to brown coal and gas by time of day and month Source: NEM Review v6 The sceptics amongst you might justifiably say, “sure that might be the averages but they can smooth over the sins within the sample of renewable energy’s intermittency”. So let’s instead look at the specific 40 individual half hour periods over summer that represent the highest system-wide demand, instead. These actually show renewable energy producing more power than what we see in the averages, which is partly a function of the fact that system demand reaches its highest point when the sun is beating down. NEM output from renewables, brown coal and gas in the top 40 highest half hour demand periods over summer Source: NEM Review v6 It is important to acknowledge that hydro (a dispatchable technology) does play an important part in these figures. To understand its role relative to wind and solar (unfortunately AEMO doesn’t meter most of the bioenergy plants) let’s delve down into the three highest demand days over summer, looking at the half hour periods of time when demand exceeded 32,000MW. The chart below represents the period when NEM system demand reached its highest point over summer which was 19 December. Demand went over 32,000MW in the period ending 11:30AM and subsided below that level after 5PM. Wind output was quite solid at that time, with wind farms producing about 55% to 60% of their rated capacity across the entire period. Solar PV produced above 3000MW until 2:30, and as it dropped around 3PM hydro generation lifted. Renewable generation by fuel compared to gas and brown coal by 30 minute interval on the highest NEM demand period last summer (19 Dec) Source: NEM Review v6 The next highest demand day was on 19 January when demand was above 32,000MW from 11AM until 5:30PM. Wind output wasn’t nearly as high on that day at between 802MW to 1,344MW or 16% to 28% of the installed capacity. Is that useless? Well it was about 97% of the output produced by Liddell Power Station over the same time period. Solar meanwhile had a very good day – punching out an average of just over 4,000MW to 2:30PM. Again, as it dropped away in the afternoon, hydro output came up, and produced an average of 4,756MW from 2:30PM to 5PM. Renewable generation by fuel compared to gas and brown coal by 30 minute interval on the second highest NEM demand period last summer (19 Jan). Source: NEM Review v6 On the third highest demand day –22 January – wind output began at 1,057MW as demand clocked over 32,000MW in the 30 minute period preceding 1PM (13:00). It then steadily rose to 1,446MW before demand subsided below 32,000MW after 5PM. Solar output was substantial but not as high as 19 January – providing 3,642MW in the period ending 1PM and remaining above 3000MW until 3PM. Hydro again lifted in the afternoon, and provided an average of almost 3,300MW across the period that demand was above 32,000MW. Renewable generation by fuel compared to gas and brown coal by 30 minute interval on the third highest NEM demand period last summer (22 Jan). Source: NEM Review v6 So what are the implications of this analysis? Clearly, renewables are making an important contribution to meeting peak demand and therefore addressing reliability. Yes, it is indisputable that the ability to control the dispatch of hydro plant independent of short-term weather events is vitally important – particularly to meeting demand peaks in the late afternoon and early evening. But solar output’s high correlation with weather events that drive peaks in demand makes it also very valuable. Wind output isn’t nearly as well aligned with peaks in demand, but it is hardly useless. The chart below details the proportion of wind installed capacity that was generating during the top 50 half hour demand intervals over last summer. For 45 of these 50 intervals wind produced 18% or more of its rated capacity, for half of the intervals it was greater than 41%. Suggestions wind power doesn’t make any useful contribution to meeting peak demand seem to ignore this. Proportion of NEM wind power’s installed capacity generating electricity during the top 50 half hour demand intervals over last summer. Source: NEM Review v6 In considering the design of the National Energy Guarantee it’s important to note that there is more to ensuring reliability than a simplistic evaluation of whether or not a power generator has dispatchable capacity. The current energy-only market design for the NEM provides a vastly more sophisticated set of incentives for delivering capacity when its required than a central planner can manage. Critically, the incentives are dynamic, responding every five minutes to changes in the supply-demand balance. There are an incredible array of options available to us to reduce electricity emissions while also ensuring reliable electricity supplies. This will require a sophisticated mixing and matching of different technologies and balancing of statistical probabilities. Controllable dispatchable capacity will clearly be important in balancing out the variability of wind and solar. But at the same time, the geographical spacing of wind and solar will also help, as will greater transmission interconnection. We may also see consumers shift their demand into the midday period to take advantage of high solar output at this time. Further gains in low wind speed turbine technology may also result in less variability in wind farms’ output. Such a complex array of decisions are best left to market participants, not Barnaby Joyce or Craig Kelly, not Malcolm Turnbull or Bill Shorten, and not even AEMO head Audrey Zibelman.

    "title": "FCAS in Action – What Happens When a Generator Trips? (or Never let the data get in the way of a good story)",
    "date": "27-03-2018 12:58:00 PM",
    "content": "I was puzzled late last year when a bit of hype emerged about the performance of South Australia’s “Big Battery” (Hornsdale Power Reserve) following the trip of a large coal-fired unit in Victoria early on the morning of December 14 th . An article appeared on the Reneweconomy energy news site which might have been read as crediting the “ millisecond response ” of the battery for saving the grid from some sort of catastrophe, and contrasting this with the slower response of “ the generator contracted at that time to provide FCAS (frequency control and ancillary services), the Gladstone coal generator in Queensland ”. A few things here just didn’t sound right. For a start, at any one instant there are always many generators enabled in the NEM to provide FCAS – services which come in eight different flavours, from second-to-second frequency regulation , through to delayed-reaction contingency response over timeframes of up to five minutes, as explained in Jonathon Dyson’s excellent WattClarity articles on FCAS. So focusing on what Gladstone did or didn’t do clearly couldn’t tell the whole story. And whatever the speed of HPR’s response, being a much smaller facility (100 MW) than the tripped Loy Yang A unit 3 (560 MW) it was never going to be able to stabilise system frequency all by itself. That requires replacing essentially all the tripped unit’s lost power output with increased output from other sources. At the time I was busy with other stuff and thought I’d go back and have a closer look a little later. Or a lot later as it turns out. A chart in the original Reneweconomy article showed the timing of events with the Loy Yang A unit’s output falling away, and a sudden injection of power from the battery (HPR): Source: Reneweconomy, 19 Dec 2017 Looks impressive, but a closer glance at the scaling of the chart shows that the maximum injection of power from HPR was less than one sixtieth of what was lost when Loy Yang A3 tripped. If we use a common scale for both facilities then the picture is a little different: But for at least some Reneweconomy readers– see the voluminous comments thread under the article – this was unimportant detail and it was the speed of that response that must have been decisive. After all, according to the article “ by the time that the contracted Gladstone coal unit had gotten out of bed and put its socks on so it can inject more into the grid – it is paid to respond in six seconds – the fall in frequency had already been arrested and was being reversed ”. Now, speed of response is a factor in response to contingencies but it’s far from being the only one. To be fair, a subsequent update to the article makes it clear that there was never an intention to suggest that the response of the battery “ averted a blackout ”, and that the author’s point was to show “ what Tesla could do ”. But to see all this in better context, the point of this post is to show what the system as a whole does when a large generating unit trips, covering the response of a broad set of generators. Doing this requires grappling with AEMO data that is a lot more obscure than the usual 5-minute and 30-minute market data dealt with by products like NEM-Watch and ez2view (as if that data isn’t obscure enough!). Another reason for the delay in getting this article together. Product Manager’s Note: Coincident with Allan’s article here, we have been investigating the inclusion of this 4-second SCADA data into one or more of our products. It’s logged with an internal job number of TFS-9575. We’d like to speak with clients who would have an interest in using this data, in order that we can work through the complexities that this inclusion would necessitate. Please give us a call (+61 7 3368 4064). A quirk of the FCAS markets means that AEMO publishes operational data from its Energy Management System which captures SCADA data every four seconds on generator outputs, system frequency, and other arcana. For very good reasons commercial electricity market viewer / analysis products don’t deal with this level of detail, but it’s the best available public source to understand what happens in response to a large unit trip. It’s this sub-5 minute world that FCAS is concerned with. I’m not sure if market operators anywhere else in the world routinely publish data at this level of operational detail, but I’d be surprised if many do. For a start we can look at what NEM generation levels and system frequency were doing for the five minutes up to and just after the Loy Yang A3 trip: Here we are looking at a single five-minute dispatch interval. The blue Generation line is essentially total scheduled generation in the NEM, and the red Target line is what AEMO has instructed that generation to produce by the end of the interval. The fact that generation exceeds the target level by around 80-100 MW for most of the interval could reflect a number of factors, for example scheduled demand being higher than forecast by AEMO (requiring some generators to be dispatched upwards in the raise regulation FCAS market, to maintain system frequency at 50 Hz). The Frequency line shows system frequency which is nominally 50 Hz, with a normal tolerance range of +/- 0.15 Hz, indicated by the upper and lower reference lines. The grey shaded time interval covers just over 30 seconds (from 1:58:55 AM to 1:59:31 AM) during which the Loy Yang A unit’s output fell from nearly 550 MW to zero as the generator went offline. You can clearly see the effect on system frequency – as input to the grid drops, its frequency begins to slow down, just like a vehicle travelling steadily up a hill would decelerate if its engine power fell. In fact power system frequency is the direct analogue of speed, because it reflects the rate of rotation of all the spinning synchronous generators and motors connected to the system. You can also see a notch in the overall generation level corresponding to the falloff of the Loy Yang A unit, but interestingly this is nothing like as large as the 550 MW loss of generation from that unit, and quickly bounces back to close to where it was – so what’s going on? And finally as generation bounces back, system frequency stabilises although it still sits below the lower tolerance band. We know the tripped Loy Yang A unit didn’t suddenly come back online, so other generators must have made up the deficiency – which ones? The next chart, covering 30 seconds either side of the trip, is a bit busy, but it highlights the fact that many generators across the NEM responded, prompted by the falling system frequency. This is a great example of FCAS in action: The top panel is essentially a closeup of the same Reneweconomy chart that prompted all this, showing the rundown of the Loy Yang A unit (LH axis) and the response of the Tesla battery / Hornsdale Power Reserve (RH axis). The middle panel shows the increase in output from the whole subset of generators around the NEM that materially responded to the event (plenty didn’t). To be clear, except for the battery and the Jindabyne hydro unit in blue, these generators were already online and producing before the trip – they simply increased their output, using what’s known as “spinning reserve”. In terms of FCAS markets, this response would be primarily the fast raise (6 second) and slow raise (60 second) contingency services enabled by AEMO. For emphasis, I’ve highlighted in red the responses from the SA battery and also from Gladstone in Queensland. It’s very clear that they were only a small part of the overall story, nor was either the first to respond to the event. In fact most of the response came from old-fashioned coal-fired stations. That’s not at all surprising, because in this overnight timeframe with low demand it’s predominantly coal generation that’s online, and contrary to what you might expect from reading elsewhere, during low to moderate demand periods online coal fired generation can usually vary its output fast enough, in aggregate, to respond perfectly adequately to this kind of event . [Finally a note on chronology – it’s curious that system frequency appears to start falling well before the major changes in generation, by about 12-20 seconds, and then to stabilise before the bulk of the generation response arrives. Whilst the data used in these charts is all timestamped according to AEMO’s public files, I strongly suspect there are some measurement lags or timing offsets present in this raw operational data, and it’s likely that in real time the inflection points in frequency and generation levels respectively line up much more closely than shown above.] About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

    "title": "Just because a company wears a “green halo”, that does not mean it can disrespect its potential customers [UPDATED]",
    "date": "21-03-2018 11:26:00 AM",
    "content": "It’s a relatively rare occurrence that I have time, or inclination, to sit down and watch TV – but the past weekend’s elections (in SA, and Batman) was one of the reasons that prompted me to spend some time channel surfing to see what was being said in various quarters about energy/climate policy in those frames: … however before anyone heads off on a tangent in that respect, let me reiterate what I noted on this LinkedIn thread that “I also know the tendency of many to think of elections as single issue concerns. There are other concerns at play as well in SA (despite the fact energy nerds like us might overlook them)” At regular intervals over this period, the adverts came on – as a result of which I either flipped channel, or reverted to something akin to a semi-comatose state. However one particular advertisement did wake me up. I do apologise that I was not quick enough to snap an image of the screen at the time, but have summed up the high points of how it played out below: 1) An advertisement by a residentially-focused solar company came on the TV. These all seem pretty similar in form, and the company names are all pretty unremarkable – but I’m pretty sure that that this one was from True Value Solar (** though it turned out this was incorrect, as noted) (happy to be corrected if someone can point out if it was from some other [Non Memorable Brand] Solar company). ** Update, Correction & Apology on Fri 4th May (PART 1/2) At the time of posting this article (21st March) I reached out to True Value Solar (TVS) on social media in the hope of confirming whether my recollection was correct, in it being their advertisement. Thankfully, on 2nd May a representative from TVS contacted me to inform me that they had not run television advertisements during March in Brisbane, and hence that my recollection had been incorrect (see more about the conversation below). I thank them for closing the loop on this one. Given that they had not run television advertising during March in Brisbane, I do not understand why my mind had so firmly associated the advertisement (to which I had experienced an emotional reaction, as noted in this post) to their brand. There is food there for more consideration about the marketing challenges in a commodity business (historically like electricity retail, and now perhaps like solar panels), and perhaps another post later. For any of our readers who had unfortunately linked the company to this advertisement that I’d criticised, I do apologise. I do also apologise to the people at True Value Solar, who (it was noted) are working very hard to ensure a high quality service for their customers. 2) We’re currently happy with our own solar setup ( as noted before ), so I initially remained in my zen-like state. 3) However my “BS detector” went on red alert when I heard words along the lines of “how much could you save with your own solar system” in the advert, together with some pretty specific (and large) numbers flashed up on the screen. Can’t remember what the number was now, but it might have been well in excess of $10,000 (enough to really wake my internal cynic up). 4) My sense of concern awakened, I proceeded to watch the rest of the advert only to see in the fine print at the end something along the lines of “based on typical customer in South Australia”. Now, my sense is that it would be widely understood that public perceptions of the energy sector as a whole are pretty much on the nose in recent times (perhaps even taking the mantle of “most despised industry” from the banking sector). This might be the reason that others are concerned about advertisements like these – but I see things from the other direction: 1) My perspective is that advertisements like these imply to me a disrespect of potential customers – and my sense is that this is fairly endemic in the energy sector. 2) With this frame of reference, I perceive many examples of “engineers flogging products” rather than trying to understand what the customer actually wants, and meeting that need. 3) Unfortunately in this current multi-faceted energy transition , I have a concern that this situation might be getting worse before it gets better – with the influx of new entrants flogging their [INSERT MAGIC BULLET] as if it will cure all ills: (a) One of the latest magic bullet seems to be about batteries, with commentary ranging over the whole spectrum about the (for now) “world’s biggest battery” ranging from “does nothing at all” to “does everything, and makes your lunch as well”. (b) At a residential level, because of the complexities involved in batteries that aren’t there with (relatively inert) solar PV, we’ve been working in several ways to help on that front for a number of years as noted here (with an interesting aside that this Energy Storage Register developed with this process was available well before the March 2018 launch of what Energy QLD have apparently claimed to be “Australia’s first home battery storage database” ) I noted at the top, just because a “new entrant” in the energy sector wears a green halo (or even dreams of creating the “Uber of energy”, or something like that) does not give them carte-blanche to disrespect the customer . And, to me, advertisements like this reek of that disrespect . Some context to my perspective on that advertisement So let me explain some context, to help those who are not aware: 1) I am an energy nerd, and data junkie, rolled into one. 2) Given that tendency, operating a company that focuses on helping our customers make better decisions, by making the energy sector more understandable, means a closely aligned mission. That’s one of the reasons why we have grown over 18 years to serve a large and diverse client base across Australia and elsewhere as well. 3) We operate in the B2B space (not B2C) but even our interactions with our clients reveal a very broad spread of “energy literacy” in the mix of people we deal with. This sense is further reinforced by the diverse range of feedback we receive on WattClarity , and with respect to various other services we provide that are in the public domain (like the upgraded RenewEconomy Widget , and others you might come across on different parts of the web). (a) Some people know far more than us (and we are very grateful when they help to drag us up the learning curve by pointing out where our software could be better, for instance). (b) However we have experienced a big spread of people whose understanding of energy ranges down to what can only be described as “non-existent” or “very basic”. I would expect that there would be a large distribution of these sorts of people who would have seen the advertisement noted above on free-to-air TV early in whatever evening it was I saw it come on. I am concerned that these people will not have such a finely tuned BS Detector as my exposure to loads of energy sector data has tuned mine to be. 4) I’m a happy owner of a residential rooftop PV system at home and keen to continue exploring what the available data can tell me about our own consumption profile. 5) Oh yes – I live happily in Brisbane , and (though I travel frequently) was definitely at home over the past week when I noticed the South Australian focused case study cited as evidence of how much a Brisbane-based homeowner could save . Perhaps some readers can help me understand? I’m trying to understand what went on at various stages of the process leading to that advertisement going to air on Brisbane night time TV, but can’t see any real reason that does not suggest that the company was disrespecting its potential customers: Possibility #1) Perhaps the company has prepared different case studies for each location, and the TV channel screwed up in broadcasting the wrong one in the wrong location? Possibility #2) Perhaps the company does not realise that electricity prices are significantly different in different regions of the NEM? But I would find that hard to believe given what’s seemed to be a very wide coverage of the debate/discussion/yelling-match at different points in time about how various state government policies have contributed (or not) to different levels of electricity pricing in different locations. Possibility #3) Perhaps the company does realise that prices are significantly different, but decided to run with a case study based on a customer in SA in the QLD market in any case? If they did this, then the next obvious question is why? How does this not demonstrate disrespect for its potential customer base – to present a case study that is, in large part, irrelevant to the audience that you are targeting? That’s only the start of the can of worms, however. I know that the larger energy retailers have invested (and are investing) considerable money in developing dozens of different “typical” customer profiles – based on factors such as: Size and type of residence (free-standing, apartment, etc) Occupancy details (number and type of people, whether they are home during the day or not) Types of energy-hungry gadgets they might have (air-conditioners, pool pumps, etc…) Types of distributed energy resources they have (solar PV, batteries, electric vehicles and software to monitor) Tariff structures (what types of feed-in-tariff is applicable, and so on) and so on… Given this is the environment we are rapidly transitioning to , for how much longer can any energy service company (green halo or not) expect to get away with gobsmackingly crude case studies that essentially seek to reinforce the very out-dated (by at least a decade) concept “all residential customer are equal”? Anyone who truly understands the energy sector will know the answer to the question of “how much would a solar system save you” is a very big “it depends…” – so leaving aside the slap in the face that the company seemed to give its potential Brisbane-based customers by not even presenting a case study based on real data for Brisbane, there are still huge (and growing) problems with this sort of very simplistic quotations of (what I strongly suspect are cherry-picked) benefits. Ultimately, it does not matter what colour your climate-focused ideology, as an energy sector participant we all need to become much better at respecting our potential customers – as (with advertisements like these) we seem to be reinforcing the general public sense that what comes out of our mouths when we speak looks brown, and smells like shit. As a final note, a quick search reveals this case in 2011 where True Value Solar was issued infringement notices by the ACCC for misleading advertising , but this was followed in 2016 by another undertaking (again by TVS) to stop offering what reads to me as bribes for positive reviews . That’s not a good look (** though see note here about the need to separate the past from the present) ! ** Update, Correction & Apology on Fri 4th May (PART 2/2) In the conversation on Wednesday 2nd May, it was explained that the company (TVS) had been through an ownership change, with the new owners keen to ensure people understood that much about the company had changed since those unfortunate days of the past. I can understand what a challenge it might be, from a marketing/positioning perspective, with history such as these two examples readily available on the internet.",

    "title": "Power System Frequency – What is it doing? – Why does it matter?",
    "date": "06-03-2018 07:14:00 PM",
    "content": "The East Coast power system of Australia has the worst frequency regulation in the developed world. This puts the system at risk whenever an event occurs which requires the generators to respond quickly – they can’t respond quickly if they have to wait for the system frequency to go outside its control system dead band. It is like driving a car with a loose steering wheel, or more pertinently, with a loose brake pedal and accelerator pedal. Everything will be fine if you are just cruising along and nothing happens, but if someone jumps out in front of you, that fraction of a second lost in applying the brakes because of “slop” in the braking system could be crucial. In power systems the “slop” (i.e. a lack of response to changes in system frequency) makes the possibility of an unrecoverable generation/load mismatch just a bit more likely – possibly leading to a system-wide blackout. How did we get to this situation? Some clues as to what has been going on can be seen when comparing the mainland frequency with the frequency of Tasmania. The two systems are connected together by a high voltage DC link (Basslink), so they don’t have to operate at the same frequency. However, the Basslink control system is set up so that power flows across the link are constantly updated to keep the frequencies of each of the systems tracking each other. Obviously the mainland is much bigger than Tasmania so you would expect it to be setting the frequency which the Tasmanian system then follows. This is not what happens. Consider what happens if the link were to be disconnected. This happened in 2016 due to a cable fault, and counterintuitively the frequency regulation of Tasmania improved. The connection to the mainland makes the frequency regulation of Tasmanian system worse, not better, which is opposite to the original intent of the Basslink control system. Tasmania is actually improving the frequency regulation of the mainland in general– a clear case of the tail wagging the dog if ever there was one. When Tasmania was disconnected from the mainland two key observations were made. The frequency regulation of Tasmania improved (by quite a lot), and in absolute terms the frequency regulation of the mainland also slightly improved but in a way that made visible the dead band (or the “slop”) that exists in the mainland collective generator control systems. The main land frequency control seems to be done by what is derisively known as “bang-bang” control. For example, when the frequency gets too high: push it down when it gets too low: pull it up Anywhere in between – do nothing . Effectively when the frequency is between nominated limits it is not controlled or to put it another way it is out of control If something happens on the system (e.g. a loss of generation event in a region as happened prior to the South Australian blackout) – it won’t respond until it is too late and the lights will go out. In the worst case scenario this could happen along the whole east coast of Australia. So who or what is affecting the system frequency? All that is needed to understand the basics of frequency regulation is as follows: To raise the system frequency – increase the dispatch of generator power output To lower the system frequency – do the opposite The output of all generators on the system is logged by AEMO at four – second intervals which is sufficient resolution for monitoring frequency regulation. Whenever a generator or load changes its power output for whatever reason it will change the power system frequency. It is relatively straightforward using signal processing techniques to see which generators are changing power output the most and hence affecting power system frequency. The units on the mainland that we have observed which affect the frequency the most are the Snowy Hydro units at Tumut and Murray. These have often been the units of choice in regulating system frequency, and with the exception of some isolated events, such as large generator trips, or rapid changes in large thermal generator output – these are the units that affect the frequency the most. In particular the impact of renewable generation currently connected to the system on system frequency is virtually insignificant. This is not a surprise; currently the capacity of renewable generation is less than about 15% of the total system generation and is spread out amongst a huge number of individual generators which never change power dispatch in unison. Statistically renewable generation cannot and does not significantly impact the overall power system frequency. That is not to say this will not become a problem in the future, but right now in 2018, the frequency is being impacted on by the traditional units and we can easily see this in the 4 second data. Frequency Control Ancillary Services Market (FCAS) The NEM has several markets which are meant to control system frequency. I think it is not a coincidence that the systems which have the worst frequency control are the ones that also have ancillary services markets. The Australian and UK power systems exhibit the worst control over system frequency probably because of their respective ancillary services markets rather than despite it, even though the details of each country’s market are quite different. In 2017, the Australian NEM recorded more than $200 million dollars in frequency control ancillary services payments. This seems to be a lot of money redistributed amongst various market participants in order to provide the poorest frequency control in the developed world. We have analysed some of the payment and recovery records which are publicly available and can report the following: There appears to be no correlation between frequency control and the volume of ancillary service payments. There appears to be no correlation between frequency control and the various FCAS market prices There appears to be no correlation between the volume or price of frequency control ancillary payments and any events on the system which cause frequency deviations. There is no correlation between the volume or price of FCAS payments and the actual cost of providing frequency control services. In summary the term “frequency control” appears to be a misnomer, at best the ancillary services market operated in the NEM could be termed a “generation dispatch balancing market” which assists in balancing what the dispatch engine requests generators to output and with what the system actually requires. This latter service might be useful in operating a real time market which imperfectly dispatches power, but it has little or nothing to do with system frequency control. We are sowing seeds of confusion by naming it “Frequency control ancillary services”. The term “causer pays” is equally misleading. Generators which don’t quite meet their generation dispatch targets may well be doing so because they are responding in real time to local system frequency conditions. Under current arrangements they could be penalized for having good frequency control governor systems. It is irrational to penalize units which support frequency control and reward units which don’t but this is what the market appears to be doing. If allowed to continue this course will ultimately lead to a system which goes out of control and results in a system wide blackout. So what to do? Do we redesign the market? Make it more focussed on control of frequency rather than merely balancing dispatch, via time error set point control? I personally don’t believe that will solve the issue. The market has been in operation for nearly two decades and it appears no one has cast a critical eye on its workings until recently. Alarmingly, the control of frequency has gradually deteriorated in the meantime to the extent that it is becoming a threat to power system security. Who is to say a newly designed market will not also exhibit unforeseen pathologies? Another approach is to recognise that frequency control is a technical not a market function. The requirement for good system frequency control is essential for system security. I am of the opinion that ensuring good control systems are installed on the system and in good working order should not be left to the whims of a poorly designed market.

    "title": "Short term forecasting of wind power plant generation for the provision of ancillary services",
    "date": "06-03-2018 07:12:00 PM",
    "content": "Introduction The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), like many other international competitive market based electricity systems, must address system security and dispatch challenges associated with the introduction of increasing levels of intermittent generators. Both wind and solar power plants are being integrated into an existing market design that was based on the scheduled dispatch of hydro, coal and gas power plants. As countries respond to their agreed emission targets, intermittent generators are now a substantial proportion of the generation portfolio and the need to efficiently dispatch and manage system security is becoming critical in many international electricity markets. As noted in [1] , Wind Power Plants (WPP) in the NEM are currently dispatched as a semi-scheduled generator and can generate at any level unless constrained by network or pricing constraints. Dispatch intervals within the NEM are co-optimized between energy and Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) market bids with the NEM dispatch engine (NEMDE) optimizing the price paid by the market for both energy and ancillary services by analyzing the market offers, capability of all generating units, loads, and unit ramp rates. For NEMDE to optimally dispatch a generator, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) requires accurate information on the prevailing conditions at the wind power plant. The existing AEMO Australian Wind Energy Forecasting System (AWEFS) uses a mixture of persistence forecasts, wind speed and turbine availability to create the Unconstrained Intermittent Generation Forecast (UIGF) for wind power plants to produce a central forecast ranging from 5 minutes to 7 days. Changes in the past 12 months [2] have increased the amount of SCADA information sent to AEMO by wind power plants to augment the inputs to NEMDE, including an optional estimated power capability of the wind power plant: a signal from the SCADA system using vendor specific variants of a “capability right now” (also known as “Possible Power”, “Capable Power”, “Park Potential Power” or “Active Power Available”). The challenge with using a ‘now’ value is that the dispatch algorithm is working towards a power system security solution for 5 minutes into the future. As NEM wind power plants progressively work towards implementing FCAS, the criticality of ensuring that the power system either a) takes account of the variability in the wind forecasts coming from the wind power plants in the coming 5-7 minutes and follows the wind direction, or b) sets an appropriate dispatch level to ensure wind variability is minimized [1] , becomes even more important for market and power system operators. Accurate 5 minute wind forecasts are critical for power system stability assessments which continually assess the power system to ensure adequate MW capability is available for contingency-based events. As WPP progressively provide ancillary services, power system operator confidence that the WPP will be able to provide the enabled contingency response will be paramount. Forecasting approaches There are many different wind forecasting techniques that have been used for predicting the output of wind power plants and the nature of the approaches used is determined by the forecasting horizons required and the time scales being studied. A detailed review of published wind power and speed forecasting techniques can be found in [3] and classifies the published forecasting approaches based on their intended time horizons and intended application. Time-scale Classification for Forecasts [3] : Time horizon Range Applications Very short-term Few seconds to 30 minutes ahead Electricity market clearing Regulation actions Short-term 30 minutes to 6 hours ahead Economic load dispatch planning Load increment/decrement decisions Medium-term 6 hours to 1 day ahead Generator online/offline decisions Operational security in day ahead markets Maintenance scheduling Long-term 1 day to 1 week or more ahead Unit commitment decisions Reserve requirement decisions A more recent study [4] also includes a summary of the recent advances for wind forecasting and power prediction including global to local scales, ensemble forecasting and upscaling and downscaling processes. Based upon the time scale of the forecasting required, the most common forecasting techniques developed and reported can be classified as follows. Persistence Method The “Naive Predictor” is used as the benchmark for many forecasting techniques and simply uses the wind speed or generation at time t as the forecast for a later time [5] . The equation specifies for the persistence forecast that the power forecast for time t + k made at the time origin t is the measured power at time t. Many papers have made the point that for very short to short time scales, the persistence forecast performs better than many forecasting techniques and is very difficult to improve upon [4][5] . Physical approach Physical systems are based on modelling the physical atmosphere and environmental conditions of the wind power plant and often use weather services on a course grid adapted to the location and topology of the site. Complex mathematical models used by Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) approaches are provided by weather services to produce forecasts based on temperature, pressure, surface conditions and roughness and are run a few times over a single day for timescales up to 7 days and are therefore only suited to medium to long time-scale forecasting. Machine learning and statistical approaches Modern machine learning techniques and the availability of cheap fast computing resources have presented the opportunity to significantly improve the forecasting capabilities of wind power plants and provide reliable short term forecasts that are a substantial improvement of the simple persistence forecasts that remain the benchmark for short time-scale generation forecasting techniques. The forecasting of the short time-scale wind generation for the integration of wind power into the Australian NEM was described in the early stages of the market in a series of papers describing the modelling of Tasmanian wind power plants in advance of Tasmania being connected to the Australian mainland NEM market with the Basslink DC inter-connector using a combination approach of ANN models and fuzzy inference systems [6][7][8] . These papers correctly anticipated the requirement of the NEM to be able to accurately forecast wind power plants with the anticipated increased participation of renewable wind energy, the need for reliable dispatch of generators and the requirements for the provision of ancillary services. Many short-term modelling approaches have been used for the wind generation forecasting problem. Wake effects and physical configuration of offshore wind power plants was presented in [9] where possible power forecasts were made using SCADA plant measurements and numerical wake models that focused on the interaction effects between turbines that are common to many wind power plants locations. Other machine learning approaches for short term power forecasting have included Support Vector Machines [10] , neural networks and adaptive Bayesian learning [11] and k-means clustering with ANN models [12] . The modelling approach in this paper is based on an initial experimentation process where a wide variety of machine learning approaches were evaluated, and an approach formulated that provided the best combination of predictive power and computational efficiency and performance to produce a robust and practical short time-scale wind power generation forecast for a wide variety of conditions. A standardized performance evaluation of short term wind power prediction models has been proposed by [5] and shall be used for the operational framework for the presented case study and the evaluation and comparison of the model results. Given that the focus of this research is to find a reliable and effective forecasting approach over a single time horizon of 5 minutes, many of the lead time measures proposed in [5] are not appropriate for this study. Evaluation and comparison of forecasting models The main measure that will be used for the forecast model development, evaluations and comparisons will be based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value defined as: And for model evaluation, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) shall also be used: Statistically the MAE(k) is associated with the first moment of the prediction error that are directly related to the produced energy and the RMSE(k) values are associated with the second order moment relating to the variance of the prediction error. All error measures are calculated using the prediction error e(t + k|t). For comparisons between models to highlight any relative improvement of one technique or set of parameters, a relative gain will be used to measure the improvement with respect to the reference model that will be the persistence model for all studies: Here the EC is the Evaluation Criterion such as MAE or RMSE for the reference persistence model and for the forecasting model being considered. Characteristics of the studied wind plant Figure 1: Normalized turbine layout of studied wind power plant The studied wind power plant is a wind generator located in South East New South Wales, Australia with 51 turbines incorporating a mixture of Vestas V90 and V100 type 1.8 MW, 2 MW and 3 MW turbines. Total generation capacity for the wind power plant is 107 MW. The normalized turbine layout where the dominant axis has been mapped to a 100 unit nominal length is shown in Fig. 1. The wind power plant uses the HARD software Infolite SCADA interface collecting very detailed data at a polling frequency of one minute, including a substantial range of turbine measurements and possible power estimate for the entire plant and was selected for the initial study to ensure a wide range of data could be considered. The turbine locations for the wind power plant are a mix of hill-top, increasing gradient as well as flatter landscape profiles with a vertical distance between the lowest and highest wind turbines of nearly 90 m at approximately 960 m above sea level. The variation in site topology and turbine types presents challenging operating conditions and an even more challenging forecasting environment. Forecasting approach Early exploration and models The initial investigation explored the nature of the very short-term forecasting problem from the perspective of using SCADA data that was easily available from common wind power plant control systems. Typically, the minimum data that is available from the control system are the meteorological measurements at key positions on the power plant site, individual turbine generation, turbine availability and total plant generation. Additionally, some power plants also measure wind speed and direction at the turbine nacelle, nacelle direction and calculate a possible power measurement for the current plant state. The initial investigation of the short-term wind forecasting problem is discussed in detail in a previous paper [13] and this current paper shall focus only on the development of the turbine cluster and ensemble model and later developments and application of that model. Turbine cluster & ensemble generation forecast model Previous studies that used a turbine clustering approach for the short-term forecasting of wind power plant generation used unsupervised statistical techniques such as k-means clustering that groups a set of observations around observed initial cluster centres [12] and supervised learning techniques, such as the k-nearest neighbors technique, that was considered in the initial exploratory investigation. The turbine clustering approach used for this study considers the static locations of the turbines, the local topology and the dynamic environmental conditions. Each of the turbines are assigned to a static cluster for a set of conditions and then an overall ensemble model is then used by aggregating the predicted generation cluster forecasts to produce a forecast for the entire wind power plant. For this study, stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) models [14] were used for the individual cluster models and both stochastic gradient boosting and ANN models were used for the ensemble models, thus producing a forecast for the entire wind power plant over a very large range of differing input environmental conditions. Turbine ensemble deep learning model Although the initial results for the turbine cluster and ensemble model were encouraging for the studied wind power plant, application of the same technique to other generators did not reproduce the performance of the forecasting model with small improvements in RMSE and MAE in comparison to the persistence model for one plant and, for another, virtually no improvement from the persistence model at all. The reasons for the lack of generalization of the model and poor performance when applied to these other wind power plants is not yet fully understood at this stage, but there were varying sector management policies and network support functions present that may need to be identified and excluded or nullified prior to training the model before reasonable results can be produced. A more general alternative ensemble approach without fine grained clustering was then formulated to attempt to improve the performance of the forecasting model and to understand if there was a fundamental issue with the data or plant environment that would prevent a reasonable forecasting model from predicting short-term generation. A new set of data was produced using a single ensemble of model data for the same range of dynamic environmental conditions and that data was then normalized for use with a deep learning ANN model. The data included individual turbine generation, change in generation, “one-hot” encoding of availability and a range of summary statistics of MET data producing about 133 input variables. To determine the influence of the forecasting approach on the wind power forecasting model, the same ensemble data was also used to train a Stochastic Gradient Boosting machine learning model for comparison to the ANN model. Forecasting results Turbine cluster & ensemble forecast results Clustering the turbines into groups and running ensemble models to produce the power plant forecast had a very substantial effect on the model training times and computational resources required to train the model. For all the initial investigation and the single generator machine learning models it was feasible to train and run the evaluations on a single MacBook Pro laptop but the learning times for the clustered model took too long to complete for this approach to be feasible for the clustered models. A Compute Optimized 32 core 60 GB memory AWS C3.8xlarge instance running Ubuntu 16.04 was used to develop the clustering and ensemble turbine models where typical run times for each training and evaluation run for a turbine cluster model were about 24 hours on this optimized AWS instance. Once the model has been trained and developed, evaluation is a very quick operation making both the stochastic gradient boost and ANN models ideally suited for production deployment. For the cluster model, 314,357 observations were used with the input data being randomly split into 90% of the data forming the training set with 285,779 observations and an independent validation data set comprising 28578 records. No part of the validation set was used in the training of the turbine cluster or ensemble model. The procedure for the training of the model is shown in Fig. 2 where the validation dataset has not been used in any part of the training of the model. Figure 2: Procedure for developing the short-term generation model (click imageto view in more detail) A k-fold cross-validation approach was used to train the models with 10 splits on the training data and a negative mean squared loss function was used for the model training. Various combinations of input fields were used for the stochastic gradient boosting model for both the individual turbine clusters and the ensemble model. The SGB model can display the feature importance of each of the input fields and so by determining the contribution each field makes to the forecast results; the models can be refined. There are many different parameters that are available to be tuned for the SGB model such as the learning rate, depth of trees, number of trees and the minimum child weight and the results were relatively insensitive to most parameter changes and continued to find consistent optimal values even when large ranges of parameters were tested. The number of trees parameter was the exception where large numbers of trees would give low training evaluation scores but perform worse on the independent validation dataset indicating that the model was over-fitted to the training data. The turbine cluster and ensemble model using the SGB model for both the clusters and the ensemble produced a range of RMSE improvements in comparison to the persistence forecast for this preliminary model of 7.2% to 10.7% and for the MAE 9.1% to 10.4%. Considering the early stages of development of the forecasting model and the recent completion of the clustering implementation, the observed results are very encouraging and certainly much better than any of the single generation forecast wind power plant models. Lastly an ANN ensemble model was run on the ensemble data using the SGB model for the turbine clusters without any refinement or development just prior to this paper being completed with resulting improvements in RMSE compared to the persistence forecast of 8.8% and MAE of 7.5%. Given that no tuning or development of the ANN model has been possible, it may prove that ANN is a more effective means of producing the final ensemble forecast rather than the stochastic gradient model and this result influenced the decision to develop the later ensemble deep learning model. Turbine ensemble deep learning model results The turbine ensemble deep learning forecasting models were trained using the same training dataset for the previous cluster and ensemble model. A wide variety of ANN topologies were tested using the deep learning Theano library, incorporating wide and deep networks and various formulations of hidden layers, using 20% of the training data as validation during the supervised training process. The final trained model was then evaluated on the independent validation data set and compared to the equivalent persistence model error results on the same validation data to determine if any improvement had been produced. The best model results produced using the ANN machine learning model was an improvement in RMSE of 11.9% and for the MAE of 11.4% in comparison to the persistence forecast and therefore produced better results than the turbine cluster and ensemble model. Fig 3. shows the error distribution by wind direction for the modelled wind power plant of the filtered SCADA data with the equivalent distributions of persistent RMSE, model RMSE and the improvement in RMSE between the naïve persistent model and the best ANN model. The top chart in Fig. 3 shows the wind direction distribution of the number of observations, the next chart the RMSE persistent errors, then the forecast RMSE errors and lastly the bottom chart shows the improvement of the RMSE of the forecast model in comparison to the persistence model. The same turbine ensemble data formulation was then used to train a Stochastic Gradient Boosting machine learning model with a variety of learning parameters and produced a substantial improvement in the RMSE of 14.2% and MAE of 14.6% and has demonstrated the best forecasting performance of any of the machine learning models currently being developed. Figure 3: ANN model RMSE error distribution by wind direction Figure 4: SGB model RMSE error distribution by wind direction Fig 4. shows the wind direction distribution of the RMSE errors and improvement in RMSE with respect to the persistence model RMSE errors by wind direction and it can be seen by comparison to the ANN results shown in Fig 3. using the same chart format, that the SGB model improvements are much more evenly spread across all the wind directions, but the ANN model produced substantially better performance on a small number of wind directions. By selectively using the ANN model and SGB model based on measured wind direction, a hybrid model improvement in RMSE of 15.0% and MAE of 14.6% was achieved but how practical combining the models is for production forecasting implementations remains to be demonstrated. These results are very encouraging, and the authors have been unable to find any reported instances of better wind forecasting error rates in comparison to persistence forecasts for very short term wind generation. Figure 5: Procedure for producing generation forecasts (click image to view in more detail) The current study has been undertaken with the ultimate objective of implementing the developed and refined forecasting model into a production device that can be implemented within the wind power plant SCADA system. The production forecast implementation is required to operate under a wide range of input conditions and must be robust and reliable. If the inputs to the forecast model do not meet the model validation requirements, the forecast model will revert to using the persistent forecast value rather than risk the production of an erronous forecast value and produce poor outcomes (Fig. 5). Individual wind power plant locations, site details and production data will be used to create a dedicated set of models for the generator. Once a suitably trained set of models has been developed for a specific site, the implementation of the new forecasting technique will be directed toward replacing the existing Australian NEM intermittent generator AWEFS dispatch forecast with the revised, trained estimation of the likely generation in the coming 5 to 7 minute dispatch period. The implementation of the forecasting device will have the following effects for both the generator and the system operator: Provide a more accurate forecast for the wind power plant to reduce its deviation from the dispatch target calculated by AEMO and thereby reducing any ‘causer-pays’ penalties [15] ; allow the wind generator to potentially participate in raise FCAS contingency and regulation markets by providing accurate, unconstrained generation forecasts; and contributing to the reduction in the uncertainty of individual wind generators, provide more accurate regulation requirement estimations for AEMO to ensure appropriate control of secondary-order primary frequency control. The device is being designed as a dedicated server that will have a direct connection to the SCADA system through the modbus, DNP3 or possibly IEC 61400-25 protocols and can provide a web service interface, write directly to the SCADA and database for later validation and analysis. The device will be supported remotely and will be updated at regular intervals with model updates and refinements. Conclusions and future work This paper presents the encouraging preliminary results of the development of a dedicated machine learning device for the 5 to 7 minute forecasting of generation for wind power plants. Further development of the model is required to improve the clustering, tune the machine learning algorithms and demonstrate the capabilities and robustness of the forecasting approach over a sustained period of operation and for a larger set of diverse wind power plants.

    "title": "Let’s Keep Talking About FCAS",
    "date": "06-03-2018 07:09:00 PM",
    "content": "In the article I prepared this time last year, Let’s Talk About FCAS , readers were reminded that Ancillary Services Matter! In every power system around the world, be they large interconnected systems or smaller microgrids, the requirement to ensure this important element is addressed has continued to evolve. Within the NEM, we have seen the introduction of the Hornsdale Power Reserve dominate FCAS news (and so it should)! Through this post, I would like to reinforce for us to keep talking about FCAS because it still matters. The previous article noted some of the reasons why we need services such as FCAS, and the importance they play in the stability of the grid. The recent work by the AEMC and AEMO have contributed substantially to the body of knowledge around technical capability and performance, and I would encourage people to get more involved in these discussions and forums. The success of the recent Hornsdale 2 FCAS wind farm trials, along with similar trials in California with a 300MW solar plant and continuing acceptance by transmission and market operators around the ability of inverter-based equipment to supply these services are all very encouraging. But the piece I would like to focus on is the business case and subsequent optimisation challenge for getting involved in FCAS, now that the technical performance components have been mostly addressed. As one of my discussions recently noted, “we know we can do it [FCAS], but should we?”. The answer is … it depends! There are numerous elements that enter the discussion around economic assessment of FCAS but the key factors include the technical capability of the unit or facility (ie the response capability and duration) and existing value/conditions of the underlying energy (ie PPA or merchant, environmental certificates etc). At present, most owners and operators would see generation maximisation as the primary means of revenue optimisation; and to a large extent that is correct. Increasingly, as further generation developments occur particularly with solar, the amount of underlying curtailment that may occur in various parts of the network will also be an important consideration. In the image shown below, the typical generation profile (green) may be impacted through the middle of the time period due to pricing and/or network constraint issues, resulting in periods of curtailment (orange). The resulting foregone generation (yellow) may be, at times, an ideal opportunity to provide FCAS raise services rather than simply forego that generation. But knowing when to take advantage of this opportunity is the realm of optimisation calculations … and that is where the fun begins. Editor’s Note – readers might be interested in this analysis performed in September 2017 of how much wind output had been curtailed in South Australia over the preceding 8 week period – amounting to 65GWh, which is not an insignificant volume (or revenue opportunity, for the generators affected). When considering the type and nature of the optimisation for intermittent generation such as solar and wind, a secondary challenge comes from estimating what the green line would have been had the curtailment not occurred, a critical component for system operators when it comes to FCAS provision from intermittent sources. The possible or forecast power work is already covered in a WattClarity post by Harley Mackenzie . Some of the other factors taken into consideration: What is the actual and forecast energy and FCAS price, and how likely are these to occur? What is the current and future generation forecast for the plant, and therefore, how much FCAS can be provided? and Any other control schemes or special requirements are in place that will impact on Energy/ FCAS optimisation? All of these elements have existed in the NEM since FCAS markets began in 2001. But it is one of the key elements of the FCAS market design, the FCAS Trapezium, that makes the NEM particularly well equipped to handle intermittent generation co-optimisation with 5-minute dispatch and FCAS markets. As the facility increases or decreases its energy MWs, the amount of FCAS that can be provided by the facility changes progressively (as denoted by the changing size of the energy (blue) and FCAS (red) amounts as demonstrated in the image below. In the particular example shown, at the top end of the Energy MW continuum, very little FCAS can be enabled because the facility cannot go much higher than its max capacity. Conversely, at the lower end of the MW continuum, a facility can only potentially ramp up by a certain amount during a frequency event, therefore it does not matter how much energy is curtailed below point b, the same amount of FCAS will be enabled (area x). When FCAS offers are submitted and combined with energy offers in NEMDE, an optimal dispatch across Energy and FCAS markets can occur and the cheapest solution possible is found. Most batteries and solar plant, as well as some wind farms, can provide their MW response even while energy MWs are at/near 0MW, thereby allowing for potentially curtailed MW periods in the future to be provided by plant that may have been otherwise nearly offline. Wrapping Up Ancillary Services still matter! As the energy transition continues, the power grid will continue to show pricing signals for FCAS markets given the close co-optimisation between energy and FCAS market pricing in NEMDE. As some of the remaining technical boundary issues are solved, we look forward to observing a time when increasing amounts of solar, wind and battery supplied FCAS are enabled.

    "title": "Power station ‘trips’ are normal, but blackouts are not",
    "date": "20-02-2018 10:30:00 AM",
    "content": "Tens of thousands of Victorians were left without power over the long weekend as the distribution network struggled with blistering temperatures, reigniting fears about the stability of our energy system. It comes on the heels of a summer of “trips” , when power stations temporarily shut down for a variety of reasons. This variability has also been used to attack renewable energy such as wind and solar, which naturally fluctuate depending on weather conditions. The reality is that blackouts, trips and intermittency are three very different issues, which should not be conflated. As most of Australia returns to school and work in February, and summer temperatures continue to rise, the risk of further blackouts make it essential to understand the cause of the blackouts, what a power station “trip” really is, and how intermittent renewable energy can be integrated into a national system. Blackouts Initial reports indicate recent blackouts in Victoria were caused by multiple small failures in the electricity distribution system across the state, affecting all but one of the five separately owned and managed systems that supply Victorians. Across the whole of mainland Australia, very hot weather causes peak levels of electricity consumption. Unfortunately, for reasons of basic physics, electricity distribution systems do not work well when it is very hot, so the combination of extreme heat and high demand is very challenging. It appears that significant parts of the Victorian electricity distribution system were unable to meet the challenge, leading to uncontrolled blackouts. Parenthetically, electricity distribution systems are vulnerable to other types of uncontrollable extreme environmental events, including high winds, lightning, and bushfires. Sometimes blackouts last only a few seconds, sometimes for days, depending on the nature and extent of the damage to the system. These blackouts are very different from those caused by power station “trips”, although they have the same effect on consumers. When electricity is insufficient to meet demand, certain sections of the grid have to be strategically blacked out to restore the balance (this is known as “load shedding”). It is the possibility of blackouts of this second type which has excited so much commentary in recent months, and has been linked to power station “trips”. What is a ‘trip’ and how significant is it? “Trip” simply means disconnect; it is used to describe the ultra-fast operation of the circuit breakers used as switching devices in high-voltage electricity transmission systems. When a generator trips, it means that it is suddenly, and usually unexpectedly, disconnected from the transmission network, and thus stops supplying electricity to consumers. The key words here are suddenly and unexpectedly. Consider what happened in Victoria on January 18 this year. It was a very hot day and all three brown coal power stations in the state were generating at near full capacity, supplying in total about 4,200 megawatts towards the end of the afternoon, as total state demand climbed rapidly past 8,000MW (excluding rooftop solar generation). Suddenly, at 4:35pm, one of the two 500MW units at Loy Yang B, Victoria’s newest (or, more precisely, least old) coal-fired power station tripped. At the time this unit was supplying 490MW, equal to about 6% of total state demand. The system, under the operational control of the Australia Energy Market Operator (AEMO), responded just as it was meant to. There was considerable spare gas generation capacity, some of which was immediately made available, as was some of the more limited spare hydro capacity. There was also a large increase in imports from New South Wales, and a smaller reduction in net exports to South Australia. By the time Loy Yang B Unit 1 was fully back on line, three hours later, Victoria had passed its highest daily peak demand for nearly two years. There was no load shedding: all electricity consumers were supplied with as much electricity as they required. However, spot wholesale prices for electricity reached very high levels during the three hours, and it appears that some large consumers, whose supply contracts exposed them to wholesale prices, made short-term reductions in discretionary demand. This (relatively) happy outcome on January 18 was made possible by the application of the system reliability rules and procedures, specified in the National Electricity Rules. These require AEMO to ensure that at all times, in each of the five state regions of the NEM, available spare generation capacity exceeds the combined capacity of the two largest units operating at any time. In other words, spare capacity must be sufficient to allow demand to continue to be reliably supplied if both of the two largest units generating should suddenly disconnect. Forecasting AEMO forecasts energy demand, and issues market notices alerting generators about reliability, demand and potential supply issues. On a busy day, like January 18, market notices may be issued at a rate of several per hour. These forecasts allowed generators to respond to the loss of Loy Yang B without causing regional blackouts. What is not publicly known, and may never be known, is why Loy Yang Unit B1 tripped. AEMO examines and reports in detail on what are called “ unusual power system events ”, which in practice means major disruptions, such as blackouts. There are usually only a few of these each year, whereas generator trips that don’t cause blackouts are much more frequent (as are similar transmission line trips). It has been widely speculated that, as Australia’s coal fired generators age, they are becoming less reliable, but that could only be confirmed by a systematic and detailed examination of all such events. Managing variable generation Finally, and most importantly, the events described above bear almost no relationship to the challenges to reliable system operation presented by the growth of wind and solar generation. With traditional thermal generation, the problems are caused by unpredictability of sudden failures, and the large unit size, especially of coal generators, which means that a single failure can challenge total system reliability. Individual wind generators may fail unpredictably, but each machine is so small that the loss of one or two has a negligible effect on reliability. The challenge with wind and solar is not reliability but the variability of their output, caused by variations in weather. This challenge is being addressed by continuous improvement of short term wind forecasting. As day-ahead and hour-ahead forecasts get better, the market advice AEMO provides will give a more accurate estimate of how much other generation will be needed to meet demand at all times. Of course, AEMO, and the generation industry, do still get caught out by sudden and unexpected drops in wind speed, but even the fastest drop in wind speed takes much longer than the milliseconds needed for a circuit breaker in a power station switchyard to trip out. At the same time, as the share of variable renewable generation grows, the complementary need for a greater share of fast response generators and energy storage technologies will also grow, while the value to the system of large, inflexible coal-fired generators will shrink.

    "date": "19-02-2018 02:44:00 PM",
    "content": "It is clear that we are in a transition to renewable and decentralised generation, and I support that transition. Through calendar 2017, electricity supply from coal-fired plant amounted to 71% of the volume of electricity produced from all sources in the NEM, including estimates from small-scale solar provided by the APVI. By 2030 most forecasts have coal still supplying a significant (if not majority) share of the electricity supply mix. Adding in supplies from gas-fired plant pushes the percentages still higher. But, despite this majority share, there has been no incentive to decrease its’ own emissions intensity since the removal of the carbon tax. On the contrary, the ongoing lack of policy certainty has delayed investment, and in some cases deferred maintenance of this fleet. Some options for reducing emissions intensity of coal-fired electricity When we look at improving the efficiency (Emissions Reduction) of a plant we look at two areas: The first is regaining efficiency lost through degradation , which is returning the plant to design. Most of the plant degradation recovery is achieved in major overhauls, the timing and extent of which, from an efficiency view, are a commercial imperative of the plant owner. For brevity let’s assume that any financial incentive will be first a driver to improve this recovery of degradation. The second, and most interesting, is selective improvements in technology that can better match the plant to its future needs . With such technology improvements we can also change the characteristics of a plant to make it more flexible in operation. Note that on very old or poorly maintained plant it may not be commercially viable to perform upgrades – I refer to the many articles on Muja A&B or Playford PS. However Hazelwood would actually be a good example of upgrades extending the life of, increasing output from, and reducing emissions on an aged plant. Let’s have a look at some of the key areas that can be improved and a practical example Boiler Advance computer aided CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) modelling, better materials and better manufacturing techniques have allowed dramatic improvement in many boiler components over the last 20 years: • Pulverisers – In mill dense mineral extraction systems can remove silicates and pyrites from coal prior to entering the furnace reducing wear and extending the efficient operation of the unit. • Upgraded mill wear components and classifiers can improve the fineness of pulverised coal having a direct effect on combustion and efficiency • Upgraded burner nozzles can reduce NOx (Nitrogen Oxides) and improve the efficiency of the boiler via reduced unburned carbon. • Combinations of Nozzles, damper, pulveriser and fan designs can improve combustion efficiency and reduce emissions. • Upgraded Flame Scanners , along with the above combinations can be used to improve “turn Down” and allow coal fired boilers to run at low loads without support oil, or on fewer mills – increasing both flexibility and efficiency . • Additional heat transfer area , can be added to water walls, superheater or re-heater to take advantage of improved turbine design and efficiencies. Providing more energy at better thermal efficiency. • Economiser surface area can be added to reduce waste heat in flue gases, or additional Low Temperature Economisers added to recover waste heat downstream of the boiler, dramatically improving efficiency. Air Pre-Heater Transfers waste heat from boiler flue gas back into the furnace increasing efficiency. • Improved basket designs allow more heat transfer improving thermal efficiency. • Improved seal designs reduce leakage losses, improving efficiency and reduce fan load increasing the electrical power available for export or increasing plant efficiency at a given load. Steam Turbine The prime mover of the power plant. Again advanced design techniques, materials and manufacturing technologies have converged to allow manufacturers to produce optimised blade profiles and seal systems resulting in improvements on output and efficiency. • High Pressure turbines – All new HP steam paths offer an Improvement in efficiency over those of even 20 years ago. Improvements are in the order of 1 per cent to Heat Rate depending on existing design. Additionally, changes to control system layout and the steam admission design can allow the particular plant to be redesigned to either offer part load efficiency or full load efficiency. • Low Pressure Turbines –The manufacture of large free standing blades of complex design and regular advances in reducing steam exhaust losses have led to dramatic improvement in LP turbine efficiency. Retrofits can be designed to deal with differences in operation profile and vacuum fluctuations. An improvement of 1-2 per cent in heat rate and a significant output increase is possible depending on the existing design. Condensers Maintaining a vacuum at the turbine exhaust is critical to both efficiency and output – opportunities are available to increase the condenser effectiveness. • Tube bundle retrofits – although costly and time consuming – retrofitting a plant with titanium tubes with greater cooling water flow rates will offer performance improvement, be more resilient to corrosion and erosion and maintain efficiency for longer periods. • Ball cleaning systems – offer a way to maintain cleanliness of condenser tubes and optimise heat transfer. Cooling Water Systems The temperature of cooling water entering the condenser is critical to condenser performance and therefore to overall plant efficiency. Note that many of our plants were designed at a time when our peak demand was in winter not summer as it is now. • Auxiliary cooling towers may be added to closed loop cooling systems to provide cooling water to the condenser at a lower approach temperature, offering increased plant efficiency and some margin at higher summer loads and ambient temperatures. Along with these structural changes there is a new frontier of data analytics and software upgrades that will play an increasing part over the next 5 years. • Advanced Control Technologies – particularly Boiler Optimisation packages offer software systems, which may be hybrids of Neural Networks and MPC (model predictive controls). These advanced control technologies analyse real time and historic data, model variables that impact combustion quality and continuously adjust control settings to optimise combustion and operation for a given objective. i.e. boiler efficiency or emissions controls. These advanced controls have the potential to increase plant efficiency by up to 1.5 per cent. Here’s an Example: Single Unit 300MWe In a recent exercise we modelled improvements to a 20 year old supercritical coal fired unit in another country. We were able to conservatively model the following improvements from upgraded components: • Upgrade air pre-heater components – 0.7 per cent HR improvement • Upgrade HP steam path – 0.7 per cent HR Improvement + additional 3-4 MW • Upgrade LP Turbine – 1.5 – 2 per cent HR improvement + additional 6-8MW • Cooling Tower optimisation – 1 per cent HR improvement. A 4 per cent improvement in Heat Rate as outlined above will deliver a reduction in emissions of 84,000 tonnes CO2 per year based on this unit load cycle, or an additional 10 Megawatts of energy for the same emissions level – that is 10 MW of zero carbon additional energy. This 10 MW is the equivalent of 35MW of solar field or 30 MW of wind generation – however it is both dispatchable and high availability. If we apply similar logic to our entire coal fired fleet we would expect to deliver: • 5 – 7 million tonnes less carbon emissions per year for the same generation; or • 1000 MW of additional capacity for the same emissions. Coal will be part of our generation mix for many years to come. The existing large synchronous generators provide the dispatchable, high availability and affordable energy required to meet the requirements of our modern lifestyles. They will provide stability and security whilst our system transitions to decentralised, renewable or low emissions generation. It may sound like a contradiction that by considering thermal plants as part of the solution, and encouraging investment in that solution we will be able to affect a faster, more orderly transition to renewable energy sources. But that is the case. Upgrading our existing coal thermal fleet to increase efficiency and flexibility is, in my view, the most cost-effective opportunity to add dispatchable capacity and lower the overall carbon intensity of our electricity sector. Would the NEG be a vehicle to achieve this? The National Energy Guarantee (‘NEG’) concept has now been around for several months giving us some time to consider its implications and opportunities. The NEG proposes to be energy agnostic – to the extent that regulation will not define how much energy is derived from renewables versus thermal, as long as it achieves a specified emissions intensity and reliability. As such, the NEG might (subject to the detailed design work still to be completed) provide for the additional low or zero emissions energy that is available from our current installed base of thermal plant (I’ve not considered new plant here, as my interest is how to maximise our existing assets). It makes sense that, under the NEG, there will be a premium paid for additional zero or low emissions generation from our existing plants equivalent to that paid for new renewable generation. We’ve primarily looked at efficiency or emissions reduction here, flexibility (or dispatchabilty) is definitely worth another article.

    "content": "Forecasts don’t always pan out but the AEMO’s forecast for Queensland’s Scheduled Demand to exceed 9,000 MW on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday this week has borne out. The Scheduled demand in Queensland peaked at 9,924 MW at 16:50 this afternoon, 316MW more than yesterday’s peak. While the peak was not as late in the day as Tuesday, as I write this post at 7:30 PM the Scheduled Demand in Queensland is still over 9,400 MW. While we’re talking about demand … We have spent some time in the office over the summer months discussing demand. More specifically how are the different demand values that are published calculated and what can be inferred from the different calculations? Most of these discussions were prompted by the development of the new version of the RenewEconomy Live Supply and Demand widget and how to best represent demand in the NEM. The inclusion of “AEMO Operational Demand” and “Demand the AEMO don’t see” in the widget has prompted some great feedback from the users of the widget and confirmed for us that what demand means is not always clear. We decided today in our planning meeting that in future when using the term demand in our products or in any form of communication we should always qualify what demand value we are referencing. It might take some time to filter into all of our products but since our goal is to make the energy market clearer the effort will not be wasted. … AEMO 30 min Operational Demand data in NEMreview v7 and our Trend Editor in ez2view. The AEMO have been using their Operational Demand value when tweeting about the peak demand in Queensland this week. Prompted by a request from a customer, AEMO Operational Demand data is now available in our trend products, NEMreview v7 and ez2view Trend Editor.

    "title": "Queensland region sees a new record peak Scheduled Demand – at 18:50 on Monday 12th February",
    "date": "12-02-2018 09:38:00 PM",
    "content": "Well, we knew it would be hot across Queensland this week, and hence last Friday AEMO had indicated the likelihood of high demand (particularly on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) . With our NEM-Watch v10 entry-level dashboard we’ve been keeping a close eye on how the Scheduled Demand had been performing through today. By the time I had left the office today I’d seen the old record eclipsed by a handful of megawatts (9,482MW at 16:55 – eclipsing the old record by 5MW). Hence I’d gone home noting that I’d have to make a quick post this evening marking something of some interest, but not astounding . However checking back in at 20:55 with the temperature still stubbornly high, I am amazed to see that the new record for Scheduled Demand is actually 73MW higher than what we saw in January 2017. That’s an impressive increase on a prior record (especially given we know a number of large users which have backed off consumption because of volatility experienced in prior summers). What’s particularly staggering is that this demand record was how late this was achieved. Peak Scheduled Demand was 9,550MW at 18:50 today! My sense (I have not checked comprehensively, yet) is that this is much later than any prior peak demand record (for instance the prior record of 9,477MW was set at 17:00 on 18th January 2017). Taking a snapshot from NEM-Watch v10 at 20:55 I have converted the demand and supply widgets to show tabular view and annotated with two significant take-aways: As noted in the image, the fact that this record in demand arrived almost 2 hours later than it happened just last summer could signal a huge change for the Queensland region – because, at 18:50 local time: 1) Many businesses will have already packed up for the day and so the commercial contribution to peak demand will already have waned! 2) It’s also late enough that the contribution from solar PV has dropped to zero . Now I have been watching the peak Scheduled Demand shift later in the day because of the “duck curve” phenomenon (and have previously posted about this a number of times ). It’s still startling when it actually happens, though, when peak demand shifts so far to the right on the time scale that solar contribution is nothing. This is a remarkable development that will lead to some more head scratching – about firstly forecasting peaks in Scheduled Demand in future years, and secondly in actually meeting them. Notable in its absence today… One thing noticeable in its absence in Queensland today (and indeed across the whole of summer, to date) has been the (also stunning) lack of price volatility . A very different situation that that seen in the past 4-5 summers, from memory. … but wait, there’s more (probably) coming this week As a brief detour before hitting “publish” I dial up the pre-configured 14-day overview for the Queensland region that’s been configured in the Time Series Editor within ez2view and see (as noted) that the AEMO is forecasting more of the same tomorrow (Tuesday 13th) with an even higher peak in demand forecast for Wednesday 14th February.

    "content": "Alerts from NEM-Watch and ez2view yesterday evening alerted me to an AEMO Market Notice, indicating a reduction in available capacity that was expected to be of the order of 1,400MW across Loy Yang A and Loy Yang B for a 6-hour period last night. Here’s the text of the Market Notice: Given the growing interest in the electricity sector (especially due to this multi-faceted energy transition we’re undertaking, with part of it being growing accessibility of market data – something we appreciate the opportunity to assist with in a number of ways), it was not really a surprise when this made social media ( Twitter and elsewhere). Also not a surprise to see these sorts of announcements grow a life of their own, driven by different agendas of those involved. This morning, with the benefit of generator bids being published till 04:00 today, we’re able to see a little more of what this actually meant in this snapshot from ez2view : In this trend, we see trended bid stacks for the combination of Loy Yang B and Loy Yang A and note that, whilst the Market Notice talked about a reduction in output across the two stations, we see that two things happened: 1) Available generation was only reduced by 420MW across all 6 units; whilst 2) 960MW of additional capacity was still offered to the market, but at a higher price. Given the price offered (>$300/MWh), it was unlikely this would be called on overnight, so the AEMO dispatched the output of the 6 units in aggregate down by that combined amount (i.e. 1,380MW). Important to note that whatever repair work was required was completed overnight, as AEMO had indicated, and the units are all back up around full load.",

    "title": "Victorian demand rises above 9,000MW – which (in combination with other factors) leads to a volatile day in the southern regions",
    "date": "07-02-2018 09:33:00 PM",
    "content": "A quick post to bookmark a day where Victorian demand (Scheduled, and Operational) peaked above 9,000MW and NEM-wide demand rose above the 30,000MW mark. This high demand in the south, coupled with a only just enough available generation capacity* (and the unfortunate coincidence of low wind harvest) delivered a tight supply/demand balance which was the main driving factor delivering quite a volatile afternoon in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. * keep in mind that the demand (whilst 1,400MW or so below the all-time maximum in Victoria) also comes after the closure of Hazelwood station (1,600MW capacity approx). That’s one of the reasons why the effect is similar as might have been seen a year ago with much higher peak demand Here’s a snapshot taken this evening from a Web Trend Widget from ez2view (coming soon to clients of ez2view, and perhaps also to some websites near you, as live updating trends): In this image, we can clearly see how the demand (just in Victoria grew over 2,000MW from Monday to Wednesday, primarily on the basis of the rise in temperatures in the main population centres*). * Note we have shown Morwell in addition to Melbourne here, as high temperatures in the Latrobe Valley will temporarily affect the maximum output , and the efficiency , of the 3 remaining brown coal plant there (though I am somewhat confused by claims made by others that the high temperatures somehow affect reliability . Some of our more learned engineer/readers might help explain to me how that happens?). We know that demand on weekends is lower, but we see here the demand shape on Monday is significantly below that of Wednesday, with temperature being the main difference between the two days – illustrating the peak demand challenge the electricity supply industry has grappled with for decades (perhaps as long as 100 years). Some readers will remember that they can use the NEM-Watch Consumption Widget, sponsored by Energy Consumers Australia to watch the correlation unfold in real time. On social media this afternoon I posted this snapshot of 15:50 NEM time from NEM-Watch v10 (note v11 under development, ask us if you want to know more) that shows some of the kaleidoscope of price colours we witnessed through the day: As highlighted in the image, the VIC+SA “Economic Island” formed because of constrained interconnector flow had dropped to 1,153MW only spare “Available Generation” capacity at this point, hence the red warning (which also explains the AEMO issuing an LOR1 Low Reserve Notice for the afternoon). *** The following part of my original note was INCORRECT , see below *** However: note the Available Generation totals for each region includes capacity bid “available” by semi-scheduled plant (which are just wind farms in VIC and SA, for now) but which are energy constrained (not capacity constrained, which would affect Available Generation) because of low wind speeds. as a result the actual spare capacity available to supply to the market under today’s conditions would have been significantly below this. A truer picture will only emerge after 04:00 tomorrow when today’s bids are publicly available, and we can see what spare capacity existed at plant that could actually supply in the circumstances. Unfortunately won’t have time to look tomorrow. CORRECTION – some of our more learned readers pointed out the error to me in the above understanding, in that the AEMO (via AWEFS and ASEFS) does already mark down the availability of the Semi-Scheduled plants in their region aggregate predispatch forecasts. Apologies that I had overlooked that one. Take away from this is that the spare Available Generation figures, and calculated IRPM seen in real time, and in the predispatch forecasts, are more accurate than I had implied above. I’ll post more about this later. *** Ends bit in error *** However readers should keep in mind the genuinely tight supply/demand balance today before running off on other tangents about other potential reasons why prices were so high today….",

Schools are back in full flight this week, and I was just commenting to another parent this afternoon/evening at a school event (he also works in the industry) that the Queensland demand had not peaked above 9,000MW so far this summer – however I get home to see email alerts triggered by NEM-Watch v10 telling me that I had spoken too soon, because the Scheduled Demand in Queensland passed 9,000MW today ( to 9,072MW in the 16:40 dispatch interval ) – as helpfully recorded in the following NEM-Watch snapshot at the time: Given our keen interest in watching the NEM in our various dashboard products ( NEM-Watch as general entry-level, plus more specific tools for different types of clients) I was pretty sure that the demand had not reached those levels so far this summer, but it was easy to generate the following trend in NEMreview v7 online, so I did to double check: Turns out that (at least in this instance) my recollection was correct ( NEMreview clients can access the updated trend here as summer, and Q1, progresses to see how demand levels evolve) . I’ve flagged in the image here a couple of other occasions (26th December, 1st January and 14th January) where temperatures were about as high as today, but demand levels not so high (because of the “summer holiday factor”). With curiosity driving me a little further, but at the same time running out of time tonight, I quickly pulled up our own residential consumption from 2nd December in our Solar Analytics dashboard (thanks guys – note that technical limitations mean I can’t show daily data for a longer range – seems to be limited to 61 days) to generate this trend: Frequent readers will remember that I posted some personal musings about our own rooftop solar learning experience on 7th November . On this mash-up chart here, I’ve noted the peak consumption days over the range, and am interested to note that they don’t completely correlate to the 3 days noted above when daily peak temperature in Archerfield was highest. Of course other factors will have been at work (e.g. were we home much during those hotter days, for starters), but at face value this is a good illustration of the complexities involved in electricity demand. One final comment before signing off, tonight – electricity prices in Queensland today have been very subdued (as with summer, to date). Today the highest dispatch price also correlated with the highest demand in the above snapshot at only $120/MWh – which would have been thought highly unlikely beforehand, given prior summer experiences in recent times…",

    "title": "If I were going to perform an objective review of what happened last Thursday 18th and Friday 19th, here’s a couple things I would look into…",
    "date": "22-01-2018 10:05:00 PM",
    "content": "As it does every year, summer arrived in December with all the predictable accompaniments – including: high temperatures driving both high demand for electricity and (because of the underlying weather patterns) physical limitations on pretty much all pieces of the energy infrastructure chains (thermal plant, wind farms, solar PV, hydro, batteries, networks etc…); coupled with a healthy drive by market participants to earn their return for the year. In parallel, we’ve been been blessed with a plethora of sporting contests to keep us entertained over the long break, whilst we cogitate about the future; but (sadly) we’ve also seen a recurrence of shouting matches – and I’m not talking about with hot-headed tennis players, but rather the never-ending and inane “your technology solution is not as good as mine” arguments. On the transition to 1st January 2018, I did make a New Year’s Wish that we might see more objective, rational thought about the vexed challenges facing us in this multi-faceted energy transition (knowing full well that the range of Villains lined up against us makes it quite improbable that this can be achieved in any form of optimal way). However some very blinkered commentary I have seen from Thursday last week leads me to be even more despondent that we have the maturity to manage our way through this – so much so that I am reminded to pen a note flagging that those at the Extremes of the Emotion-o-meter are Villain #3 in their own right . One of our guest authors, Allan O’Neil, has made a great start today by highlighting earlier some of the factors contributing to the high priced outcomes seen last Thursday and Friday (noting as well the important distinction between a tight supply/demand balance, which we expect to see from time to time, and a “lights are about to go out” calamity). I don’t have much time to explore further (in part because the system largely worked as intended (i.e. as a sum-of-parts), so to some extent this is “much ado about nothing”), but just wanted to flag a couple other things I would want to explore further to provide a fully objective view of what happened last week: 1) Let’s look at how weather patterns affected all the technology options On Monday morning I saw some comments on social media expressing concerns for this weekend in South Australia when the temperature is forecast to have climbed again – hence I opened this trend for the South Australian region in the ez2view Time-Series Data Viewer ( licensed users can see a live update for this trend here ): Having quickly seen (as expected) that demand (both Scheduled and Operational) are forecast to be higher, but not extreme on the weekend, my eye was magnetically drawn to the historical side, and the strong inverse correlation between the blue line and the green line , with: Blue line = aggregate Available Generation across all registered generators in South Australia (no matter what technology type); and Green line = 5-minute dispatch price in South Australia in a historical basis. With a significant portion of the Australian Energy Twitterverse clearly highlighting the role of a 500MW-odd drop in available generation capacity in Victoria as a result of the Loy Yang B trip (and being the inquisitive data junkie that I am), I powered up the older NEM-Review v6 software for a change to explore more disaggregated data for South Australia. The following chart has resulted: Because it did not take much time, I also threw together the same view for Victoria: As highlighted in the two charts, there are clearly multiple factors combining to contribute to the price outcomes over both days. Here’s some for starters keeping in mind that these charts look only at available capacity : 1a) Unit trip at Loy Yang B Unit 1 (approx 520MW reduction) Many others have commented on this, and the effect of the trip is obvious. Yes, the trip had a big effect on the prices seen on Thursday – but, no, it was not the only factor at work. The fact that prices were also up on Friday should be a pretty big give-away that it was more than just a unit trip that contributed to the high prices. Anyone who does not acknowledge that there were a number of significant factors is: analytically incompetent (especially when it comes to the complexities of an interconnected complex system); or using emotion rather than logic, or deliberately misleading you. A key question I have that I have not seen any answer to is “What caused the trip?” . Clearly (as the unit was back online in a relatively short space of time) it was not some catastrophic major plant “failure” (a much overused term), but I am particularly interested to know: whether the heat actually played a role in some way (as distinct from the assumptions that seem to being made by others because of coincidence); and I am also keenly interested to understand if there are some impacts of changes in operating regimes and maintenance practices I posted about back in 2014 and which seems to be the underlying assumption between the Australia Institute’s “outage watch” service. Given that the unit was back online quickly, I suspect not in this case . However it is a very important question still to explore (before jumping to too many conclusions, I might add). 1b) Aggregate Brown Coal availability drop in VIC on Friday (300MW reduction) Friday saw fairly similar temperatures in Victoria (at least in Melbourne), as noted in the same sort of trended chart for Victoria from the ez2view Time Series Data Viewer (which clients can access here in a live updating format ): We know that ambient temperature affects the maximum capabilities of thermal generators (refer the “Carnot cycle” if you don’t know why). Hence we wonder if the somewhat higher temperatures on Friday in Morwell (i.e. Latrobe Valley airport) were enough to lead to some slight de-rating of the capacity of some coal units noted in the NEM-Review chart for Victoria. No time to check, at the present moment, but important. 1c) Aggregate availability of wind also significantly affected (down 1,500MW on Thursday, and down “only” 800MW on Friday from a lower base) Another group of commentators (notably including our Federal Minister who should be responsible for providing leadership in guiding this energy transition ( not that he’s the only politician falling short of my expectations ) ) have latched onto the very material drop in wind availability across Victoria and South Australia on both Thursday and Friday. Yes, the significant drop in wind availability across Victoria and South Australia had a big effect on the prices seen on both Thursday and Friday – but, no, it was not the only factor at work. In the same way I noted above, anyone who does not acknowledge that there were a number of significant factors is: analytically incompetent (especially when it comes to the complexities of an interconnected complex system); or using emotion rather than logic, or deliberately misleading you. The fact that we have 2 separate groups of people, each obsessively focusing on one particular contributing factor (seemingly to the exclusion of all others) is quite bizarre – and not helpful, in terms of helping with this energy transition. 1d) Slight reductions in available generation at gas-fired plant We saw above (1b) that there was a reduction in available capacity across Victoria’s brown coal fleet most noticeably on Friday. There were also reductions in the available capacity of gas-fired generation in SA and VIC, but this does not seem to be to the same extent. Still well worth further analysis, though. 1e) A drop in availability at the Hornsdale battery on Friday Also highlighted in the chart above is a drop in the availability of the battery on Friday. Whilst this does not seem large enough to have had any material effect on market outcomes last week, it is well worth further investigation given that we’re going to be increasingly counting on battery storage in the years ahead. We know, for instance, that batteries are generally affected by high temperatures – but have no understanding of what played a role in the small drop in capability shown last Friday. 1f) Effects of network outages and trips In a snapshot from NEM-Watch v10 that I posted on Thursday to highlight that it was more than one factor involved, I flagged the trip of a transmission line within Victoria: The AEMO Market Notice read: “Non-credible contingency event – VIC region – Thursday, 18 January 2018 At 1519 hrs the following Transmission equipment tripped in the Victoria region. Rowville No2 500 kV Busbar Rowville No2 500 /220 kV Transformer Rowville – South Morang No3 500 kV line opened at South Morang AEMO did not instruct load shedding. AEMO has not been advised of any disconnection of bulk electrical load. The cause of this non credible contingency event is not known at this stage.” Somewhat confusingly, the market notice was published at 16:20 NEM time, which would be 61 minutes after the trip if the time noted in the notice was correct. It would also be 10 minutes or so before the trip of the Loy Yang B unit 1. I have not had time to dig any further than that. We know that transmission system configurations (and outages – planned and unplanned) can have significant impacts on market outcomes. If time permitted, it would be worth exploring this further. 1g) Other considerations with supply-side infrastructure No doubt there are others, in addition to those noted above. 2) Let’s also look at how the Supply-side behaved In his article on Monday, Allan highlighted some bidding behaviour by AGL at Torrens , and also noted how Alinta (as new owners of Loy Yang B) could probably have been hurt by the unexpected loss of capacity at a time of such volatility. There are more than two supply-side participants in this market, hence an objective analysis would delve into how all of the various participants had behaved in offering their capacity to the market. Note that (to be objective, and also because we expect to see significant growth in these types of approaches as the energy transition continues) we would need to extend this analysis even down to the smaller participants in the market , ensuring that (wherever possible) the similar standards of analysis applied. For instance, I saw a number of popular tweets from the guys at energy-sector start-up Reposit talking about the cash their clients received from assisting at times of peak pricing. Wanting to learn more about how this program actually works, I landed on this page by their retail partner, Diamond Energy , noting that the customer would receive “Grid Credits” to the tune of $1/kWh for energy pumped back into the grid from a Reposit-controlled (and presumably Diamond-triggered) battery on the customer’s premises. Note, however, that the customer gets $1/kWh (or $1,000/MWh) whereas the spot price spiked to over $10,000/MWh on a couple of occasions: There’s clearly a big gap! Now running a software company in the energy sector myself I am well aware of the challenges of meeting significant fixed costs in a business, and the way different business models can be used in order to deliver this. At first glance I think Reposit and Diamond Energy have very valid reasons to “only” share 10% of the benefit they gain from exporting from “captive” batteries during the super-peak prices. I highlight this example, however, to (hopefully) give some readers a moment to pause and wonder how this story might be reported if the company posting the tweet was one of the big, bad, gentailers – in which case I’d almost guarantee that there would be articles written about “Greedy Energy Company steals 90% of the benefits of residential energy user’s exports”. As it is, Reposit is congratulated by many for persevering with the development of a business model that provides some benefit to the residential energy user at the same time of assisting in managing the supply/demand balance. I am with those who congratulate them. At the same time, however, I also look forward to the day where other competitors step in and find other ways to share more of the benefits with the residential energy users. That’s what a competitive market should deliver (something which seems to be under some threat in some corners). I’m sure than an objective review of participant behaviour over this period would yield worthwhile observations relevant to this ongoing energy transition. 3) Let’s look at how the Demand Side operated It takes two hands to clap – and, likewise, the operation of the demand side (both what we do as consumers, and what we don’t do) is very important in delivering the outcomes we see in the wholesale market, and thereon into the retail market. In Allan’s earlier analysis on Monday , he combined demand in Victoria and South Australia to illustrate that the demand level was reasonably high (for this summer) but still a fair way below the historical peaks experienced in prior summers. These high demand levels clearly have an impact on the price outcomes achieved. We know that NEM-wide demand was higher on Friday than on Thursday. Just as the actual demand levels are important in the price levels achieved, so too are expectations of demand levels – as this is what many stakeholders respond to in making capacity available (or putting other measures in place) for the day. I’ve noted before about how I am very sympathetic of those whose responsibility it is to produce the forecasts that must be integral to the way supply & demand is balanced (and the market operates efficiently) . The difficulties are due, at least in part, to the fact that any model’s just a model, it’s not reality . Yet we need them all the same. With the “Forecast Convergence” widget in ez2view , we have the ability to look at how each of AEMO’s successive forecasts for a range of variables converged onto ‘reality’ (i.e. what actually turned out happening). The following image has been captured focused on Scheduled Demand in Victoria, time-travelled back to 17:00 on Friday 19th January (i.e. just towards the end of the volatile period): As highlighted on the chart, we see early forecasts (a week ahead) for Friday grossly underestimated what the demand would be, but forecasts closer to the date correctly factored in the heat. Indeed, the forecast run at 10:00 on the day saw the demand peak forecast for 16:00 step up considerably, but then back down after the 14:00 forecast run. As noted on the chart, the first major price spike was in the 14:00 dispatch interval – this would have presumably triggered a fair amount of price-enabled market demand response (though the exact amount is impossible for anyone to truly know). We hypothesise that it would only be at this point that AEMO would be able to factor the DR into the demand forecast (given it is an outcome from the price discovery process for a DI, not an input ). This seems to be a worthwhile note of caution to seeing everything through the prism of “demand forecast error”. What I did not note for the demand shape on Thursday (though it is very visible), was that the actual demand seemed to run longer than forecast (i.e. like a heat stuck around later that day, or for some other reason). There’s plenty more we could analyse in order to gain a truly objective view of what actually happened on Thursday and Friday last week. However I have run out of time, and really do need to get back to some particular client commitments tomorrow. There are clearly a number of different (and interrelated) factors at play. As noted above, anyone purporting to say that it’s all due to one particular factor (trip of Loy Yang B1, lack of wind, or something else) should be treated with a healthy dose of scepticism.",

    "title": "Some perspectives on events last Thursday and Friday",
    "date": "22-01-2018 01:53:00 PM",
    "content": "Reading the weekend’s press clippings – or worse still following debates on Twitter – it appears that the most rapidly growing segments in the energy sector are instant experts and misleading factoids. At least Trump is yet to weigh in. Too much happened in the spot market’s South Australian and Victorian regions last Thursday and Friday to attempt a full chronology or analysis here, so this post will highlight a few key aspects of the two days, based as ever on what the market data shows. (Lack of) Reserves – What Do They Actually Mean? Some overall impression of developing events is apparent in a simple list of AEMO’s Market Notices dealing with system reserves in Victoria and South Australia across the two days, drawn from ez2view : The general press in particular get quite excited by these notices, seemingly without fully appreciating their content and context. As a quick reminder, “reserve” is the headroom or spare capacity between demand and available supply, and the working meaning of the different Lack of Reserve (LOR) conditions advised by AEMO is essentially: LOR1 – available supply exceeds demand, and there is enough spare capacity to withstand loss of the largest supply source (eg the largest online generating unit) without load shedding, but not enough to withstand loss of the two largest supply sources. LOR2 – available supply exceeds demand, but loss of the largest supply source would require load shedding to maintain supply-demand balance. LOR3 – available supply is insufficient to meet demand so load shedding is required to maintain balance. So a shortfall in reserves – unless it’s the LOR3 variety – does not mean that “there is not enough power available to meet demand” as the press might breathlessly report, it means that the amount of spare capacity in the system is, or is forecast to be, less than would be needed to sustain one (LOR2) or two (LOR1) contingencies . But that’s more of a mouthful and more difficult to explain than “not enough power”! It’s also important to distinguish between actual LORx and forecast LORx conditions. Clearly an actual LOR3 condition would mean that load shedding is currently taking place. Not good. But a forecast LOR3 condition would mean that based on current forecasts of demand and available supply , load shedding would be required at some future time. Like all forecasts, this is based on uncertain and changing information about the future so may or may not come to pass. It’s apparent from the list above that most of the Lack of Reserve notices published by AEMO deal with forecast LOR conditions. AEMO has obligations under the market rules to continuously monitor the forecast level of system reserves and notify the market whenever a potential lack of reserve condition is forecast. In large part this is to encourage market participants to make more supply available to the market, but in the case of forecast LOR2 and LOR3 conditions, AEMO can intervene in the market, for example by issuing directions or triggering RERT contracts it may hold (more on this later if time permits). It should be obvious why LOR2 conditions are the threshold for AEMO to act – leaving the system without the headroom to sustain sudden loss of its largest generating unit without load shedding wouldn’t be prudent. Market Outcomes on Thursday and Friday Jan 18-19 To a large extent Victoria and South Australia behaved as one combined region over the two days, with supply from NSW and Tasmania flowing in across constrained interconnectors, but flows between Vic and SA being unconstrained for many of the key periods. This is reflected in the price outcomes in the two regions following each other quite closely in the chart below: For this reason I’ve plotted combined Vic + SA demand and combined supply availability rather than individual state totals. There are two lines representing supply availability on this chart, one being generation within the two states, and the second adding to this actual flows on the interconnectors from adjoining regions (hence this being less than available generation during the low demand overnight periods when exports often flow to NSW and Tasmania out of the Vic / SA region.) We can get some perspective on the level of demand reached across the two states last week by looking back at previous summers’ maximum demand levels for the combined region: At just over 12,000 MW (reached at 7pm AEDT on Thursday), last week’s maximum for “Operational Demand” (as well as scheduled demand, this measure includes supply from large non-scheduled generation, principally older windfarms) was higher than in recent years, but still well below historic maximums reached in the 2006/7 to 2013/14 period. But supply from rooftop PV is now much greater than it was 10 or even 5 years ago, and is not counted in the Operational Demand, so I’ve used AEMO’s estimates of rooftop PV output to calculate what grid demand would have been without that PV supply, yielding a maximum of just under 13,000 MW, which is more comparable with previous highs. So despite not being fully out of the summer holiday season, last week’s was clearly a relatively high demand event. Loy Yang B1 Trip As shown in the annotations on the market outcomes chart, and fairly widely reported at the time and over the weekend, a unit at Loy Yang B tripped suddenly from 528 MW at about 4:30pm AEDT on Thursday (3:30pm NEM time). Obviously the system physically sustained that sudden loss – as it’s designed to, with a range of frequency control ancillary services kicking in – but within half an hour 5 minute dispatch prices rose to $9,999.81/MWh in Victoria and over $11,000/MWh in South Australia. ez2view ’s Price Setter widget shows that prices in both regions were being set by Jeeralang gas turbine units in Victoria, with the higher price in South Australia reflecting losses across the Heywood interconnector. Subsequently, dispatch prices in South Australia reached the Market Price Cap of $14,200/MWh, set by bids at Torrens Island Power Station (TIPS) and stayed close to this level until the tripped unit at Loy Yang B was returned to service and restored output over about an hour from 6:15pm AEDT. Torrens Island Bidding With many of the highest prices across Thursday and Friday being set by bids from AGL’s Torrens Island, it’s worth looking more closely at the bidding behaviour of the largest participant in the South Australian market. The Bid Stack view in ez2view shows the station’s bids over the two days: One notable thing here is the “hard boundary” between capacity priced at the MPC (the green bid band) and that priced below $600/MWh (all the other bid bands with offered volume greater than zero MW). This pattern of bids with very little volume offered between ~$1,000/MWh and ~$10,000/MWh has become very common in the NEM over the last few years. Exporting the bid data, simplifying it into just two “high” (MPC) and “low” (sub-$600/MWh) price bands, and overlaying dispatch targets and price outcomes shows output levels from TIPS across the two days and how these related to periods with the highest price outcomes – interestingly TIPS had more undispatched capacity offered at the market price cap during the periods of highest prices than it did in some nearby time periods where prices were lower Overall this illustrates that whilst prices reached the MPC on both days, there were still material volumes of available generation undispatched (at both TIPS and other generators across Vic and SA) AGL, and other generators with undispatched capacity, were presumably financially comfortable with spot prices reaching these levels – if not they could have rebid that capacity to lower prices. Conversely there would have been other participants negatively exposed to these high prices – it’s quite possible that Thursday’s trip at Loy Yang B may have been relatively costly for its new owner Alinta. But without knowing details of any participants’ hedging contract and retail positions, this is simply speculation. In Summary Plenty more could be drawn from the market outcomes, data, and behaviour seen last week. Despite some of the overhype in the press, Thursday’s and Friday’s market outcomes are not unprecedented and did not represent a system completely on the precipice of failure. But with extreme heat in most of NSW today and more forecast for the southern states later this week – although fortunately (from a power market perspective) falling across the long weekend – the summer is far from over.

    "content": "As noted here yesterday , at 17:00 yesterday the AEMO announced (via Market Notice) its intention to possibly dispatch Reserve Trader into the market, and hence trigger Intervention Pricing. Today turned out to be quite an interesting (and challenging) ride. Through the day I posted a number of images on Twitter here which I’m not going to copy into this post (so refer to the link if you want to see more). As one of a number of developments in the market, at 13:43 today the AEMO announced (again via a Market Notice, which is copied in the following image mash-up (combination of NEM-Watch and ez2view screenshots) that the Reserve Trader Contracts were activated: In the Market Notice AEMO indicated to watch constraints with an identifier or “#RT_VIC”, and we did with the “Constraint Equations” widget within ez2view . However we did not see anything – hence suggesting that AEMO did not actually have to dispatch any response (though it will have incurred costs for having it on standby because of the Availability payments). We might have time to dig more next week, but just want to also flag that (at 16:25) the AEMO had to add another layer of complexity into the mix, in limiting flows west on Heywood (i.e. VIC to SA) to provide more of a buffer in the SA region resulting from the BOM’s Severe Weather Warning for the state. This is one of the measures implemented following the Blackout of September 2016 (an occasion where additional headroom on the interconnector might have been enough to provide a bigger kick when the wind farms simultaneously tripped out to avoid the system black). Thankfully the cool change has come through Victoria at this point, meaning that levels of Scheduled Demand had begun turning out lower than the AEMO had initially forecast them to be – as shown in the snapshot here from ez2view : More later, if time permits…",

    "content": "I’ve been offline a couple days and have tuned back in this afternoon to forecasts of extreme temperatures across several spots later this week. I see Adelaide’s already hot, with the forecast for the heat to remain and build through Thursday and Friday: As noted on the image, consecutive days of hot weather have more effect on electricity demand – partly because of physical properties (like thermal mass in buildings), but also because of the psychological factors (i.e. “screw it, I’m turning the air-con on because I can’t take it any more”). Hence we’d expect to see demand in South Australia highest on Friday, if these predictions turn out to be correct. In Melbourne I see that the forecast is for the heat to build to Friday (from a lower start today) with a cool change coming through sometime Friday night: Given that we have access to the popular NEM-Watch v10 entry-level dashboard to the NEM, it’s easy for me to have a quick look at what might be seen from this window into the NEM – with the following snapshot taken at 18:00 NEM time (so 18:30 in Adelaide DST and 19:00 in Melbourne DST): I’ve annotated with a couple points: 1) We see demand currently in South Australia up in the yellow zone 2) We see tomorrow that the NEM-wide Scheduled Demand is only forecast to peak up at 30,034MW in the 17:00 trading period (this is about 5,500MW below the all-time record and really not too noteworthy for a summer’s day). I see that the forecast is for Scheduled Demand in Victoria to rise tomorrow to about 8,600MW at 16:30 (almost 2,000MW below all-time max) and in South Australia to 2,800MW later at 18:30 (about 600MW below the all-time max) 3) However I also know that there are supply-side considerations as well: 3a) I remember that since last summer Hazelwood has closed, and Northern also went in South Australia a while before that – hence the portfolio of dispatchable generation has reduced. 3b) Unfortunately, we see that the current wind harvest from all wind farms across the NEM is quite low today (ranging between 200MW and 400MW through much of today), and I wonder what the forecast is for the next couple days. 3c) As an aside (because they cannot be known in advance), I also have seen that the Australia Institute has been flagging unit trips at thermal stations in more recent times, and wonder whether the forced outage rate and availability figures are significantly different than that seen in past years (remembering my prior “clapped out second hand car” analogy in speaking to concerns about reducing availabilities, and making a mental note to look into this further when time permits). 4) Hence it’s not really too much of a surprise then to see that the current predispatch forecast is for prices to spike in SA, VIC and also TAS up above $10,000/MWh (all 3 regions for 16:30 and 17:00 trading periods, NEM time). 5) I’ve highlighted the Market Notices AEMO has issued indicating the least severity “Lack of Reserve” notices (i.e. LOR1 level) for both Thursday and Friday in Victoria. Opening up a pre-prepared template trend from the ez2view Time Series Data Viewer (which clients can access themselves here ) I see that the peak in demand in Victoria tomorrow is forecast to reach the sum of available generation capacity (meaning that Victoria will be heavily dependent on imports from neighbouring regions (which we presume will be NSW, given SA will also be feeling its own heat). As a quick last look at one of the factors mentioned above, I’ve used the “Forecast Convergence” widget within ez2view to look at how AEMO’s successive forecasts for aggregate wind output across Victoria have been varying – with particular interest in looking forward for the coming couple of days, and at times of peak Scheduled Demand: As a later addition, I have included the same chart but looking at aggregate wind in South Australia tomorrow – and, unfortunately we also see more recent AEMO forecasts (to 20:30 on Wednesday 17th) are for there to be not much contribution at all from wind at the time of peak Scheduled Demand, which (at 18:30 as above) will be when there will be not much small-scale solar PV injection as well: We’ll watch with interest tomorrow and Friday…",

    "title": "Friday 12th January saw high instantaneous wind output in South Australia (but not quite a new record)",
    "date": "13-01-2018 09:32:00 PM",
    "content": "Sheltering from the heat and humidity in Queensland today I noticed this nice use of our upgraded RenewEconomy-sponsored NEMwatch “Supply and Demand Widget” yesterday (Friday 12th January 2018 – a windy day in South Australia): The author of the tweet noted that the aggregate output from wind farms in South Australia was running up at 1,598MW at 07:40 NEM time on the day (so 08:20 Adelaide Daylight Savings Time). They noted that it was the most they’d ever seen – which made me wonder what the actual peak for output is these days (given the development of new wind farms it is expected that output will continue growing, hence new records being set). So having NEMreview v7 open already, I quickly put this chart together to show a couple of things: 1) The peak output on Friday was very close to the all-time record, but not quite (with that occurring on Tuesday 19th December 2017 with a peak of 1,618MW ). 2) We see the highest average output still occurred over a number of days of winter 2017 (with the remarkable exception of June 2017 where the wind consistently went missing for these reasons ). 3) I’ve also flagged Monday 28th August 2017 as a day of consistently high prices (averaging above $300/MWh over the day) partially as a result of the absence of wind on that day, with the maximum output on that day being only around 240MW.

    "date": "13-01-2018 08:28:00 PM",
    "content": "A quick post this evening with the temperatures and humidity still uncomfortably sticking around to have a quick look at what we can see quickly through some of our software products after a day that saw (amazingly) only the first major price spikes of summer 2017-18 in the QLD region . (A) Recapping Saturday 13th January 2018 As a starting point, let’s start with the obligatory snapshot from NEM-Watch v10 (our entry-level dashboard to the NEM) from 19:50 NEM time (which is 19:50 in Brisbane): Experimenting with the early-release beta of our NEMreview v7 software (which clients have been benefiting from for many months ) I was able to put the following chart together looking back over the past 24 hours: NEMreview clients who wish to access this chart can do so through the template linked here – just log in with your individualised access. I’ve noted in the image the two most significant price spikes that occurred on the day (though note that prices were elevated throughout the day, as noted in the NEMwatch image above): 1) At 12:15 the QLD dispatch price spiked to $14,200/MWh (the Market Price Cap for the 2017-18 financial year); and 2) At 16:15 the QLD dispatch price spiked to $9,814.20/MWh . These two spikes were (amazingly!) the first major price spikes in the Queensland region this summer . The other mainland regions have been similarly subdued, though Tassie has seen a couple in December. Both spikes make me ponder what might have been the case (in terms of speed of supply-side response) had we already been operating with 5-minute Settlement. I see (but don’t note on the chart) what appears to be some reduction in demand in response to these prices – but this seems smaller than in some prior years (I know of some energy users who have reduced consumption in general terms, and so are not available to provide demand response like that, because of escalating prices ). Also noted in the NEMreview trend for today, Scheduled Demand peaked up at 8,708MW in the 17:00 dispatch interval . Scheduled Demand is what we chose to include in NEM-watch v10 because it is the demand that the AEMO “sees” in dispatching scheduled generators to keep the balance between supply and demand. This peak in Scheduled Demand occurred coincident with (and partially because) the estimated injection from small-scale solar PV across the state wound back to close to zero, by combination of late in the day and also cloud bands thankfully passing through. Also noted on the chart is an estimated peak in “Native Demand” (closer to what a layperson might think of as electricity demand – being the aggregate rate of electricity used by everyone, no matter where supplied from). Interestingly this is shown to occur a couple hours after the apparent temperatures peaked at the Brisbane airport and Archerfield. What would have been the final result had the temperatures not backed off somewhat through the afternoon? Well, we might experience that tomorrow… (B) Looking forward into Sunday 14th January 2018 Note highlighted in the NEM-Watch v10 image above the Market Notice issued by AEMO at 19:23 for forecasting extreme temperatures in the Queensland region. Here’s the full text of the notice: With the temperature high, and probably the humidity as well, the capability of different generators will be affected in different way (in terms of output capability). This is why AEMO is calling on generators to review the capacity they offer to the market tomorrow through their bids. Flipping the charts in NEM-Watch to “Trading” to show AEMO’s P30 predispatch forecasts, we see AEMO’s current expectation (as at 20:20 NEM time) is that the demand will peak up at 8,670MW in the 17:00 trading period – so effectively just as high as today, which is noteworthy given that this is for a Sunday, which normally has lower levels of demand: Let’s find somewhere cool for tomorrow…",

    "title": "A stinking hot weekend poses a reminder of the difficulty of forecasting electricity demand",
    "date": "07-01-2018 03:17:00 PM",
    "content": "A quick post on Sunday afternoon from a thankfully cooler Brisbane (with the cricket out at tea) to briefly recap what we’ve seen happening over the weekend. (A) Saturday was very hot in Victoria, South Australia and even Tassie On Friday I posted a note of caution for those seemingly too trigger happy to talk about a stretched supply and demand balance and the triggering of the emergency “Reserve Trader” demand response measures that AEMO has assembled for next-to-last-resort protection of the system if supplies become stretched. Yesterday I did take the time to have a quick look at demand in Victoria and post this image from our NEM-Watch Consumption Widget, which we are pleased to provide as a free access tool thanks to the sponsorship of Energy Consumers Australia : As I had expected, demand was nowhere near the all-time record – however others did note to me that the demand did turn out about 600MW higher than the AEMO had originally forecast. Hence I quickly called up the Forecast Convergence Widget within ez2view to have a look at successive forecasts for Scheduled Demand on the day: The higher-than-expected demand on Saturday can clearly be seen, with the actual Scheduled Demand topping out at around 8,000MW at 16:30 on the day (that’s NEM time, so add an hour to get 17:30 local time in Melbourne). That was about 500MW higher than the forecast for Scheduled Demand published by AEMO just prior to 09:48 (NEM time) on Friday ( 7,511MW shown in this image ). Now there could be a number of plausible reasons why such a forecast “error” might have come about (and frequent readers will remember that I have a great deal of sympathy for those whose role necessitates they engage in that “mug’s game” ). Out of curiosity I flipped the view to look at successive forecasts from the AEMO for aggregate (large-scale) wind and solar generation in the region – revealing what seems to be one of the contributing factors: Because this intermittent supply operates in front of (always) dispatchable generation it is not counted in the calculation of “Scheduled Demand”. Hence the fact that it unexpectedly disappeared (a couple hours earlier than forecast) will have contributed to the higher-than-forecast Scheduled Demand. As noted before, forecasting is a somewhat thankless task, and one that seems to be increasingly difficult to get right (given the increasing number of independent variables playing a role). However it is also increasingly important in the new energy world we’re transitioning into . (B) Sunday was very hot in New South Wales Today it’s hot in Sydney, making me (almost) feel sorry for the English cricketers on a pretty “character building” day at the SCG. A little earlier, I was able to tweet this image from the ECA Widget : Note the marked difference in the colour of demand for Victoria compared to Saturday – given the much lower temperatures (and natural reduction in Sunday demand). A third quick post from Forecast Convergence from ez2view today, this time focused on the NSW region shows another example of the challenges in getting demand forecasts close to actuals: Back to the cricket to see how many more wickets have fallen…",

    "title": "It’ll be hot in parts of the NEM tomorrow (Saturday 6th Jan) but don’t expect demand to be too high – and don’t be trigger happy on the Emergency Demand Response!",
    "date": "05-01-2018 10:13:00 AM",
    "content": "The weather forecast is for some pretty extreme temperatures tomorrow in parts of the NEM – such as in Melbourne as shown here in the weather forecast thanks to Weather.com and Google: Given the strong correlation between temperatures and electricity demand, and heightened general awareness of the complexities of balancing supply and demand across any electricity grid (in part because of the train wreck that’s been part of this mismanaged energy transition ), it’s no surprise to see some media reports on expectations for Saturday. Out of interest I dialled up this pre-prepared trend of NEM-wide demand and available generation that forms one of a growing number of web widgets in ez2view ( clients can access the live updating NEM-wide template here , and so modify for their own purposes) to see what the AEMO is forecasting will happen through Saturday, and through the coming week: It’s too early in the day today for AEMO’s predispatch forecast to look through the whole of Saturday (especially through to the evening peak in demand, which is the bit of particular interest). For the same reason, AEMO’s predispatch price forecasts for each region are not yet available. Hence the demand forecasts incorporates AEMO’s 50% POE demand forecast from ST PASA, which currently extends out till early Friday. The most obvious point to make, in relation to this chart, is that a NEM-wide demand forecast of only 28,000MW is pretty modest indeed – but is expected for two main reasons (with another factor thrown in for good measure): Major Reason #1) Tomorrow is a Saturday . Weekend days will typically have much lower demand than during weekdays because of lower commercial and industrial load (remembering that C&I load is the lion’s share of consumption in the NEM ). Major Reason #2) It’s very early in January . To compound the weekend effect is the well-established effect of the holiday hangover from the Christmas and New Year period. Minor Reason #3) Solar PV (which is predominantly small-scale currently) is pushing peak Scheduled Demand later in the day. As discussed before ( here and here ), the current crop of solar PV has had the effect of eating into Native Demand (combined with other factors) leaving a smaller residual for the AEMO to meet in dispatching the market Scheduled Demand. On Saturday the forecast (at least for Melbourne, shown above) is for low cloud cover, which will mean higher solar PV harvest and more of that “eating away” effect – hence both: 1) A lower Scheduled Demand; and 2) The peak in Scheduled Demand occurring later in the day (17:30 NEM time as shown in the chart). The second point to make is that there is plenty of surplus generation capacity on hand across the NEM – so no concerns for the supply and demand balance, unless something startling happened in a few places. Given that I’ve included the weather forecast for Melbourne at the top, I thought it might be useful to also include this similar trend in demand for Victoria ( clients can access the live updating VIC template here ) – in this case including more of the history and (because we can drop the prices for the other regions) also including hourly average apparent temperature in Melbourne: As noted on the chart, the Scheduled Demand peak currently forecast for tomorrow (7,511MW at 17:00 NEM time, so 18:00 in Melbourne) is about the same as that forecast for Thursday – despite the fact that it’s forecast to be only 33 degrees on Thursday (illustrating the “weekend effect”). I also note that Thursday is forecast for a few more clouds, so would expect that AEMO’s forecasts of solar PV output might be a little lower on Thursday than they would be for tomorrow (notwithstanding the significant challenges still to be overcome in longer-range intermittent generation forecasts ). Finally, I note this article from Samantha Hutchinson at the Australian – who seems to be a little too trigger happy to talk of the need for AEMO to activate its emergency reserves of a certain form of Demand Response. 1) As explained in the various pages linked off this Demand Response site here , there are a number of different forms of Demand Response (and I’ve already commented on how it’s sometimes erroneously reported to be non-existent in the NEM ). 2) It’s important to remember that the AEMO’s “Emergency Reserve” is exactly that – for Emergencies only. Were the AEMO to become as trigger happy as some journalists seem to be becoming to trigger these emergency (i.e. outside the market) responses to tight supply and demand, it would seem inevitable that faith in the “normal” dispatch process for price establishment would quickly drop, leading to a wide range of unintended consequences.

    "content": "Two times within two weeks! Guest author Allan O’Neil wrote about ”Out of the blue, an LOR2 ” in exploring some of what happened on Friday 20th December. Today we seem confronted by a similar situation, in which AEMO has published three Market Notices almost simultaneously, as noted below. But first some quick context (A) It all seemed relatively calm… I posted this article early this morning when, at the time, the forecast for the NEM later this afternoon looked relatively calm (despite the extreme temperatures forecast, and some pretty dire bushfire warnings). In his comment on that article, guest author Allan O’Neil also drew attention to the fact that Loy Yang B1 had come off for a tube leak on Sunday morning – as seen here in a snapshot from ez2view ‘Bids & Offers’ widget looking back at that time: Through the day, we also watched as aggregate production from Wind and Solar generation in Victoria declined – though notably there was not such a startling gap between ‘actual’ and ‘forecast’ as we saw on the 20th December: (B) … until something changed Early this afternoon I noticed that Angela MacDonald-Smith had posted an article “Extreme heat keeps power market on high alert” in the AFR , which included this line: … which is another one to tag with the ‘spoken too soon’ label given the price volatility that began in the 15:05 dispatch interval shown in this image I tweeted shortly afterwards. The 15:10 and 15:15 dispatch intervals also saw high prices in VIC (at 15:15 also in SA). Here’s 15:10 via NEMwatch : For the 15:20 dispatch interval (i.e. at 15:16) the AEMO had published 3 Market Notices of interest, as shown here in the ‘Market Notices’ Widget in ez2view: This does raise the same underlying question – what changed so quickly to trigger another LOR2 (Low Reserve Condition) Notice, essentially out of the Blue? Market Notice 72138 helps to explain one of the contributors: ————————- MARKET NOTICE 072138 ________________________________________________________________________________________________ Notice ID 72138 Notice Type ID Inter-Regional Transfer limit variation Notice Type Description MARKET Issue Date Monday, 30 December 2019 External Reference Inter regional transfer limit variation – 051 Lower Tumut to Wagga 330 kV line – NSW region ________________________________________________________________________________________________ AEMO ELECTRICITY MARKET NOTICE Inter regional transfer limit variation – 051 Lower Tumut to Wagga 330 kV line – NSW region At 1447 hrs there was an unplanned outage of the 051 Lower Tumut to Wagga 330 kV line in the NSW region The following Constraint sets were invoked at 1500 hrs until further notice.

An interesting follow-on question would be to understand why this did not happen … (food for some later analysis at some point). In this later snapshot from 15:30 we see approx 250MW of what appears to be spot-price triggered Demand Response (looking like the type which we have helped facilitate for numerous clients across the NEM – including a number in Victoria – for many years ) which would have helped to unload the tight supply/demand balance. … that’s all I have time for now… (C) PS – Reserve Trader Dispatched Worth noting, as a brief PS, that Reserve Trader was dispatched for the half-hour ending 16:30 (NEM time) and forecast to apply until half-hour ending 23:00 (NEM time): ———————————- MARKET NOTICE 072167 ________________________________________________________________________________________________ Notice ID 72167 Notice Type ID Reserve Contract / Direction / Instruction Notice Type Description MARKET Issue Date Monday, 30 December 2019 External Reference RERT DISPATCHED ________________________________________________________________________________________________ AEMO ELECTRICITY MARKET NOTICE.

    "date": "27-12-2019 11:58:00 AM",
    "content": "On Tuesday we saw the good news that Loy Yang A2 had returned to service , albeit a few days later than initially planned. To round out the Christmas week, this morning (Friday 27th December) we noticed that Origin Energy’s Mortlake 2 unit back to service and up close to full load – a few days earlier than their most recently announced 30th December return date (though I do have a vague memory there was initially talk of that also being around 20th December). Mortlake had been out of service since 8th July 2019 . (A) Mortlake starts back up Using this trend in NEMreview v7 , we see now that Mortlake 2 had actually shown a burst of output on the Monday evening 23rd December: Out of curiosity, I pulled up the ‘Bids & Offers’ Widget in installed ez2view to focus specifically on the trend in bids (and particularly rebids) for Mortlake 2 over recent days: Unsurprisingly (as returns-to-service are complex processes after what would have been a complex repair process) we see numerous rebids over the period since the first bid shown for last Friday 20th December (i.e. prior to first operations). For those interested in the automated categorisation of rebid reasons, with respect to AER Rebidding Guidelines , as part of our Generator Report Card 2018 (and which we are expanding as a comprehensive cataloguing of every rebid for every unit through CAL2019 in the Generator Statistical Digest 2019 ) we see see that all of these rebids are of consistent form and are categorised as ‘Well Formed (Loose)’ or ‘Not Well Formed (Strict)’ because of the lack of space between HHMM and Category. (B) Mortlake stats through CAL 2019 Coincidentally, whilst we watch Mortlake Unit 2 restart this morning we are also reviewing Tuesday’s draft of our (nearly completed!) Generator Statistical Digest 2019 . In the past couple weeks whilst we have been working through these drafts, I have found this particular summary trend a very useful quick-reference guide to the type of operations that each unit has experienced through Calendar 2019: I can see here that (prior to the 6-month outage period) some months saw capacity factors in the 40% range , which was higher than I had been assuming in my mental model for the plant (and reinforces the value of having access to ready-reference stats like these). Because I had it open, here’s the same stats for Mortlake Unit 1: We have a clear sense that we’ll be finding much value in referring back to stats pages like these through the whole of 2020, and are keenly awaiting the release of the Generator Statistical Digest 2019 in about 2 weeks… (C) Victorian outlook for coming weeks and months… Now that both Loy Yang A2 and Mortlake 2 have returned to service, I thought it might be useful to provide these two views of the future ahead (according to AEMO’s ‘base case’ forecasts in ST PASA and MT PASA) this summer/Q1: (C1) The week-ahead view into ST PASA Using this trend view in ez2view online , we can clearly see that Monday next week (30th December 2019) is forecast to be the stand-out in the week ahead: Currently (as at 10:20 today) the peak level for Operational Demand is forecast to be up just shy of the level experienced last Friday 20th December where we saw some remarkable conditions emerge (discussed here on Saturday , on Monday , and here on Tuesday (thanks Allan)). I also note that the forecast currently for Monday is for cloudy conditions, which might also dampen injections from solar PV (both grid-scale and rooftop) – another reminder of what we discussed in the Generator Report Card 2018 : Following from this remarkable Market Notice on Monday evening (thanks to those who have relayed the message to Wind and Solar Farm operators via various channels!) we also saw this morning Market Notice 72088 reminding us of extreme conditions forecast for Victoria (Monday 30th) and NSW (Tuesday 31st): ——————————————————————- MARKET NOTICE ——————————————————————- From : AEMO To : NEMITWEB1 Creation Date : 27/12/2019 10:06:05 ——————————————————————- Notice ID : 72088 Notice Type ID : GENERAL NOTICE Notice Type Description : Subjects not covered in specific notices Issue Date : 27/12/2019 External Reference : Market reporting for forecast extreme temperature in the New South Wales region on 31/12/2019 and Victoria region on 30/12/2019 and elevated temperatures in South Australia region ——————————————————————- Reason : AEMO ELECTRICITY MARKET NOTICE AEMO’s weather service provider has issued forecast temperatures for New South Wales (NSW) region and Victoria (VIC) region that are equal to or greater than the Generation Capacity Reference Temperatures: NSW On 31/12/2019: Maximum forecast temperature 43degrees C at Bankstown for the Sydney area.

BASSLINK- (Latrobe Valley Airport 43 degrees C AND GEORGE TOWN 33 degrees C) Harmohan Singh AEMO Operations ——————————————————————- END OF REPORT ——————————————————————- We’ll have to wait to see what unfolds…. (C2) The quarter-ahead view into MT PASA Using this different trend view in ez2view online , we can clearly what the AEMO (combined with ASX Energy prices for standard contracts for Q1 2020 in VIC) is saying for the quarter ahead: The short synopsis of all of this information for Q1 2020 is that “it will be tight!” , at times (i.e. when temperatures are extreme). However I have hoped, by showing some historical data in context to the MT PASA forecasts for Available Generation (scheduled only) and Demand (hot day peak demand forecast only) to help the reader understand the conservatism naturally (and understandably) built into the process, given its primary purpose. Given this, it’s not really a surprise to see both: (a) Many days forecast where LOLP (Loss of Load Probability) is above 0% ; and (b) Non-zero monthly Unserved Energy (in MWh) in January and February 2020 , especially under the 10% POE (Probability of Exceedance) demand case, which assumes that the demand will peak slightly above to the all-time record for Victoria (i.e. 10,496MW on a Scheduled Demand basis). Given demand last Friday was above 9,000MW leading into Christmas, and is forecast to be around 9,000MW again on Monday next week and we’re forecasted to have a long hot and dry summer, it’s clear that this is a plausible scenario – though not ‘most likely’. Hence, it is not really a surprise to see that the Base Load Futures Contract for VIC Q1 2020 was most recently trading just below $130/MWh (all hours for the quarter) and peak at exactly $200/MWh and caps at just under $50 – but again compare with where the daily average spot trended for Q4.",

    "title": "Out of the blue, an LOR2",
    "date": "24-12-2019 03:44:00 PM",
    "content": "Considering the extraordinary weather, bushfires, and a couple of large Victorian generators still not back from long term repairs, last week was probably less eventful for the NEM than might have been expected, but it certainly wasn’t incident-free. A very industrious Paul McArdle somehow found the time to cover in considerable depth a couple of the big days in South Australia (Thursday) and Victoria (Friday) , along with a detailed look at the forecast LOR2 conditions in Victoria on Wednesday – which ultimately didn’t eventuate. What, you may ask, is “LOR2” anyway? A quick reminder below of what AEMO’s Lack of Reserve categories mean (or click here for another take): LOR3 Most severe Lack of Reserve condition. Forecast LOR3 means that AEMO projects that in some future period, involuntary load shedding will be necessary to maintain system security in at least one NEM region. Actual LOR3 means that involuntary load shedding is currently occurring. LOR2 System is currently ( Actual LOR2 ), or is projected in a future period to be ( Forecast LOR2 ), just one contingency away from LOR3 – load shedding. A “contingency” is generally loss of a major generator or transmission element. LOR1 System is currently ( Actual LOR1 ), or is projected in a future period to be ( Forecast LOR1 ), one contingency away from LOR2, and thus two contingencies away from load shedding. The key thing about LOR2 (and of course LOR3) conditions is that AEMO seeks to avoid their actual occurrence wherever possible; in the first instance by alerting participants and seeking “market responses” – such as generators offering in more capacity where available. If insufficient response is forthcoming as the time of projected LOR2 approaches, AEMO may intervene in the market and take actions such as directing participants to provide extra capacity if feasible, or preparing for voluntary load shedding under RERT arrangements, in order to keep the real time supply-demand balance outside LOR2 territory. AEMO will strive not to run the system in an actual LOR2 condition for any length of time if there is a feasible alternative. So forecasts of LOR conditions are very important steps along the path of AEMO alerting participants to possible system security risks, encouraging market responses, and preparing for intervention if ultimately necessary. Which is why it was surprising to say the least to see AEMO declare actual LOR2 conditions for Victoria at 17:19 NEM time (6:19 PM local time) last Friday , when no earlier announcements of forecast LOR2 had been made , and only a small dip into LOR1 territory had been forecast for the hour between 17:00 and 18:00 (NEM time, which I’ll use from hereon in) . Paul’s excellent timeline sets out the full sequence of notices in detail. The underlying factors that drove the supply demand balance into LOR2 territory are pretty clear, and were well covered in Paul’s analysis extreme temperatures and high demand in both Victoria and South Australia, notwithstanding that demand was lower than it might have been had the same conditions occurred a week or two earlier, before some schools and businesses had wound down for Christmas the two large Victorian generators still on outage falling output from Victorian windfarms across Friday afternoon The last point was a surprise, not because windfarms are designed or typically expected to provide any particular level of output at times of high demand – unlike dispatchable generation – but because it was a reasonably windy afternoon and forecast levels of windfarm production had looked solid that morning, leaving the market looking well supplied despite the heat and outages. We can see the extent of the drop after about midday in the following chart of aggregate Victorian windfarm output for Friday. More detailed data and analysis at individual windfarm level will be needed to confirm the extent, but the major culprit behind the falling output was almost certainly not wind strength unexpectedly dropping away, but instead some major wind generators derating due to the extreme temperature conditions, and significantly reducing their maximum output capability regardless of wind strength. Hence AEMO’s reiterated pleas for generators to update their actual capability under extreme heat conditions, noted in Paul’s followup post . Paul’s prior post included this much busier chart which highlighted a massive-looking gap between forecasts of wind (and solar) output and what actually unfolded through the afternoon. Solar farms generally produced as expected, so the gap here was basically all down to wind forecasts vs actuals: Now, the key thing you have to know if you plan to spend some of your Boxing Day reading any more of this post is that AEMO doesn’t produce just one set of forecasts for windfarm (and solar farm) output, but at least four (and the table below excludes some variants of these): Granularity & Horizon Used In Description Half hourly, ~6-7 days STPASA STPASA (Short Term Projected Assessment of Supply Adequacy) process assesses physical supply-demand balance (LOR conditions) from 1-2 days ahead out to 6-7 days. Half hourly aggregate projections for wind+solar based on farm availability and weather forecasts. Updated every 3 hours. Half hourly, <1-2 days PDPASA PD30 PDPASA process mirrors STPASA for current day and (after 12:30) following day. Half hourly aggregate projections for wind+solar based on farm availability and weather forecast.Updated every half hour. PD30 process (30 minute predispatch ) projects market dispatch volumes and prices, based on same underlying half-hourly wind+solar forecast (+bids). Updated every half hour. 5 minutely, 1 hour (wind / solar aggregated) PD5 PD5 process (5 minute predispatch) mirrors PD30 but at 5 minute granularity for the next hour only. Updated every 5 minutes. 5 minutely, (individual farms) Dispatch Real time market dispatch for each individual semi-scheduled wind or solar farm uses a 5 minute ahead forecast of farm availability (expected maximum output). This has historically been supplied by AEMO’s forecasting systems, although recent capability has been added for participants to supply their own forecast. This availability forecast is generally the output level the farm is expected to provide by the end of the 5 minute dispatch interval. Under constraint conditions, or if the farm has offered some of its energy at higher prices than the spot price, it may be given a semi-dispatch target lower than its availability. The whole point of this post (and yes it’s taken a while to get here) is that under Friday’s unusual conditions, and for a variety of reasons which aren’t entirely clear, these sets of forecasts diverged very markedly and that divergence was almost certainly the key factor in the sudden declaration of Actual LOR2 with little or no prior warning. Thing is, if AEMO’s market dispatch engine (NEMDE) had been relying on the same forecasts shown in Paul’s chart, and assumed that windfarms would produce to those levels every five minutes, the market would have gone into major convulsions much earlier in the day. NEMDE balances supply and demand at 5 minute intervals, and a gap in NEMDE’s calculations due to wind output being 5-600 MW lower than assumed would have had dire consequences for real time dispatch, which we obviously didn’t see. By digging into the 5 minute dispatch data, we can extract the actual availability levels – 5 minute ahead farm-level forecasts, per the last line of the table above – which NEMDE was using for Victorian wind and solar farms. I’ve charted these below in aggregate, along with actual physical output levels achieved: This shows that NEMDE was in fact using farm availabilities which in aggregate were much closer to the actual output levels achieved – but note some upward spikes in availability between about 14:30 and 16:00 NEM time. By excavating further down to individual farm level, we see where those spikes were coming from: (Note this chart also shows output from older non-scheduled farms, for which an explicit availability target isn’t set. However forecasts for these farms are still used in all the processes listed above and appear to have followed similar patterns to the newer semi-scheduled farms.) It’s clear on this chart that forecast 5 minute dispatch availabilities for many farms basically tracked their actual – falling – output during the afternoon, but there are a number of exceptions like Murra Warra, Mt Mercer, Kiata, Salt Creek and briefly Mt Gellibrand where forecast availability spikes up in the 14:30-16:00 window. We can also see Oaklands Hill being constrained down consistently below its forecast availability throughout the day – the result of an individual network constraint. It appears from this chart that most real time windfarm availabilities being used in 5 minute dispatch were being driven not by forecasts derived from wind speed and turbine power curves (known as “energy conversion model” or ECM-based forecasts), but by so-called “persistence” forecasting based off actual observed outputs. The jumps in dispatch availability for some farms may represent the forecasts switching between this mode and ECM and then back for some reason – but I’d be speculating on this. The obvious question though is why the longer time horizon 30 minute forecasts being used in AEMO’s PDPASA and PD30 processes – which are the ones shown in Paul’s chart – became disconnected almost completely from what was happening in the real world across the afternoon. I’ve prepared this somewhat busy chart that tries to bring together this whole forecasting disconnect in one picture: What’s clear here is that from about midday onwards, the progressively falling actual output and real-time 5 minute availability level for windfarm output had very limited impact on the forecasts at 30 minute granularity, until the last P30 forecast for the 19:00 trading interval (made at 18:30), where the sudden tick down in the forecast brings it much closer to actual output levels. And the big problem with this from the perspective of forecasting and reporting on Lack of Reserve levels, is that the key process used to do this for the on-the-day timeframe is the half hourly PDPASA run, which relies on that P30 forecast. I’m not familiar enough with the mechanics of and inputs to the P30/PDPASA forecasting process to comment on how and why the disconnect occurred and persisted as long as it did, but its consequences could have been unfortunate. Fortunately the Actual LOR2 condition wasn’t followed by Actual LOR3, because nothing tripped in the interim. AEMO announced intentions to seek short term RERT contracts in order to reduce demand, but perhaps not surprisingly were not able to conclude any given the lack of notice period and on the last Friday afternoon before a holiday week. And on that note, thanks for reading this far and a happy festive season to all WattClarity readers. ——————————————- About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

It says: ———————— MARKET NOTICE 072015 ________________________________________________________________________________________________ Notice ID 72015 Notice Type ID Subjects not covered in specific notices Notice Type Description MARKET Issue Date Monday, 23 December 2019 External Reference Semi-scheduled and intermittent non-scheduled generation availability under extreme high temperature ________________________________________________________________________________________________ AEMO ELECTRICITY MARKET NOTICE Refer AEMO Electricity Market Notice 72013. AEMO’s weather service provider is forecasting extreme high ambient temperatures across NEM regions. AEMO reminds semi-scheduled and intermittent non-scheduled generators to advise AEMO of any reduction in available capacity caused by temperature derating . For any reduction in availability please ensure to: 1. Update SCADA Local Limit or, if unavailable, advise AEMO control room to implement a quick constraint to the reduced available capacity level; and 2.

Refer to the AER Rebidding and Technical Parameters Guideline: https://www.aer.gov.au/system/files/AER%20Final%20Guidline%20-%20Rebidding%20and%20Technical%20Parameters%20Guideline%20-%2028%20February%202017.pdf AEMO Operations ———————— It seems to me that four things have been happening: Observation #1) What happened on Friday last week in Victoria (where LOR2 was announced out-of-the-blue and RERT Negotiations commenced – as explored here on Saturday , with more exploration to come) reinforced to us that high temperature limitations on plant are very real . In our Generator Report Card 2018 (Theme 6 in Part 2 of the 180-page Analytical component) we explored a number of ways in which the NEM is becoming increasingly dependent on the weather : I have already posted articles about how the majority of the infrastructure supporting the NEM – including Wind Farms , like those affected on Friday last week – seem to have limitations on output during extreme tempe ratures. With the way the climate is changing, this will make balancing supply and demand more challenging in these extreme conditions. Observation #2) Despite the fact that it is known that all plant experience high temperature limitations, the degree to which these occurred last week both surprised , and alarmed . That’s not a good development, with another 2-3 hot and dry months ahead of us. It’s especially not a good development, seeing as (I infer) AEMO’s pleas for additional information seem to be falling on (at least) some deaf ears. Observation #3) An unknown number of operators of Semi-Scheduled and Intermittent Non-Scheduled plant (i.e. solar farms and wind farms operating in the NEM) have not responded to the AEMO , or at least have not responded to the AEMO’s satisfaction. Observation – or perhaps Question #4) We wonder how such a situation has come about , where it seems (unless I am mistaken) that there are a non-trivial number of generation participants who are seemingly non-responsive to the need to participate in the market in this way? Are they unaware, or incapable of responding, do they not know what the details of how their plant performs, or is there some other explanation? In our Generator Report Card 2018 (Theme 5 in Part 2 of the 180-page Analytical component) we pondered whether the form of support for new entry by these types of plant that the AEMO is speaking directly to in this Market Notice was opening up a “them and us” schism , which would lead to situations such as (it appears) we are seeing unfold this week? Challenging times ahead for the NEM… I hope not this train-wreck . ————————— Whatever any reader can do to pass on this message to those they know who operate these plant would (I am surmising) be greatly appreciated by the AEMO – and also perhaps reduce the risk that the AER will step in to take enforcement action ? ————————— PS2 – Wed 24th AM. Given that I mentioned possible AER enforcement action , it’s worth also linking in this AER Release “Energy businesses must be ready for summer says AER” with the linked “NEM Summer Readiness compliance bulletin and checklist” from Fri 20th December, and highlight the following quote: Issuing the Summer Readiness Compliance Bulletin 2019 , AER Chair Clare Savage said that robust enforcement ensuring compliance with the law is vital in building consumer trust that companies are doing the right thing. “This week is hot and we’re only just into what promises to be a long summer of severe weather. People understand things can go wrong under extreme conditions, but they won’t forgive outages caused by a lack of preparation or avoidable mistakes. ”The AER will take a dim view of any compliance breaches by energy businesses . It goes without saying they should maintain a strong focus on compliance at all times,” Ms. Savage said. We can’t say we have not been warned! ————————— PS1 – Tue 23rd PM (a few hours later) Thanks to those who have been able to pass this message onto the relevant people in VRE Generators.

    "title": "What happened yesterday (Fri 20th Dec 2019) in the Victorian Region? A first look…",
    "date": "21-12-2019 08:43:00 PM",
    "content": "As a company (i.e. Global-Roam Pty Ltd ), we’re coming up on the end of our 20th year of operations , and what a journey it’s been! We’ve appreciated the opportunity to serve a large and diverse range of clients (both those who’ve been with us for 10 or 15 years – and also those who just came onboard, or came back, in 2019). Over this journey we have been using our software to watch the market for a variety of different reasons. It was around 2007, I think, when we began to formalise some of this “NEM watching” with the inception of this WattClarity ® industry commentary site, which has continue to grow from strength to strength since that time. We watch the NEM a lot! Over the years of watching the NEM, I can’t recall too many weeks like the extreme week that’s just coming to a close – which is ordinarily a pretty non-eventful time in the leadup to Christmas with schools closed and many already on holidays (including our a-little-less-respected PM, coincidentally). All going well our highly valued guest author, Allan O’Neil , will be taking a deeper look at some of what’s unfolded through the week with an article or two that should go live sometime over the next week or so. However curiosity’s got the better of me this afternoon, so I thought I would have a quick look at what happened yesterday afternoon in the Victorian region of the NEM. (A) Broad overview Using this trend on NEMreview v7 I have produced this view of the high level stats for what unfolded through the day: Temperatures* pushed well past 40°C across much of the state driving Operational Demand past 9,000MW (which would not ordinarily be worth much comment, given that peak all-time record is 1,500MW or so beyond that level). * as per the annotation, some more learned Weather Watcher can explain the reason for such a large deviation between temperature and apparent temperature? For approx 4 hours through the afternoon we saw Victorian demand push beyond the aggregate level of available generation capacity in the state, highlighting the need for imports from interconnected South Australia, Tasmania and New South Wales. Whilst this is not an uncommon event during times of high demand, coincident hot weather in South Australia (the 4th day in a row) drove demand there and interconnection capacity from Basslink and New South Wales was maxed out at times through this period. As a result the dispatch price in Victoria produced major spikes at 17:20 ($14,499.99/MWh) and at 17:35 ($11,500.80/MWh) which drove the trading price for the hour-long period from 17:00 to 18:00 well past $1,000/MWh. However if this was all that happened, it would not be all that noteworthy as one of the more volatile days of summer (of which there are typically always some). (B) Particular points of interest I’m presuming that Allan will probably highlight other particular points from Friday that peaked his curiosity, as part of his broader review of the week-that-was. Just wanted to flag two big ones from my perspective: (B1) Loy Yang A2 did not return in time Firstly it is worth noting that, contrary to earlier advice from AGL Energy, Loy Yang A2 did not return in time to make a contribution to the Victorian region through Friday (or indeed even Saturday as I write this). Whilst these sorts of slight delays are completely understandable given the complexity of the 6-month repair process that has been undertaken, it’s particularly noticeable given that we’ve all been sweating on the return of the Loy Yang A2 unit (and also Mortlake 2 – which has an expected return date of 30th December I believe). (B2) Surprise notice of LOR2 commencement, and RERT Negotiations My sense is that what unfolded through the day did not go to plan – firstly for AEMO and hence also for Market Participants and broader stakeholders (it certainly provided ample distractions through the afternoon for us in our role). The following table sums up a rough sequence of events highlighting the unexpectedness of certain events – leading to other outcomes that surprised the broader market: Trading Period (i.e. half-hour ending) NEM Time VIC Trading Price What happened (click on images for a full-screen view) 12:30 $148.20/MWh Beginning around 12:30 there appears to be a significant deviation open up between AEMO’s forecasts for the (aggregate) Available Generation capacity across all Semi-Scheduled Wind Farms in VIC and what the actual availability was. See charts below. 13:00 $291.60/MWh . 13:30 $267.27/MWh . 14:00 $184.92/MWh It was around 13:55 that I finally finished my not-so-quick review of the volatility seen the previous day (Thursday) in South Australia . Whilst I was finishing off that article, a different drama was evolving in the Victorian region on Friday. 14:30 $343.10/MWh . 15:00 $324.91/MWh . 15:30 $162.56/MWh At 15:21 the AEMO publishes Market Notice 71921 which announces forecast LOR1 condition in Victoria from 17:30 to 18:00 on this day. For those not so familiar with NEM Jargon here’s a brief description of the LOR (Low Reserve Condition) warning system. 16:00 $268.53/MWh . 16:30 $185.48/MWh At 16:15 the AEMO publishes Market Notice 71932 which extends the forecast LOR1 condition in Victoria from 17:00 to 18:00 on this day. At 16:17 the AEMO publishes Market Notice 71933 about limitations with respect to the transfer capability on the two interconnectors between VIC to SA: ———————– There is a short notice outage of the Heywood M1 500/275 kV Transformer (Vic region). The outage is scheduled from 1355 hrs until further notice The following Constraint Sets are invoked for this outage. S-X_BC_CP V-HYTX_M12 The constraint sets contain equations the following interconnectors on the LHS V-S-MNSP1 V-SA ———————– … though note that the extremes in temperature seen in South Australia were also meaning extremes in demand there, and (with downward trend in wind/solar output) hence limited spare capacity to export SA to VIC in any case. 17:00 $200.03/MWh Around 16:40 (after puzzling about a large discrepancy between forecast and actuals for UIGF + TotalIntermittentGen in the Victorian region and discussions with several people) I thought it would be useful more broadly to post a message on social media ( here on Twitter , and here on LinkedIn ) to publicise this fact more broadly. Here’s the image that I posted at the time: As noted in the image (click on image for a fuller view), I wondered whether this was a copy-book case of where the extreme temperatures besetting Victoria were having the impact of limiting maximum output capability , as explained previously here on WattClarity® with the example of the Ararat Wind Farm (a.k.a. the “mystery DUID”) – and explored more fully for all DUIDs (of all Fuel Types) in our Generator Report Card 2018 . 17:30 $2,518.98/MWh I tweeted here about the following NEMwatch v10 snapshot for 17:05 (click on image for a fuller view) showing IRPM down at only 12% (i.e. 1,383MW) in the SA+VIC Economic Island created because of constrained flows in from TAS and NSW: Whilst ordinarily a surplus of 1,383MW I was quite nervous about how much of this could actually be counted on if an unknown amount of supply from wind and solar that AEMO was counting on in the predispatch time points ahead was not actually turning up when those time points arrived. There’s also an interesting (and sizeable) drop in demand in South Australia shown in the image for a couple hours earlier in the day, but that’s food for another exploration at some point. I presumed that AEMO was also nervous about this – because at 17:03 the AEMO publishes Market Notice 71934 announcing the intention to commence RERT Negotiations (i.e. Reserve Trader ) for the period of time 16:30 to 17:30 . The Market Notice says “AEMO will issue a further advice if reserve is contracted” and no further Market Notice was issued, so we presume no contracts were agreed? I tweeted about this Market Notice shortly before heading out the door on the walk home. Around 17:15:20 the AEMO will have published the dispatch price ( $14,499.99/MWh ) for the 17:20 dispatch interval – the prime reason the trading price ends up over $2000/MWh. Here’s a view of this particular dispatch interval using a 4-widget window in ez2view (click on image for a fuller view) time-travelled back to this first spike at 17:20: As shown clearly in this view, Victoria is quite close to running out of spare capacity at this point (and presumably South Australia as well). At 17:19 the AEMO issues Market Notice 71935 which states that Victoria had stepped up into an Actual LOR2 Lack of Reserve Level from 17:15 : ———————– Actual Lack Of Reserve Level 2 (LOR2) in the Vic region – 20/12/2019 An Actual LOR2 condition has been declared for the Vic region from 1715 hrs. The Actual LOR2 condition is not forecast in Pre Dispatch. The capacity reserve required is 570 MW The minimum reserve available is 448 MW AEMO is seeking an immediate market response. An insufficient market response may require AEMO to implement a AEMO intervention event. ———————– At 17:26 the AEMO publishes Market Notice 719346 announcing the intention to commence RERT Negotiations (i.e. Reserve Trader ) for the period of time 17:30 to 20:00 . Likewise this Market Notice also says “AEMO will issue a further advice if reserve is contracted” and no further Market Notice was issued, so we presume no contracts were agreed? Sometime(?) soon after this point (not sure if Twitter can tell us?) Dylan McConnell takes to twitter to ask me “How on earth does that happen?” in relation to the sudden/unexpected announcement of LOR2 – to which I posted this response which linked in my concern about what seemed to be such a large discrepancy. 18:00 $1,964.52/MWh Around 17:30:20 the AEMO will have published the dispatch price ( $11,500.80/MWh ) for the 17:35 dispatch interval – the prime reason the trading price ends up close to $2000/MWh. With the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view (click on image for a fuller view) we can see that this spike (and the prior spike at 17:15) arrived without being forecast in the immediately preceding Clearly something changed shortly after the AEMO published the P5 predispatch run at 17:05:35 to trigger the price spikes (as they had not been forecast before that point). 18:30 $93.07/MWh . 19:00 $100.30/MWh . 19:30 $97.52/MWh At 19:03 the AEMO issues Market Notice 71952 speaking about the forecast extreme in temperature to be experienced in NSW the following day (Saturday 21st December) and asks that: ———————– On 21/12/2019: Maximum forecast temperature 43?C at Bankstown for the Sydney area AEMO requests Scheduled and Semi-Scheduled Market Participants to: 1. review the weather forecast in the local area where their generating plants are located and, 2. if required, update the generation levels in their dispatch offers consistent with the forecast temperatures . Details on Generation Capacity Reference Temperatures can be accessed using the following link to AEMO website: http://www.aemo.com.au/Electricity/Planning/Related-Information/Generation-Information ———————– At 19:09 the AEMO issues Market Notice 71951 which states that the Actual LOR2 Level had been cancelled at 19:10 . Around 19:20 I posted a second message via social media ( here on Twitter , and here on LinkedIn ) referencing AEMO’s earlier Market Notice 71854 (from Monday 16th December) which asked all registered participants to update the high-temperature limitations of their generation assets: ———————– AEMO’s weather service provider has issued forecast temperatures for Queensland (QLD), New South Wales (NSW), Victoria (VIC) and South Australia (SA) regions that are equal to or greater than the Generation Capacity Reference Temperatures: QLD: On 16/12/2019: Maximum forecast temperature 41 degrees C at Archerfield for the Brisbane area. NSW: On 19/12/2019: Maximum forecast temperature 42 degrees C at Bankstown for the Sydney area. VIC: On 20/12/2019: Maximum forecast temperature 43 degrees C at Melbourne for the Melbourne area. (i.e. speaking of Friday, where temperatures did indeed turn out extreme) SA: On 18/12/2019: Maximum forecast temperature 43 degrees C at Adelaide for the Adelaide area. On 19/12/2019: Maximum forecast temperature 43 degrees C at Adelaide for the Adelaide area. On 20/12/2019: Maximum forecast temperature 45 degrees C at Adelaide for the Adelaide area. Also, note that elevated temperatures are forecast in some locations within the QLD, NSW, VIC and SA regions from 16/12/2019 to 22/12/2019. Further updates to this advice may not be provided. AEMO requests Market Participants to: 1. review the weather forecast in the local area where their generating plants are located and, 2. if required, update the generation levels in their dispatch offers consistent with the forecast temperatures . Details on Generation Capacity Reference Temperatures can be accessed using the following link to AEMO website: http://www.aemo.com.au/Electricity/Planning/Related-Information/Generation-Information ———————– Given the large discrepancy seen between forecast aggregate wind capability and what actually trended through the day, I wondered whether one of the factors contributing to the shortfall was that some Market Participants had not seen, did not know the answers to, or had ignored the AEMO’s instructions to advise them of their high temperature limitations? 20:00 $127.64/MWh . 20:30 $128.51/MWh . 21:00 $127.92/MWh With concerns about what might unfold the next day in NSW (and broader concerns about a hot and dry summer staring down at us in the coming weeks) around 21:00 I posted a third message via social media ( here on Twitter , and here on LinkedIn ) referencing this most recent Market Notice 71952 which (as shown above) again asked registered participants to let AEMO know of any high-temperature limitations on any generation units in their portfolio. 21:30 $94.38/MWh . 22:00 $75.75/MWh . That was some day! (C) What took the wind away? So today, with the benefit of a night’s sleep and access to the “next day” larger data set published by the AEMO for Friday 20th December, I can have a quick look at what unfolded through the afternoon. Using the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in ez2view , here are two views that I was unable to produce on Friday because the data was private at the time: (C1) Available Generation for all Semi-Scheduled Wind Farms Here’s a view of Forecast Convergence for aggregate unit availability (i.e. from AWEFS, using SCADA data inputs and known temperature limitations etc…) which shows a large discrepancy opens up at 12:30 on the day and does not close fully until around 22:00 (not shown on this chart). I’ve noted on the image that the discrepancy that opens up is consistently around 500-600MW over a period of many hours through the afternoon … and I wonder why? Perhaps there are a number of contributing factors. Now it was highlighted in the snapshot from 17:20 above that many plant in Victoria were subject to transmission congestion at the time. Because this chart looks at Available Generation it should be immune to any (later) “constraining down” AEMO needed to do on the wind farm output (I have not checked to see the size of any additional constraining down). As noted on the image, because this looks at Semi-Scheduled plant it does not see (as it’s not visible for AEMO) the Non-Scheduled Wind Farms. However it seems likely that the same issues would be affecting AEMO’s forecast of available contribution from the Non-Scheduled wind farms – hence the discrepancy would be larger than the 500-600MW noted on this image. (C2) Dispatch Target for all Semi-Scheduled Wind Farms Flipping the same filtered view to look at aggregate dispatch target, we see a remarkably similar view: This is entirely understandable, as wind farms bid to be dispatched (hence we would expect on most occasions that Target = Available Generation)! (C3) Available Generation for all (Scheduled and Semi-Scheduled) plant across Victoria Out of interest, I flipped the Available Generation view to a different filter, looking at all plant in Victoria: The size of the discrepancy (and hence the implied challenge of balancing supply and demand on this very hot and troubled day) is still shown quite starkly ! (C4) Not quite the same challenge with wind farms in South Australia! A quick final note – there was a large discrepancy open up with wind farms in South Australia for 13:00 and 13:30 in particular – but patterns then followed much more closely to forecasts for Available Generation. Why was that?",

    "title": "Not-So-Quick review of price spike in South Australian region yesterday (Thu 19th Dec) evening",
    "date": "20-12-2019 01:55:00 PM",
    "content": "Despite Tuesday’s forecasts of an LOR2 Low Reserve Condition for the Victorian region for late Wednesday afternoon , outcomes in the NEM turned out to be significantly milder (though I’m not talking about the temperature). Piecing together all the different factors contributing to the extent to which Victoria ‘dodged a bullet’ is food for another article sometime. However yesterday evening when I was out to dinner, my phone continued to buzz for over an hour, alerting me to the fact that outcomes were not quite so mild in the South Australian region of the NEM yesterday. I must admit to being a little distracted through that dinner given the steady stream of market alerts, then followed by questions from various people. Hence this morning I thought it might be worthwhile to distract myself a little more this morning by preparing a quick review of some of the factors I can see that occurred…. but little did I know it might take many hours more than planned, with ‘the onion’ progressively revealing more interesting stuff… (A) What happened? Everyone has had their own experience of ‘spoken too soon’, but I could not help but laugh when seeing this note from Chris Russell (journalist at the Adelaide Advertiser) yesterday evening as our market price alerts started to arrive: Note that the SA Power Networks message related to the forecasts (as at Thursday evening) for what would unfold in the South Australian region today (Fri 20th). This morning as I write this (well, it was morning when I started!) it still appears to be the case that there will be plenty of spare capacity ( ez2view users can see an updated trend here ). Yesterday evening, though, the Market Price Alerts kept coming for some time – the sense of which might be summed up in the following trend chart produced from NEMreview v7 (those with a licence can access this query here as a starting point to dig further): The 18:15 dispatch interval ( NEM time ) was the first one that saw the SA dispatch price spike above $1000/MWh (to $1,287.86/MWh) and the 19:35 dispatch interval ($14,700/MWh – the current Market Price Cap ). This meant 13 dispatch intervals at the Market Price Cap, at the end of a total of 17 dispatch intervals above $1,000/MWh . That’s the longest run of high prices I can recall since last summer. (B) Why did it happen? Here’s the snapshot from a display copy of NEMwatch v10 we have permanently running in our office that captured the second price spike (to $3,057.07/MWh – more than double the level of the first spike): I’ve annotated the image with a few key points, and will expand on these points (and others) below as factors at work through yesterday evening: Apologies, in advance, for those readers more knowledgeable than me (and who have more time to consider!) – as I am bound to have left a few factors out, and not fully explored those I have listed below. I hope this is (at least) a start… Factor 1) It was hot, real hot In plenty of other places much has been written about ‘hottest ever day’ and so on. Without getting bogged down into rabbit holes of measurement method and records and more, the main point is that it was really hot . According to the ten-minute BOM readings we provide access to through NEMreview v7 and ez2view , and free access in real time in the Energy Consumers Australia sponsored NEMwatch ‘Live Consumption Widget’ ) the temperature in Adelaide did not drop below 40°C until 19:30 (NEM time), and continued to be above 30°C right through the night ( low point, on quick scan, was 32.1 degC at 00:10 this morning after which point it started to climb again). Cripes! Factor 1a) Temperature drove underlying electricity consumption higher In the NEMwatch snapshot above, we see that the Scheduled Demand (i.e. TotalDemand target – remembering the nuances of how demand is measured) was 3,078MW in the 18:20 dispatch interval. The reddish colour helps to reinforce that it was up near the all-time maximum for the region (i.e. 3,402MW from Jan 2011) when measured on the same basis. The demand did reach 3,120MW at 18:45 – so 282MW below the all-time max. However the following longer-term trend of Demand from NEMreview can help users understand how extreme the demand was yesterday (i.e. on a day where many businesses would be at lower loads drifting into Christmas): As noted in this trend, the peak demand experienced yesterday (only one working day from the 2-week hiatus for Christmas and New Year) was the highest seen in almost five years since 16th January 2014 – a month which was, in turn, the only other instance since the all-time record was set on 31st January 2011. Hence it probably qualifies to say that the normal ‘peaky’ demand shape that South Australia sees hit extreme levels yesterday evening, especially considering we’re coasting into the Christmas and New Year shut-down of many businesses . I, for one, am not looking forward to the demand levels experienced in February and March 2020. Taking a closer look just within the evening period – using the ‘Forecast Convergence’ Widget within the installed ez2view software we see how quite small increases in demand were able to (in conjunction with other factors, discussed below) ‘pop’ the price out of a more normal pricing range and into the >$1,000/MWh stratosphere: In this case we have chosen to scale the colour-range dynamically across just the data points in the grid – with blue being the lowest number and red being the highest in the widget. This makes it very clear that quite small increases in demand were enough to tip the scales in pricing in the South Australian region. A very finely balanced supply curve! Factor 1b) Temperature also impacted in other ways In this year’s release of the Generator Report Card 2018 , we wrote (in Theme 6 within Part 2 of the 180-page analytical component) how the NEM is becoming increasingly dependent on the weather: Not only is the pattern of weather changing as our climate changes, we’re also seeing these changing weather patterns impact on the supply side of the energy equation in a number of ways as well – and yesterday evening was not an exception to this new dynamic. This is discussed further below. Factor 2) Imports from Victoria were Maxed Out Using this trend in NEMreview v7 we can see that the South Australian region was drawing on maximum supplies from Victoria (and further afield) from around 15:05 on Thursday – including the period of the price spike: Also noted was the decline in SA’s Import Capability (i.e. in AEMO-MMS-lingo this is ‘Exports’ (from VIC) on these interconnectors) seen through the morning. The reasons for this are multiple over that period, but the constraint equation “V^^S_NIL_MAXG_1” was one of the main ones which is a constraint equation always in place (i.e. ‘System Normal’ constraint set) focused on limiting imports to acceptable levels to protect South Australia (voltage stability) in the case of the largest single contingency generation less in the South Australian region. Here’s a view in the ‘Swim Lanes’ Widget within ez2view : Apologies that the image is a bit busy to the uninitiated. In the wash-up what this meant was that South Australia was on its own to supply any additional MW in demand in the South Australian region – hence it could only rely on generation local to the South Australian region. Factor 3) Enough spare generation capacity, but it was expensive First and foremost it is important to note that (because subtracting off the imports from Victoria) the South Australian generation fleet that was available during the period was more than enough to supply the demand. This was the underlying reason why there was no LOR Low Reserve Condition notices issued, or talk of load shedding. Problem is that what was there was all expensively priced! So let’s take a quick run through the fuel types to see what the situation was: 3a) Rooftop PV was winding up for the day Let’s firstly note that (reminding ourselves of some challenges with the ongoing opacity of rooftop PV that we really need to resolve ) the contribution from rooftop PV during the period of the spikes was fast declining ( your copy of this Rooftop PV query here ): At the start of the +$1000 price spike period, it was either 200MW or 100MW (depending on which estimate you reference). Certainly it seems like we can be confident that it was in that ball-park. At the end of the price spike period this contribution had faded away to nothing (or almost nothing, depending on which estimate you reference). 3b) Large-Scale PV also headed the same way There are only 3 Large-Scale solar units currently registered and operating in South Australia – so lower aggregate capacity than rooftop. Their pattern of output is quite similar to the rooftop PV above ( your copy of this Large Solar query here ): I can’t recall if Tailem Bend SF and Bungala 1/2 SF have tracking in place (most do – perhaps someone can confirm), but the curve does seem to suggest that the plant ekes out more from the declining solar resource later in the day. Adding to the rooftop solar PV, it seems we’re looking at a decline in solar production of between 200MW and 300MW from the start of the >$1000/MWh price dispatch intervals to the end. That’s going to have to have come from somewhere… 3c) Wind – two stories in one Now, there are a diverse range of readers who read WattClarity – including a number at either extreme of the Emotion-o-meter . When I looked at the following trend for wind in South Australia yesterday, I had to laugh in so clearly seeing two separate stories in the one chart (each story resonating to those at either extreme of this Emotion-o-meter): You can access your copy of this Wind query here : Story 1 = Increase in Wind neatly replaced the decline in solar (the ‘glass half full’) On WattClarity before we have explained why it’s anti-correlation we should be hoping for , and why randomness is not enough . The 17 dispatch intervals through which South Australia experienced >$1000/MWh prices coincided with an almost text-book li ke case of anti-correlation between the decline in solar production as the sun set and the increase in wind production from its low point in the period. That probably will have been one significant factor contributing (for instance) to the reason why AEMO did not advance the South Australian region into the LOR Low Reserve Condition territory with the evening decline of solar. Readers who want to stretch a little further would like to know that in Theme 10 within Part 2 of the 180-page analytical component of the massive Generator Report Card 2018 we completed a multi-year statistical analysis of actual generation data (and also 11-year history of historical wind speed across all Renewable Energy Zones) to delve into the question about how often it occurs that “the sun does not shine and wind does not blow”: It’s not all the time that we see anti-correlation like this (as discussed in the Generator Report Card ) which is why these three charts made me sit back and say ‘Wow!’ . Curious to dig a little further, about I switched over the ‘Forecast Convergence’ Widget in ez2view to look at how AEMO’s forecasts of aggregate wind availability (via AWEFS) had converged on the actual values for each trading period: I’ve annotated this to explain a bit more – however one of the main points to note is that (on this occasion) reality turned out to be a little bit more pessimistic than successive AEMO AWEFS forecasts, in terms of when (and to what extent) wind would kick back up from its low production point just at the start of the price spike period. Story 2 = Wind production through the period peaked at only 21% Instantaneous Capacity Factor That’s only part of the story, however – what’s not shown on the chart for wind, as it would have shrunk the y-axis and made Story 1 more difficult to see, is that the aggregate Maximum Capacity of all the wind farms installed in South Australia on this day was 2,138MW. This means that the aggregate contribution from wind at the start of the >$1,000/MWh pricing run was under 10% of the maximum capacity of all the units installed across South Australia. The lack of wind was having the effect of these assets ‘bidding themselves at infinity’ and is one of the main reasons why the prices were able to spike so high. So, whilst we might like to point fingers at our favourite Villain below we need to remember that its the disappearance of competitive tension when the market really needed it that enabled these price spikes to eventuate. We need to be aware that both stories are relevant and important . Unless, and until, we truly consider the implications of each, then we’re going to continue to find this energy transition very difficult to manage . 3d) How did the Batteries perform Remember that it’s not just a playground for the ‘world’s biggest battery’ (which you can watch live on the Hornsdale Power Reserve website in an ez2view widget at the bottom of the page , thanks to Neoen) – by which I mean that there are a couple batteries in South Australia now – I have attached a similar chart showing the aggregate output of all of the batteries in the South Australian region ( your copy of this Batteries query is here ): I haven’t worried about showing the charging side of things in this case – but clients using ez2view or NEMreview can take the starting point linked and add this in themselves. Out of curiosity I thought I would dig further, and use the ‘Unit Dashboard’ Widget in ez2view ( v7.4.5.623 for future reference, as it is rapidly evolving ) to look in detail at each of the batteries – firstly starting with Lake Bonney BESS (operated by Infigen Energy) as I had not spent as much time looking at this: The main point here (excuse the busyness for those unfamiliar with the widget) is that the battery was able to dispatch up near the maximum capacity the whole way through the >$1,000/MWh price range. Also annotated is that the form of these rebids are ‘Not Well Formed (Strict)’ or ‘Well Formed (Loose)’ according to our interpretation of the AER Rebidding Guidelines. In our (a couple weeks from release) Generator Statistical Digest 2019 , we will be presenting a comprehensive automated categorisation of how all rebids for CAL 2019 – for all units – fit into each of these categories. Flipping then to Dalrymple North BESS (operated by AGL Energy) we see a different picture: It seems clear from this picture that this battery was spent well before the end of the price spike period. Also annotated is that the form of these rebids are ‘Not Well Formed (Loose)’ according to our interpretation of the AER Rebidding Guidelines. See more in the Generator Statistical Digest 2019 . Last, but by no means least, we look at Hornsdale Power Reserve (operated by Neoen and Tesla) and see that this also had to bid itself out of the market because of state of charge – though it lasted a little longer (fully done by 19:25) than Dalrymple (off by 18:50) Note that these bids were ‘Well Formed (Strict)’ according to our interpretation of the AER Rebidding Guidelines. See more in the Generator Statistical Digest 2019 . I don’t have time to dig further on the batteries – but I am interested to understand the relative energy densities of the three (perhaps some reader can help, in a comment). I guess this is the reason why Lake Bonney BESS lasted longer? 3e) How did the Gas-Fired Gens perform? Here’s a similar trend using NEMreview v7 showing aggregate contribution from gas-fired generators ( your copy of the Gas Gen query file here ): We see that (collectively) the production from gas generators ramped up steadily through the day to meet the peak in demand (and price) – and that, at the time of the peak, there was a little more than 300MW of spare capacity. Out of curiosity, because it’s new, I flipped the ez2view ‘Station Dashboard’ widget to look at the Barkers Inlet peaking station: The biggest thing that jumps out to me here is the significant volume of capacity that’s not available at all over that period – for reasons that I have not explored further. Using the same widget I then had a quick look at the whole of Torrens Island (also operated by AGL Energy): We see here that the 395MW of spare capacity at Torrens (which is pretty much all that’s spare across the whole of South Australia) is bid up at the Market Price Cap. Note also the 20MW increase in volume offered there at the 18:35 dispatch interval. In that dispatch interval the price rises fully to Market Price Cap when the AEMO needs to access 1MW of that volume. 3f) How did the Liquid-fueled peakers perform? Finally we quickly look at the aggregate output from liquid-fueled peaking plant ( your copy of the Liquid Gen query file here ): Note that there is a dip of around 30MW or so in output during the early part of the price spike – for reasons that spark a bit of curiosity, so back to the ‘Unit Dashboard widget in ez2view and look particularly at SNUG1 (the unit at Snuggery Power Station – operated by Engie): Apologies for the busyness here (and lack of time to thoroughly explain) but the key point is that Snuggery is being constrained down (along with other Scheduled and Semi-Scheduled generation in the south-east of South Australia under Constraint Equation ‘V^^S_NIL_MAXG_1’ to protect South Australia – voltage stability – in the case of the loss of the largest generation block in SA (assuming South East Capacitor Available)). See the note in the image about ‘ Off-Target ‘ and ‘ Compliance Status ‘. In our (a couple weeks from release) Generator Statistical Digest 2019 , we will be presenting a comprehensive categorisation of both derived measures (for all units, for all dispatch intervals) through CAL 2019. There’s other stuff going on, but I have run out of time to explore and explain… (C) Why did it happen on Thursday in South Australia – but not on Wednesday in Victoria? This is perhaps the more interesting question for me – but I’ll have to dig a little deeper on this one and (depending on how many other distractions the market throws up in what should be a quieter period the next 2 weeks) might have another article up during that period…",

    "date": "19-12-2019 03:41:00 PM",
    "content": "Kicking off from the last quarter of 2016 Australia has experienced an amazing boom in renewable energy across both rooftop solar and utility-scale projects. Over the space of just five years Australia will have shifted from just 15% of our power from renewable energy (in 2016) to 30% by 2021. While this year’s megawatts of large scale commitments are down on 2017 and 2018 levels, at over 2,500MW to November, they stand many times higher than any other prior year. At the same time sub-100kW rooftop solar installation levels this year are staggering and on track for comfortably more than 2,000MW. What has been particularly pleasing to see has been the steadily falling prices of renewable energy under announced long-term contracts. Over the past 18 months we have a seen a steady stream of large corporate entities announcing deals to contract new wind and solar projects to lower their energy costs, not just to burnish the environmental image. Power contract prices announced for wind and solar projects in Australia since 2012 Source: Green Energy Markets Power Project Database The scale and speed of what has been achieved can be intoxicating for many of those who have battled over many years to get government to recognise the potential of renewable energy to affordably meet our needs for energy while containing global warming. Given there is room for plenty of further technological improvement, it can be tempting to believe that those tough times in the past are now all behind us, and we can look on to year after year of new heights. Unfortunately you’d be wrong. While the first chart above shows an aggregate picture that looks incredibly rosy, hidden within it is a canary in the coal mine – Queensland. If we extract Queensland’s renewable energy commitments out from the aggregate, we see something very troubling. In 2019 construction commitments to large wind and solar farms in Queensland completely dried-up. Investment in LGC-registered projects to November stands at a paltry 29MW and is almost entirely confined to behind-the-meter rooftop solar systems. The figure below illustrates the implications for employment, providing an estimate of the amount of full-time equivalent jobs engaged in construction of utility-scale (5 megawatts or greater) renewable energy projects. The renewable energy project commitments since 2016 led to a surge in construction activity and employment which likely peaked in November 2018 at about 2,900 full time equivalent jobs. Since then employment has fallen precipitously as solar farms in particular, have reached completion. As of November this year we estimate employment will have dropped below 1,000 full time equivalents. Once Coopers Gap Wind Farm is likely to be completed around April next year, employment will have fallen to zero unless we see a complete turnaround in investment commitments. Queensland utility-scale (5MW+) renewable energy construction jobs by month January 2016 to December 2020 Source: Green Energy Markets estimates based on renewable energy job creation factors per megawatt of capacity as detailed in our Renewable Energy Index . Construction jobs are distributed equally across the months of each project’s respective construction period. What’s behind this collapse in investment and is it likely to spread? The first thing to keep in mind is that the boom in large-scale renewable energy investment in Queensland was part of a broader national trend. In 2016 prices for renewable energy certificates (known as LGCs) had surged above $80 per MWh reflecting the fact that we were a long way short of having enough projects to meet the Australia-wide 2020 Renewable Energy Target. We have now put in place so much new capacity that the Renewable Energy Target will be substantially oversupplied by 2022. Consequently the price for renewable energy certificates have collapsed and those scheduled for delivery in 2022 are changing hands at $15, while 2023 certificates are worth $10. Nothing is traded beyond that year but you could confidently expect they’d be worth even less. The reality is that if you’re considering construction of a new renewable energy project, by the time it is likely to be built you’ll receive little to no financial benefit from the fact that it reduces Australia’s emissions unless policy changes. The second part of the equation comes down to electricity prices. Since 2017 wholesale power prices have been very high, indeed substantially higher than the contract prices that renewable energy projects have required to proceed. This has helped fuel optimism that renewable energy investment could continue to boom even if we had no meaningful emission reduction policy. What many may forget is that it wasn’t all that long ago that Federal government politicians, electricity companies and even AEMO’s former CEO Matt Zema complained that we had too much electricity generating capacity. In 2015 power prices in Victoria used to average just $34 per megawatt-hour (time-weighted) and in NSW they averaged $39. At that time Queensland actually had the highest power prices of the NEM states at $52, although this is still very low compared to 2017 and 2018. The chart below details the average price solar generation in each state would receive for its power relative to the 24 hour average on the wholesale market for that state. It shows power prices leapt incredibly after 2016. Across NSW, Victoria and South Australia prices since 2017 are well above the kind of prices we are hearing about for recent solar power purchase agreements. Even in the case of Queensland we see that the average price received up to September this year at $60 sits above recent PPA prices.

But if you delve into wholesale power price data over the last few months you see something suddenly change. Below is the average Queensland wholesale price by hour of the day (24hour clock) covering January until July across each year since 2015. 2019 is shown in red and it looks very similar to 2016 and 2018 and is well above the depressed prices of 2015 shown in dark blue. So seems like not much to worry about. Queensland Wholesale Power Prices by hour of the day averaged across January to July Source: Green Energy Markets Analysis with NEMreview for source data. But since August during the middle of the day, when solar power output peaks, Queensland appears to have gone back in time to market conditions akin to or worse than the oversupply conditions of 2015.

Editor’s Note: On WattClarity® we ran a series of articles considering the escalation of negative priced events on 30th August , 4th September , 5th September , and 6th September . Victoria and NSW over these same months have not experienced this same solar-generation price depression effect, but South Australia most definitely has. In addition, Western Australia’s Electricity Market is experiencing a similar effect in its short-term balancing market as shown by comparing 2018 prices by hour versus those of 2014. For 2019 up until mid-September Western Australia’s balancing market had recorded negative prices between 10am and 2pm for slightly more than 1 in every 7 days (44 days out of 254). Average Western Australian STEM prices by hour – 2014 vs 2018 Source: Green Energy Markets Analysis with AEMO for source data Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia are at the leading edge of this solar price depression effect because solar capacity represents a larger proportion of electricity demand in these states, compared to Victoria, NSW and Tasmania. But NSW has now overtaken Queensland in terms of solar farm and rooftop solar capacity additions. Victoria has also substantially stepped up its level of rooftop solar installations. At present these two states don’t have the same level of excess coal generating capacity that Queensland has, but they are adding a lot more wind generating capacity. Ultimately, they too will see depressed prices in the middle of the day. Victoria (and South Australia) will also see an increasingly significant wind generation price depression effect. This is great news for electricity consumers. Unfortunately though, it means NSW and Victoria will likely follow Queensland’s footsteps of a renewable energy investment collapse in a year or so’s time. The one caveat is that maybe our governments’ will take their climate change commitments seriously, or another coal generator calls it quits. Editor’s Note: It seems likely that there are other factors impacting on the development of renewables development in Queensland region – such as various after-effects of siting decisions that saw the majority of developments constructed in northern Queensland, which suffers from its own sub-set of challenges . ————- About our Guest Author Tristan Edis is the Director – Analysis & Advisory at Green Energy Markets .

    "content": "As a short PS to yesterday’s article about high Queensland demand, I included a passing comment about these two market notices talking about AEMO’s Low Reserve Condition warnings issued via AEMO’s Market Notices on Monday for Wednesday afternoon/evening in the Victorian region: Market Notice Content Creation Date: 16/12/2019 12:52:01 Notice ID 71855 The Market Notice said: ——————————– AEMO declares a Forecast LOR2 condition under clause 4.8.4(b) of the National Electricity Rules for the Victoria region for the following period: From 1630 hrs to 1800 hrs on 18/12/2019. The forecast capacity reserve requirement is 1,015 MW. The minimum capacity reserve available is 936 MW. AEMO is seeking a market response. AEMO has not yet estimated the latest time it would need to intervene through an AEMO intervention event.

Danushka Sooriyadasa AEMO Operations ——————————– In particular, note that this alert was for an LOR2 condition These notices followed an earlier notice warning of high temperatures: Market Notice Content Creation Date : 16/12/2019 09:57:57 Notice ID : 71854 The Market Notice said: ——————————– Refer to AEMO Electricity Market Notice No. 71778, 71813 and 71814. AEMO’s weather service provider has issued forecast temperatures for Queensland (QLD), New South Wales (NSW), Victoria (VIC) and South Australia (SA) regions that are equal to or greater than the Generation Capacity Reference Temperatures: QLD: On 16/12/2019: Maximum forecast temperature 41 degrees C at Archerfield for the Brisbane area.

Also, note that elevated temperatures are forecast in some locations within the QLD, NSW, VIC and SA regions from 16/12/2019 to 22/12/2019. Further updates to this advice may not be provided. … <SNIP> ——————————– So the AEMO forecasts extreme temperatures for the Victorian region on Friday this week – and we explored in our Generator Report Card 2018 how extreme temperatures affect the capability of almost all infrastructure (including some that might surprise those who are not so closely involved ) . Yet the Low Reserve Condition Notices published on Monday afternoon relate to two days earlier (Wednesday this week). Promises to be an challenging week – and that’s just for Victoria! (A) In the media There’s three articles in the media that I noticed that were of particular interest: Article #1 = Late on Sunday 15th for Monday morning, Mark Ludlow wrote in the AFR about “ ’No room for anything to break’ this summer: AEMO ” – in this article Mark notes that: AGL Energy’s chief financial officer Damien Nicks confirmed to investors late last week that the 2210-megawatt Loy Yang A will return to operation on a limited capacity on Monday and then crank up to full capacity within a few days. … and: AGL executive general manager Doug Jackson said repair teams had worked hard to get Loy Yang A back up to speed before Christmas. “Work on the Loy Yang Unit 2 generator is expected to finish on the 16th of December. The unit will be ramped sequentially, synched by the 18th, reaching full load by the 19th,” Mr Jackson said. … now it is worth noting that (assuming all went to this plan) we could not expect to see any output from the plant hit the grid until Wednesday 18th December (i.e. after the plant had synchronised with the grid). So it was not a surprise to me that we did not see any output yesterday. Later on Monday there were two follow-up articles that I noted: Article #2 = on Monday afternoon, Sophie Vorrath wrote on RenewEconomy predicting “ Loy Yang A unit returns, just in time for another blistering heat-wave ” noting that a return-to-service date was going to be on Thursday this week and including this statement: In an emailed statement to RenewEconomy on Monday, AGL’s executive general manager of group operations, Doug Jackson, said some “final minor mechanical work” on the unit would be completed Wednesday, with generation set to begin on Thursday then progressively ramp up in load. … so I noted a slightly later date in what’s been quoted from AGL between the two articles. Not really a surprise, given the complexities of the repair process (and fingers crossed the return goes well). Article #3 = at the end of the day on Monday, Angela Macdonald-Smith wrote in the AFR about “ Victoria on a knife-edge as Loy Yang repair slips ” implying more directly a slippage in the implied return-to-service date: AGL, which had originally expected to resume operations at Unit 2 at Loy Yang A on Monday, said it now expects the 560-megawatt unit to start generating on Thursday although it has completed the major part of the work. … however I have some vague memory rattling around in my head that the AEMO had previously been talking about a 20th December operational date for Loy Yang A2 in any case ( Allan’s note on 21st November references a prior AGL Investor presentation noting that Monday 16th December was when ‘major works (were) expected to be complete’ – so not much change from what we see this week?) (B) In the market data A quick tour around some selective market data today (Tuesday morning 17th December) reveals a few things: (B1) The time horizon for the Low Reserve Condition has been extended According to Market Notices issued earlier today, we’re currently looking at a longer period of Low Reserve Condition that forecast yesterday afternoon: LOR 1 (Lack of Reserve Level 1) It is now looking (via Market Notice 71862, correcting 71860) that we’ll be at LOR1 (or LOR2, see below) from 15:00 through until 19:00 on Wednesday. LOR 2 (Lack of Reserve Level 2) It’s now looking (via Market Notice 71861) like we’ll be at LOR2 level from 15:30 to 18:30 on Wednesday afternoon/evening (i.e. longer than forecast on Monday) – with the minimum capacity reserve available being 580MW (i.e. lower than forecast on Monday). At 10:58:16 the AEMO issued a Generator Recall Notice (via Market Notice 71863) to cover the period 13:00 on Wednesday. LOR 3 (Lack of Reserve Level 3) Not currently forecast Worth remembering the various levels of severity in the Low Reserve Condition notices . (B2) The supply/demand gap is forecast to be larger on Wednesday than on Friday Here’s a current trend of the supply and demand situation forecast for the Victorian region over the coming 7 days: We can clearly see that the demand is forecast to be considerably higher on Wednesday and Friday than any other day over this two-week period. It’s marginally higher on Friday, but we also see that the forecast available generation capacity is forecast to be higher on Friday as well – which would be one reason for the LOR2 forecast (currently) for Wednesday but not Friday. Note that the “demand” measure shown in this trend is “Demand and Non-Scheduled Generation”. Recall these gory details of the various different measures of such a seemingly simple concept of electricity demand. Those readers with a licence to ez2view can access their own copy of this live trend here . Using the ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget in the installed ez2view software and showing the same measure of demand, we can see that the forecast peak demand (on that measure) for Wednesday is more than 300MW lower than the (higher) peak in demand forecast for Wednesday on Saturday evening – however it is strengthening again (see prior discussion about some of the inherent challenges AEMO faces in forecasting demand ): (B3) Capacity availability The other side of the supply/demand equation is the available generation capacity, so flipping to view this in Forecast Convergence we see a lift in aggregate Available Generation capacity forecast for around 14:00 on Wednesday (i.e. just before the LOR1 condition starts) – and also around the same time on Friday afternoon: Also flagged is a decrease in aggregate Available Generation forecast for the VIC region over the period from Wednesday afternoon through until Friday afternoon which is around 500MW in magnitude – which will have some guessing (as we currently can’t know*) that this might be due to a delay in AGL’s expected operational time for Loy Yang A2. (B4) Forecast Surplus (or Deficit in the case of Wednesday in Victoria) Combining the two produces the AEMO’s view of the local surplus in the region – which is also seen in Forecast Convergence inside of ez2view: So Wednesday is currently forecast to be in a ‘worse’ position than Friday. (B5) Watch first operations at Loy Yang A2 Those readers with a licence to ez2view can watch their own live trend that will show Loy Yang A2 output (along with the other 3 units) as soon as the it hits the AEMO’s Market Management System. This same trend is also available for those with a licence to the more basic NEMreview trending functionality . (C) Making the market data better (from * above) What’s going on this week is yet another reminder of how the market as a whole (by which I mean not just all the wholesale participants, but also all the others who are stakeholders in outcomes from what happens in the wholesale market – first and foremost being all the energy users) would be so much more better informed if they had visibility of what AGL Energy (and all the other generators) are submitting in their three-hourly updates to MT PASA generation availability forecasts. This was something proposed by ERM Power to the AEMC in March 2019, and for which we expressed support on 15th August and on 18th November . We wrote about this type of thing in our Generator Report Card 2018 : Submissions close on Thursday 9th January 2020 at the AEMC on this one.",

    "content": "A quick note today (which might be updated later, time permitting) to include the following snapshot from NEMwatch v10 to note the Scheduled Demand up at 9,431MW in the 15:20 dispatch interval (still 600MW below the all-time maximum set just last summer): ————————————————————————- PS – a few additional points, added a little later ————————————————————————- 1) Temperature turn-around The following trend view from ez2view provides an illustration of quite a rapid decline in temperatures in the south-east corner through the afternoon (to the relief of many), which also reversed the course of what had been rapidly rising electricity demand in the Queensland region to that point: As a result of this, the Scheduled Demand peaked at ‘only’ 9,434MW in the 15:25 dispatch interval (5 minutes after the snapshot shown above). Licensed users of ez2view can access their own copy of this live trend here . 2) An illustration of the challenges in demand forecasting Noting ( as previously noted here ) that it’s important to think about these as ‘discrepancies’ or ‘deviations’ from demand forecast – rather than an ‘error’ – we use the ‘Forecast Convergence’ Widget in the installed ez2view software to highlight these two views of the turn-around in the demand trajectory: On a half-hourly basis, we see the demand declined (on this basis) between 16:00 and 16:30. A tabular view enables the user to read the actual numbers, so we flipped to this view (and also zoomed in to see results on a dispatch interval basis): 3) Demand rebounding as the sun (and solar PV injections) sets Also worth noting that it’s become fairly common to see this sort of rebound in demand a little later in the day, as shown in this snapshot from NEMwatch v10 at the 16:50 dispatch interval This proceeds to provide a “two hump” peak in demand which we have begun to see fairly regularly through Queensland summers. Note that this NEMwatch v10 image shows APVI’s estimates for rooftop solar PV but ( as explored here ) it may be that the APVI estimates are significantly underdone – in which case the rate of decline in the late afternoon period would also be significantly underdone as well. 4) Sweating on the return of Loy Yang A2 in Victoria Finally, we see a few Market Notices warning of Low Reserve Condition forecast for Victoria for Wednesday this week (18th December).

    "content": "On just the second day of the summer, Queensland has had it’s first price spike of the season. As seen in the screenshot from NEM-Watch v10 below, the spot price for the state hit $1,411.69 for the 16:40 interval on Monday afternoon. From our quick initial investigation, it seems that intervention pricing was in effect during the interval, and that the OAKEY1 unit set the price but was not dispatched – if time allows we will look to publish more analysis on this interval. The price spike occurred while total demand for the state reached 8,370 MW. The record for peak total demand in QLD is 10,052 MW which was set in March of this year. Looking at the chart we’ve made in NEMreview v7 below, we can see that peak demand in Queensland has been rising steadily over the second half of the past decade, with the record for peak demand being broken in each of the past four consecutive summers.

    "title": "New supply in the NEM – what’s happening?",
    "date": "02-12-2019 11:52:00 AM",
    "content": "Key takeaways: Commissioning activity has been strong in 2019 – lots of new capacity has hit full output, with ramp-up and testing periods for completed projects on a par with previous years But recent commissioning is slower than we anticipated: wind projects currently progressing though the process are taking longer than average Grid connections have slowed down, with 1 GW less energised this year compared to last Construction is not the problem – physical build times seem to be speeding up, especially for solar That leaves us with grid connection problems, most likely due to the sheer scale of activity facing both network service providers and the market operator We therefore expect a slower schedule for the 4.8 GW currently under construction – but it is coming Background The recent growth in utility scale renewables in Australia has clearly been a massive success: 5.4 GW connected over the past three years is good going, and at ITK we continue to emphasise to clients how this is pushing down wholesale electricity prices. However, the pointy end of project development has been clouded by a lot more negativity over recent months than we remember seeing for a while. There are longer term concerns: MLFs, future market redesign and, dare we say it, federal energy policy are all keeping people awake at night. But over the nearer term, with a large stock of projects under construction, the anecdotal chat has been around difficulties connecting to the grid. So using our detailed knowledge of renewable projects and with the help of NEMreview’s unparalleled data set we decided to dig in and see what’s going on. Commissioning stays strong, but connections drop We estimate that 2 GW of wind and solar capacity has been fully commissioned in 2019. Estimating this is not as easy as it may sound, as we rarely get official confirmation of the commissioning date of a project. So we use NEM Review’s project level production data to estimate when each project is operating at an unrestricted level. Typically we consider a plant to be unrestricted if it’s output level is consistently at or above 85% of notional capacity (although this will vary by season for solar). Commissioning performance in 2019 has been on a par with the previous year’s total of 2.1 GW. And while we saw no new capacity fully commissioned in October, over 200 MW has been commissioned in November as Finley solar farm in New South Wales and Clermont solar farm in Queensland have both hit their straps. This makes November the fourth largest month for commissioning over the past two years. So far, so good. But what about new connections (energisaions) to the grid, and why the October hiatus in commissioning? In contrast to commissioning performance, energisations are well down on last year. So far, 1.9 GW of wind and solar has been energised, so we can safely conclude that grid connections will be no match for the 2.9 GW connected in a record breaking 2018. However, on the plus side 2019 has still featured the busiest single month for grid connections, with a stunning 708 MW connected in June. The slow-down in new projects is most apparent in the monthly data, with nothing connected in October or November, and in fact only 188 MW energised in the second half of the year (so far). This is our first clue to what happened in October. On average over the past two and a half years, it has taken 3.3 months for a solar farm to progress through the commissioning process, and 5.6 months on average for a wind farm. With the absence of new connections in July 2019, it should probably be no surprise that no capacity reached full output in October, three months later. And with no grid connections in October and November, we can probably expect a quiet January and February from a commissioning perspective. But we saw a major surge in energisations in June 2019, which has to ramp up to full capacity at some point – so is the commissioning process slowing down? Despite the wide range of commissioning performances, the trend for solar is downwards for most states – Queensland, which of course has the largest number of utility solar plants, is experiencing slightly faster average commissioning timeframes in 2019 than the previous year. The same is true for South Australia and Victoria, although the much smaller sample sizes make it hard to draw concrete conclusions. Projects in New South Wales have experienced longer testing periods on average for this year compared to last, but both projects fully commissioned in 2019 were still done in well under 4 months. Wind plants take longer to move through the commissioning process than solar, most likely due to their larger average capacity, and the nature of bringing individual turbines online. Since June 2017 wind commissioning timeframes have ranged from under one month up to 14 months. And while new wind project commissionings have been few and far between compared to solar, the second half of 2018 saw several projects come in well under this average. But a key issue here is the time it is taking to commission wind plants which have been energised in 2019 but not yet commissioned . Four wind plants – with a combined capacity of almost 1 GW – are currently progressing through commissioning, all of which are either close to or have already exceeded the average wind testing period (as calculated using the number of days from energization to the time of writing). So while the commissioning process seems to be having only a limited impact on solar project capacity reaching the market, it is having a more acute impact on wind. And given the larger average size of wind projects, this is showing up in the commissioning data. Longer testing periods for wind help explain why the June spike in energisations is not yet flowing through into full capacity in the NEM. Grid connection is the challenge But why has energised capacity dropped off so much in the second half of the year? Project construction certainly hasn’t dried up: we estimate 4.8 GW of utility wind and solar is currently being built, which is equal to the total capacity connected to the grid over the past 2 years. Construction activity has slowed down: 2.2 GW of new capacity entered construction in 2019 compared to the staggering 4.2 GW in 2018. But 2 GW+ in a year still strikes us as a healthy growth rate. (We need to add another caveat here. Estimating construction start dates is a dark art, as there are various different triggers we can use, and relatively few public announcements. We consider a contractor’s notice-to-proceed (NTP) as sufficient, although in reality actual work on the ground may not occur for several months. And preparatory tasks conducted under an ‘early works’ arrangement muddies the data waters for us – we do not include it as construction, although we recognize that it can speed up the actual build time once NTP has been given.) July and November 2019 are the only months over the past two years that have featured no construction starts for wind and solar. But with such a large stock of projects currently being built, and significant construction activity in the final quarter of 2018, perhaps construction delays are responsible for the slowdown in connections. On average since the beginning of 2017, it has taken 13 months to get a solar farm from the start of construction to energization (bearing in mind our earlier point about the difficulty in estimating accurate construction start dates). The absolute minimum has been seven months, with the maximum an eye-watering 22 months. Of the 35 connected solar plants we’re looking at over the period in question, 15 were constructed and connected in under a year. In general solar construction timeframes have been getting faster in all states, which is perhaps no surprise given how fast construction contractors in Australia had to get up the learning curve. Projects that commenced construction in 2017 took an average of 14 months to be built and connected; this fell to 9 months for projects that started in 2018. However, none of the projects which have started construction in 2019 have yet been energised. There are currently 20 utility scale projects under construction, and the average construction time so far has been 9.5 months. This is already longer than the average for projects completed in 2018, and we need to remember that the 2019 average is dragged down by a selection of projects that were started very recently. Of the 20, six have already taken longer than 13 months, with three projects either approaching or exceeding 18 months. The story is similar for wind. The average construction time for completed wind projects in our sample is 12 months – surprisingly, faster than solar. But projects currently under construction that are yet to be energised are lagging well behind this average. The average construction period to date for wind plants currently being built is already 12.6 months. And if we look at projects which commenced in 2018 (accounting for 1.5 GW of capacity), the average build time blows out to 17 months. Is construction really taking longer for the current crop of projects? For solar, we suspect not. We can observe build times for recent plants such as Beryl, Finley, and Numurkah of approximately 9 months, along with similar performances for some solar farms completed in 2018. So while we acknowledge that each project is unique and will face it’s own specific challenges, we see little reason why physical completion for an average project should extend beyond 12 months. This leaves us with grid connection problems. Solar projects are entering construction – albeit at a slower pace – and there is some evidence to suggest construction times are getting quicker. But proponents are struggling to get them connected. Wind is perhaps more complicated – some of the projects currently being built are very large, which may influence average construction times. It probably should not be surprising that construction at the 530 MW Stockyard Hill wind farm has taken 18 months to date, when the 435 MW Coopers Gap project took 22 months to complete. With wind accounting for such a large slab of current construction projects – 2.9 GW, or 60% of the total – and with a larger average wind project size compared to solar (191 MW compared to 98 MW) – we suggest that wind project construction times, plus solar grid connection problems, are the primary reasons for the current slowdown in energisations. What about the near-term outlook? Get in touch if you would like to talk specifics. We forecast 5.8 GW of projects that are either under construction or otherwise committed to development, and we apply construction and commissioning timeframes that are informed by our analysis of current project performance. Most of this capacity will come online gradually over the next 18 months, with a strong focus on Victorian wind, and New South Wales solar. And what impact will this new supply have on price? Well that’s one for another time, but if you can’t wait, drop us a line at ITK to discuss how we can help you understand the future of the NEM. ——————————————- About our Guest Author Ben Willacy is a consultant and analyst at ITK Services.

    "title": "The (ongoing!) opacity of distributed, small-scale solar PV output",
    "date": "02-12-2019 08:34:00 AM",
    "content": "Back on 17th June 2016 (42 months ago) I posted this article about “The opacity of distributed, small-scale solar PV output” . In recent times there have been several different catalysts emerge to prompt me to provide this update to a challenge that is not going away – but instead might be (in some ways) becoming worse ! (A) Part of a broader Analytical Challenge In our Generator Report Card 2018 we saw the opacity of small-scale PV as one manifestation of a broader challenge that is growing in scale and significance as the NEM evolution progresses – sufficient enough to specifically draw attention to this as Theme 14 within Part 2 in the broader analytical side of the report. In Theme 14, we explored a number of different examples where we have seen, and experienced, how “the transitional challenges require greatly enhanced Analytical Capability” : In this theme we have explored a number of discrete examples which all (in our view) illustrate why the NEM is in urgent need of an upgraded analytical capability – and one we’re working busily to help to facilitate through our software tools (like the ez2view higher-end dashboard tool). (B) Several aspects of Opacity Throughout the Generator Report Card 2018 , we came to the (necessarye) conclusion that we could only include a single illustration throughout all 530 pages that had anything to do with the contribution of rooftop PV – which was Figure 2-1 copied here: The reason why we had to (sadly) come to the conclusion that we had to omit consideration of rooftop PV was that we do not have sufficient confidence in the accuracy of the (various!) estimates widely available for the contributions for rooftop PV. This is (in our view) beginning to become a more serious consideration for the NEM moving forwards, which (in our view) needs to be addressed. (B1) Questions Two questions to sum up one of the reasons for our concern … Q1) Hands up who knew…? … that there were (back in June 2016) two different high-profile estimates available for contribution from rooftop PV, then there were four for a period of time, and now we are back to “only” three? Q2) Hands up who also knew…? … that these different estimates vary from each other by as much as 200% ! (B2) Huge differences …. which not many are even aware of ! To me the main story in the above is not that there are such large differences in these estimates – but moreso that most people are not even aware of the difficulties (and hence uncertainties) inherent in forming these estimates . As a result of this we are concerned there are a growing number of people amongst energy sector stakeholders who are thinking with a false sense of accuracy that they ‘know’ how the level of contribution from rooftop PV at any given point in time. This (in our view) has increasing risk of making our energy sector transition harder to complete, unless we find ways of addressing this … (B3) So it was a notable omission in the GRC2018 (we sadly felt we needed to make) It was a conscious choice we needed to make to omit any data on the contribution of rooftop PV from our Generator Report Card 2018 – this was not a happy choice to make , but one we felt compelled to make as we (sadly) do not currently have a great deal of faith in the veracity of the various estimates for rooftop PV. Given we had invested an enormous amount of time in ensuring that the insights shared through the Generator Report Card 2018 were based on rigorous analysis of a meticulously prepared data set transformed from a cleaned AEMO MMS database, it would not have been good practice to drop our standards for precision/accuracy to consider insights about rooftop PV when one cannot currently be sure about the numbers. We also feel that is is necessary to omit any consideration of rooftop PV from the updates we are currently completing to this data set – as part of the production of the Generator Statistical Digest 2019 for release in January 2020. (C) Some specific examples To illustrate how these types of uncertainties should come to light in discussions amongst the broader group of energy sector stakeholders, but do not , here are three examples: (C1) Saturday 26th October in South Australia On 25th November 2019, I posted this article about exploring AEMO’s demand forecast discrepancy a month earlier (on Saturday 26th October 2019). In that article I included this trend from three different estimates (two from AEMO and one from APVI) which show a wide degree of variability in estimating what the contribution actually was on Saturday 26th October: It’s clear to see that (on this particular day) the various estimates were almost 200% apart, in terms of the estimated contribution from rooftop PV: (a) The APVI estimate was considerably lower, peaking just over 400MW for discrete 5 minute instances; whereas (b) The AEMO estimates (two different methods) both peaked over 700MW. Can anyone actually tell me which magnitude is correct? There is a huge difference between these estimates! Editor’s Note: Subsequent to this article, our data feed from the APVi was upgraded to use a newer estimation methodology that had the effect of moving the estimate from the APVi up closer to (but still not the same as) the AEMO estimate. . Common sense suggests that the correct answer is that none of them will be perfectly correct – but I have no real basis for judging whether the “actual” contribution is more towards the lower end of the forecast range (from the APVI) or more towards the higher range (from the AEMO). Or maybe it is higher than the AEMO estimate, or lower than the APVI one? (a) On what basis would we really know? (b) Surely we owe it to ourselves to be reducing the uncertainties about this, moving forwards? There is a difference in the cadence of the data (i.e. AEMO estimates are published on 30-minute time steps, whereas APVI estimates are published on 5-minute time steps). However, even taking into account the shorter time-steps for the APVi estimates it’s clear to see that the APVI data set has a much less smooth shape over the day in question. Can anyone actually tell me which shape is correct? Given the time spent watching the output of our own rooftop solar power station at home (thanks Solar Analytics and WattWatchers!) there are plenty of days where we see more jagged patterns – but also days where we see a copybook smoother shapes that look like they have come from the sales brochure (probably too many of those days in recent months for Brisbane, given the absence of sorely-needed rainfall). (a) Do they actually average out, over a large area (as the AEMO seems to be suggesting with their estimate) – or does the diversity itself actually make “bumpiness” more likely (as the APVI data suggests)? (b) How would one actually “know”? Given the non-trivial contribution rooftop PV is now making, and the fact that this contribution is set to grow significantly in the coming years, surely it’s in our interests to be investing focused resources to actually determine the answers to these questions? We’re fast approaching the time (perhaps past the time, on specific days like the following) where a better understanding would be more than just an academic exercise. We’re entering an environment where it matters in the real world! (C2) Wednesday 6th November – when the NEM was powered by 50% renewables (maybe more, maybe less?) Late on 6th November 2019, Giles Parkinson noted on RenewEconomy a milestone with an article “Australia’s main grid reaches 50 per cent renewables for first time” on 6th November . This followed some short snippets on social media, and was also echoed in several mainstream media locations, including: 1) this article in the ABC by Markus Mannheim on 7th November . 2) Graham Readfearn with this article in the Guardian on 7th November . In Giles’ article he includes a snapshot from the OpenNEM trend focused on what Giles thought was* 11:50 NEM time on Wednesday 6th November – which I have copied below with annotations: It’s worth noting a few things here in relation to the image above: 1) Firstly (as noted * above) Giles interpreted the diagram as showing data that pertained to 11:50 NEM time on Wednesday 6th November, however this appears not to be the case. We suspect that there’s an easy-to-make ‘beginner’s mistake’ currently in the OpenNEM tool, in that it will use the PC’s own time clock to display data in that time but not alert the user to that in any way , which means that: (a) It is very easy for the user to (mistakenly) make suppositions like he has done; and (b) Makes it impossible for any user to actually know, with 100% confidence, the time that is actually displayed (e.g. because the timezone is not referenced as UTC+X on the image anywhere I can see). We understand others have also recently alerted OpenNEM to this. 2) Secondly, what appears to have been done is time-shift AEMO’s InitialMW back to the start of the dispatch interval in which it is started to make it an “actual”. (a) This is an understandable way of helping the user overcome some intricacies of dispatch intervals. (b) On this basis, the totals for the green boxes map correctly to the data summarised in the trend from NEMreview v7 shown below. 3) Finally, we note that the production rate shown for “Solar (Utility)” at this point in time (i.e. 2,126MW) appears to be 10MW too low compared with aggregate data published by AEMO (2,136MW) – so we presume that OpenNEM has omitted the contribution of a particular solar farm in AEMO’s list for some reason? Here’s the equivalent (unstacked) trend in NEMreview v7 ( clients can open their own copy of the trend here ), with the exception being that we have included AEMO’s estimate using the “Measurement” methodology, and also the APVI’s (quite different) estimate: With particular respect to contributions from rooftop PV it appears that OpenNEM uses an estimate that is closer to the levels estimated by AEMO (again APVI estimates are about half) but we can’t deduce exactly where OpenNEM gets its estimate , as: 1) the ones we know of from the AEMO are only published with 30-minute cadence, and 2) interpolation does not give the exact number quoted by OpenNEM. Perhaps OpenNEM is using another different estimate for rooftop PV , which (if so) would not appear to be helping to reduce the confusion that surrounds the actual contribution from rooftop PV. Perhaps a reader can help us out below in comments? (C3) Sunday 10th November – with 64% contribution from Rooftop PV in South Australia Just last week (Friday 29th November), Giles Parkinson wrote about “The day rooftop solar met two thirds of South Australia’s total demand” , referencing some information published by AEMO on Thursday 28th November in their “South Australian Electricity Report – November 2019”. (C3a) Record Low Operational Demand … but not Scheduled Demand! In particular, Giles’ article picked up on this image within the AEMO report that spoke of a record low in Operational Demand experienced on Sunday 10th November 2019: This prompted me to search for this article I’d written about “South Australia experiences lowest (non System Black) Scheduled Demand in at least 21 years” – and I see that it was posted a week earlier , on Sunday 3rd November 2019. Hence I powered up NEMreview v7 again to have a look at the trend of the three main measures of demand that the AEMO publishes: Here’s this query, for NEMreview v7 clients . We can see that the Scheduled was somewhat lower on Sunday 3rd November than it was on Sunday 10th November – but on Sunday 3rd November the Operational Demand figure was considerably higher than it was on Sunday 10th November (low point 458MW at 13:30 NEM time – so 14:00 in Adelaide). One more example of the complications of measuring demand ( as discussed here in some detail ). (C3b) Peak contribution from rooftop PV on Sunday 10th November 2019 In the page above the one shown in the AEMO document (i.e. page 25) the AEMO notes: “The most recent record, as seen in Figure 9, occurred on Sunday 10 November 2019 at 2:00 pm (Adelaide time). At this time, demand from the grid dipped to 458 MW (446 MW sent-out), South Australia was a net exporter, and the peak rooftop PV generation was 832 MW , or around 64% of the underlying operational demand. This day was a clear day, with high solar irradiance for the time of the year and daytime temperatures in low to mid 20s, but, being a weekend, a day with low commercial and industrial loads” With respect to rooftop PV I am particularly interested in the AEMO report noting that their estimate of the contribution from rooftop PV peaked at 832MW at 14:00 local time (so 13:30 NEM time). This enables us to include a similar, but unstacked, trend from NEMreview v7 , again also including the separate estimate from APVI for contribution in South Australia: Again, licensed users for NEMreview can access their copy of this query here . With respect to the thrust of this article, we note that the APVI estimate is just under half of the estimated used by AEMO. Also noted is a 95MW reduction in output from aggregate large-scale solar, which we presume was related to prices and commercial outcomes (but have not looked). (D) AEMO’s DER Register as the next (necessary) step – beginning Sunday 1st December 2019 Coincidentally yesterday (Sunday 1st December 2019) was the planned go-live date for the AEMO’s Distributed Energy Resource Register (i.e. DER Register). I’ve briefly discussed this here (on our Battery Storage site) , also linking to some context of how we had been involved in the earlier days of the broader project. We can see a clear and compelling need for something that operates successfully in this space: (1) First and foremost to provide a complete and up-to-date record of meta data pertaining to DER resources deployed across the NEM; and (2) Then, secondly, hopefully helping us do much better with operational data – to help us resolve some of these ongoing challenges with the opacity of DER, including rooftop PV. (E) Is it time to retire the APVI data feed? In parallel with the DER Register, and in the light of the growing differences between APVI numbers and those separate estimates being provided by the AEMO, I have been wondering increasingly if it is time to retire these APVI data feeds , to avoid ongoing confusion that we will have (inadvertently) become part of? The answer to that question is not as simple as it might initially seem, however – for a number of reasons including: Consideration #1) We don’t actually know whether AEMO is closer to reality than APVI! How would we (or anyone in the energy sector) be able to know this? There is a large and growing difference between the two estimates. Consideration #2) Neither AEMO, nor the APVI, provide access to a complete data series for estimated contributions As seen in Figure 2-1 at the top of this article, the AEMO data feed for estimated contribution from rooftop PV began in 2016 (hence my earlier article about “The opacity of distributed, small-scale solar PV output” ) and no provision has been made, as far as I am aware, to back-calculate this back to 2011… (a1) hence the dotted lines “indicative only” in Figure 2-1 copied above; and (a2) hence it was impossible to use AEMO estimates in performing a longitudinal study, such as in the Generator Report Card 2018 . We know that (because of the huge difference between APVI and AEMO estimates) we could not plausibly mesh the two estimates together at that particular date point. Indeed, whilst we do have a longitudinal data set that we have collected from APVI because of the data we have been receiving for many years, we do not have confidence in its fitness-for-purpose for longer term trending and analysis for a number of reasons including: (b1) there are gaps and discontinuities in the data (e.g. where their data feed has fallen over at various points in time, and not been back-filled); and (b2) more significantly, the APVI methodology has changed a number of times over the years (such as in the sampling technique changing from some data points to different points) and yet the historical trace has not been re-populated with a consistent methodology over the entire date range. As such our perspective has grown to be that, whilst the APVI data feed is of academic interest (and useful from a ‘general interest’ point of view), we would be concerned about any organisation or individuals making business decisions or major policy decisions on the basis of the data. In our view, the longer-term veracity of the data as a time-series is questionable, for the reasons above. We’d look forward to hearing from those who can help? (E1) What should we do, for our software and widgets? We utilise the APVI data in a range of different places – with the most widely used piece of software in question being our RenewEconomy-sponsored NEMwatch Live Supply & Demand Widget , which is: (a) Installed on RenewEconomy here ; (b) Installed on our sites in various places – like here on NEMwatch and here on WattClarity ; and (c) Installed on an every-growing number of other sites scattered across the internet. Because it was the only estimate that existed at the time, in 2015 we built the APVI estimates into the installed NEMwatch dashboard and also the RenewEconomy widget. We have had a time-series of the APVI’s estimates for rooftop PV injections on a 5-minute basis, along with AEMO’s estimates as well, in NEMreview v7 for some time (indeed the APVi data has been in NEMreview v6 beforehand ). However we are uncertain as to what approach we should be taking to these two different sources for estimated contributions from rooftop PV in future, in each of our products – or to other sources as well, if they exist (e.g. if OpenNEM uses a source we are not aware of?). Suggestions welcome ! (E2) What should happen, in the broader energy industry? More broadly, this seems like an area which requires additional focused (and coordinated) investment – in order to understand better the accuracies of the different methods that currently exist, to improve them, and to disseminate the results of these assessments so that stakeholders can be fully aware of the levels of accuracy/inaccuracy involved. (E3) Asia-Pacific Solar Research Conference (in Canberra this week) Coincidentally it might be worth noting that the 2019 Asia-Pacific Solar Research Conference is on in Canberra this week – Monday 2nd December through till Thursday 5th December 2019. It’s run by APVi and hosted by ANU. Perhaps delegates there can consider the questions posed above and feed back to me ?",

    "title": "Exploring AEMO’s demand forecast “error” for Saturday 26th October 2019",
    "date": "25-11-2019 09:13:00 AM",
    "content": "In the afternoon of Saturday 26th October 2019 I noted via this 1st article that AEMO had earlier forecast what would have been a record minimum demand for the South Australian region for at least 21 years (since the start of the NEM). However, as noted in the article the forecast turned out to be “off the mark” by about 200MW (a high relative “error” of 60% given demand was so low). We only had to wait a week (till Sunday 3rd November) to see the Scheduled Demand in South Australia down at a record low of 367MW , destroying the prior record for the same measure* as discussed in this follow-on 2nd article . Both articles have generated a fair degree of feedback (mostly direct), which has only helped to amplify our incessant curiosity… so (as time has permitted) we have continued to head-scratch and investigate… (A) Why are minimum demand, and a missed forecast, so important? It’s been a long time since we’ve given away a BBQ to the “best peak demand forecaster in the NEM” ( and this summer we don’t have the breathing space to crack open that popular distraction either). Speaking more seriously, though, there was a reason why we focused on peak demand NEM-wide all those years ago when we first established that competition – with a focus on peak NEM-wide demand . In simple terms, it was probably the single most important measure that played into so many different aspects of the evolution of the NEM over its first 10-15 years. It’s not become irrelevant in more recent years (though there has been an explosion in different measures used for “demand” more recently , for a range of reasons). What has happened, instead, is that there have emerged a significant number of other variables that are all also playing an increasingly significant role in leading outcomes in the National Electricity Market and broader electricity sector. This expansion of significant (interdependent) variables is one of the reasons why we highlighted, under Theme 2 in Part 2 of our Generator Report Card 2018 , that the level of Risk in the NEM is escalating : Rather than the (relatively) narrow focus on just relatively rare periods of extreme demand events, we’re shifting into an environment where there are a larger number of dispatch intervals where the NEM sees heightened risk because of a whole range of other factors, including: 1) (still) a question about what the peak demand will be – but also when it will occur (perhaps not so predictable as it might have been 10 years ago); 2) rising incidence of transmission congestion and the variability/volatility of transmission losses with our increasingly dispersed generation fleet; 3) much higher dependence of our generation fleet on different aspects of the weather, and our climate; 4) changes in pricing patterns as a result of various changes in bidding behaviours on top of the changes in the underlying physical realities ( discussed here and elsewhere); …. other factors N) and also, increasingly, concerns about what the minimum levels of demand would be for a region (or across the whole of the NEM). These minimum demand levels (and the extent to which it’s been “correctly” forecast) will increasingly feed into participant operating strategies, and also operating strategies for other organisations like the AEMO and NSPs. As with many data points in the NEM, the ability to forecast such things will assist in planning. (B) Why would the Demand Forecast “Error” have been so high? In my 1st article I deliberately did not use the term “error” to describe what happened on the day (for reasons discussed below) – but my understanding is that this did not stop some readers interpreting this as such. W e’re keen to explore (and its important for others to understand, more broadly) some of the reasons why the discrepancy would have been so substantial (especially in percentage terms). Here’s the same chart again, from the “Forecast Convergence” Widget in ez2view : In this grid: (a) The “actual” values for the half-hour are shown on the diagonal; (b) Prior predispatch forecasts for that same variable at that same time are shown in the rows underneath the diagonal; (c) Hence looking up a column (i.e. through successive forecasts) , we can see that the actual value for the 12:30 trading period was considerably higher than actual (d) To make this clearer, the low demand numbers are coloured deep blue whilst the higher numbers are coloured red – and it’s a sliding scale used. (e) Also, for those unfamiliar with NEM concepts, all times used in this article (and in the majority of articles on this site) are in “NEM time” or UTC+10 hours. Note that we were choosing to look here at the AEMO’s “TOTAL DEMAND” figure in the MMS – which is the Target for Scheduled Demand (the AEMO increasingly commonly talks about Operational Demand now, but Scheduled Demand still has its purposes and is the measure for which 21 years of history is available). Some of the gory details about measurement of demand are discussed here . Because we’d chosen to focus on Scheduled Demand (on a trading period basis) in the original article, we’ll continue to focus on it here – however this trend for the 26th October (below) shows the difference between five of the common measures of demand published by the AEMO. As discussed in Theme 6 within Part 2 of the Generator Report Card 2018, the NEM is becoming increasingly dependent on the weather : There are several aspects of the weather that might impact on how the AEMO’s forecast for Scheduled Demand might have varied so significantly from what actually resulted. Weather is not the only possible contributing factor, however – so we take a broader look below. Factor #1) The “Rate of Gross Consumption” is higher than expected In our explainer , we talked about a layperson’s idea of what “electricity demand” should actually mean, which we can call here the “Rate of Gross Consumption (from all sources)”. Focusing on this holistic measure, there are a number of reasons why “Rate of Gross Consumption (from all sources)” might have been higher – including two big ones : Factor 1A) Energy Consumption changed because of the weather Weather conditions (particularly temperature) remain a significant driver of underlying of the Rate of Gross Consumption (from all sources) . Specifically, each degree of temperature increase above (or below) a certain ‘goldilocks temperature point’ (I think it’s about 22 degrees Celsius, but some more learned reader can help me out here?) drives increased electricity consumption for space cooling (or heating). Currently we are not accessing or storing weather forecasts for use in our ‘Forecast Convergence’ framework within the ez2view software – but we are accessing real time measurements from the BOM for approximately 1,000 measurement locations across Australia – what follows is a trend specifically focused on Saturday 26th October: For those who wish to access the query to continue their own analysis: (a) Clients with access to NEMreview v7 , can find a copy of this query here ; whilst (b) Clients with access to ez2view online can find their copy of the same query here . In this trend, we can clearly see that the (hourly average) Apparent Temperature in Adelaide, Mt Gambier, Port Pirie and Whyalla rose between 10:30 (when that particular forecast for 12:30 was produced by AEMO) and 12:30 itself. However we should be very clear that: Point 1 = whilst the increase in temperature (given they were so low) may well have reduced heating demand in places across South Australia (hence reduced Rate of Gross Consumption (from all sources); Point 2 = we cannot conclude anything with respect to the difference between the 10:30 forecast and 12:30 actual… … without access to historical temperature forecasts from 10:30 on the day, we are unable to conclude the extent to which what happened with the weather was different than what the AEMO might have been assuming at 10:30. Factor 1B) Non-Scheduled Energy Consumption might have increased to take advantage of negative prices As shown in charts below, the period in question coincided with the spot price in South Australia dropping below $0/MWh. Across South Australia we have a number of clients as energy users (representing aggregate peak demand in the 100MW’s) that have various forms of spot exposure in their retail contracts (or they purchase direct from AEMO at spot prices . We know of a number of others who do something like this, but are not clients of ours. This is a form of ‘Demand Response’ in the NEM that has grown significantly over the past 10 years. Such an arrangement does open the energy user up to incentives to increase consumption when spot prices are negative . Worth re-iterating ( as discussed in some detail here ) that the Negawatt Dispatch Mechanism, as currently proposed in the AEMC’s draft rule, would not provide for this sort of price elasticity. Such an increase would probably not have been taken into consideration by the AEMO at the time they were generating the forecasts at 10:30 for the 12:30 trading period. Some of these generators also have onsite generation, which they might have curtailed in order to increase net consumption (hence payments) from the grid during these periods. Factor #2) Generation that’s not scheduled is lower than expected… One of the big differences between the “Rate of Gross Consumption” and “Scheduled Demand” is that any generation that’s not scheduled is not seen in Scheduled Demand, but is assumed to act like “negative demand” – hence meaning “Scheduled Demand” is lower than “Rate of Gross Consumption”. What complicates this further is that there are several different types of generation that are not scheduled – and (for each of these) several types of ways in which they might be producing less than expected in forecasts two hours previously. Hopefully this tables makes it clearer: Reasons why this generation might be lower than forecast Type A = Larger Generators Registered but Non-Scheduled (though still seen by AEMO) Type B = Smaller Generators Registered but Non-Scheduled (and not seen by AEMO) Type C = Very Small Generators not even registered and certainly not scheduled Reason 1 = Curtailed production due to negative prices Not shown in the two illustrations above was the fact that trading prices in South Australia through the period in question dropped into negative territory. In Scenario 1A, we have generators for whom AEMO receives SCADA data in real time curtailing production because: (i) They are spot exposed; and (ii) The price drops below zero.By virtue of the data published by AEMO for Initial MW, we explore this further below . In Scenario 1B, we have the same combination of factors – but a lack of visibility (for the AEMO or anyone else). We know this happens, as we help a number of smaller solar farms operate in precisely this way (including in the SA Region of the NEM – as discussed further below . In Scenario 1C, the generator becomes smaller still (down to residential rooftop PV). We wonder whether there are residential energy users (provided access to spot prices via offers from Amber Electric and others) who have gone to the extend of automating the curtailment of their rooftop PV systems Reason 2 = Curtailed production due to weather effects In scenario 2A, it’s clear that there might have been a loss of wind (or cloud cover depressing solar intensity) that resulted in less production from these specific generators. If this were the case, it might be visible in the InitialMW data published for the units. In scenario 2B, the reasons might have been the same – however such an impact would have been invisible. Further (to my knowledge) there is no attempt being made to understand the scale of these types of phenomenon. In scenario 2C, again cloud cover may well have had an impact on production from rooftop PV systems – to a greater degree than forecast 2 hours beforehand. Reason 3 = Curtailed production due to other reasons In scenario 3A, there may be other reasons why these larger Non-Scheduled generators might have curtailed production at these times. Let’s call this scenario 3B. Let’s call this scenario 3C. We’ll explore some of the scenarios noted in the table above in more detail below… Scenario 1A) Registered (though Visible), but Non-Scheduled generation curtails at negative prices In the growing Glossary section of the WattClarity site we’ve added this page to explain a little about generators curtailing to avoid negative prices (which is not immediately an intuitive concept – but one that is happening increasingly given the change in pricing patterns ). In the following trend we show stacked output of a number of Non-Scheduled generators (still large enough to warrant visibility to AEMO in their real time) in South Australia, and their trend of output over time: For those who wish to access the query to continue their own analysis: (a) Clients with access to NEMreview v7 , can find a copy of this query here ; whilst (b) Clients with access to ez2view online can find their copy of the same query here . The specifics of the curtailments for each of the units shown will be discussed separately here (LINK TO COME) , in order to not distract from the overall direction of this article. In aggregate we can clearly see that at least 150MW of generation supply that was there at 09:40 was absent by the time 12:30 rolled around. We note that 09:40 is earlier than the 10:30 forecast time in question, and discuss this further below. Scenario 1B) Registered, but ( Invisible and ) Non-Scheduled generation curtails at negative prices We need to remember we’re talking about the South Australian region and that (unlike the case of Queensland, where negative prices have been a bit of a shock to new entrant generators through 2019 ) generators have been exposed to negative prices in South Australia for a number of years. This longer period of experience with negative prices in South Australia has provided the lead time for a number of smaller solar farms (some still registered with AEMO and market-exposed, but invisible to them in real time) to implement automated methods to assist with curtailment of solar output when the spot prices drop below $0/MWh: (a) We are already serving some of these; (b) As noted here , there are some nuances involved in doing this properly – we have heard of a number of examples (in SA and elsewhere) of others where it has not worked so well, including because they’ve been looking at the wrong numbers (easy to do, as a ‘beginner’s mistake’); (c) I tweeted here last week about one particular case where we have helped. (d) In essence, this is the same type of approach as we’ve been taking in facilitating Demand Response at large industrial energy users for a decade or more – just in reverse. I highlight this particular scenario to highlight that (in addition to the 150MW+ of price exposed curtailment above) there would have been additional volume of supply withdrawn in South Australia on Saturday 26th October – though not visible to AEMO in real time, and certainly difficult to forecast. Scenario 2A) Registered (though Visible), but Non-Scheduled generation drops output as sun/wind fades In the stacked generation output trend chart above, we see that output from Starfish Hill Wind Farm continues through the entirety of the period of negative prices – so we conclude from this (notwithstanding this disclaimer ) that they are impervious to negative spot prices – or at least were on 26th October 2019. What does appear to happen, though, is that the output fades away through the afternoon, coincident with (though not caused by) the negative price periods. Breaking this data out into its own trend view below we can explore in further detail: You’ll note that I have also added on the wind speed (and wind gust) readings for “PARAWA (SECOND VALLEY FOREST AWS)” – which is the BOM measurement location we calculate is closest to the Starfish Hill wind farm. Eyeballing this data, it does seem that there is some correlation with reduced wind speed (and particularly wind gust) and the reduced output through the period from 10:30 to 12:30 on the day. We wonder (but again, we can’t answer, as weather forecasts are not currently in our data set) the extent to which this particular (wind lull induced) reduction in output might have appeared ‘out of the blue’ and surprised the AEMO ? We have no way of knowing this given our current data limitations (though some reader with access to data we’re missing might like to comment). Scenario 2C) Invisible Generation (Not Registered and certainly not Scheduled) drops output as sun/wind fades One of the largest (and fastest growing) types of “invisible generation” that falls into Type C generators column in the table above is rooftop PV deployed across residential and commercial rooftops across South Australia. In June 2016 I noted about the opacity of small-scale solar PV output , and will have an updated article produced shortly on that front (LINK TO COME) . There is considerable uncertainty about the contribution made by rooftop PV to netting off “Rate of Gross Consumption” down to the “Scheduled Demand Figure”. Looking firstly at estimated actuals, we include here a trend from three different estimates (two from AEMO and one from APVI) which show a wide degree of variability in estimating what the contribution actually was on Saturday 26th October: If we look just at the trace of half-hourly contribution for AEMO Method 2 (which the AEMO perhaps confusingly calls “Measurement” and says uses a “sample and extrapolation” derivation methodology) we can see that there is a drop in aggregate output suggested that occurred over the hour to 12:30 – the result of which might be inferred to mean a loss in invisible generation (and hence an necessary increase in scheduled demand) of approximately 60MW . To muddy these opaque waters further, we take a look at what the AEMO has published afterwards here for their forecast (at 10:30) of the contribution that aggregate rooftop PV would make by 12:30 on Saturday 26th October: We’ll see here that there are 4 different forecasts that the AEMO produced at 10:30 for where the aggregate contribution might be at 12:30 and that there was a fair degree of uncertainty in these forecasts (i.e. spread between them). When we couple these 4 forecast scenarios with the 2 x different AEMO “actuals” (ignoring the APVI estimate at this point given it is not an “apples to apples” comparison) we arrive at 8 different permutations for what the “discrepancy” might be over that 2-hour time gap. Hence, in truth, the best that I think we can note is that: Conclusion #1) It appears likely that there was an unforecast loss in the contribution of “invisible generation” from rooftop PV, probably due to increased cloud cover – which would have resulted in an unforecast additional amount of visible generation being required (hence increasing Scheduled Demand); and that Conclusion #2) The size of this loss/increase might have been of the order of 60MW-100MW , but we don’t really know . Scenario 3 (A), (B) or (C)) Generation that’s not scheduled disappears for other reasons There may be other reasons (other than weather, or price) why either “gross consumption” might have been higher than forecast, or non-scheduled generation lower than forecast over that period. Perhaps readers can point these out in comments below? (C) Why Forecast “Error” does not necessarily mean Forecast “Mistake” It’s worth also noting here that it’s probably more appropriate to think of this difference between the forecast and the actual as a “discrepancy” – and certainly not a “mistake”. As we have seen (above) one of the main factors contributing to the demand being higher than forecast was that there was a volume of non-scheduled generation (across various Types) that curtailed its production in response to the spot price dropping below $0/MWh. From a mathematical point of view, had AEMO assumed that this (curtailment) outcome was going to happen ahead of time in its forecast, it’s likely that the outcomes that would have eventuated might have been quite different (e.g. perhaps no negative prices, hence curtailment of generation?). When looked at this way, the discrepancy was a necessary outcome of operating the market/system as required. As noted at the end of this 1st article back on 26th October itself I noted that this event was: “an illustration of the challenges AEMO will increasingly face into the future .” Hopefully the above exploration will help to illustrate this in more detail… (D) Further down that Rabbit Hole about participant responses to negative prices… Readers might recall that we’ve published 3 Case Studies recently from a larger number of Case Studies prepared internally for a number of different reasons . Given that the variations in price-responsiveness is something that’s of keen interest to us, we’ve been working through the specific case of 26th October amongst different types of generators and will have more to present as a different style of Case Study at some future point (and will LINK BACK IN HERE when we are done). (E) Do you know of people who can help us? Once again, I would refer readers to this prior query about whether you know of people who can help us with respect to these two core capability areas? If so, please let us know (or put them in touch with us). Thanks to those who have already contacted us in this respect….",

    "title": "Summer reliability back in the headlines",
    "date": "21-11-2019 08:09:00 AM",
    "content": "The NEM is rarely in the headlines for benign reasons these days, and leading up to a long-deferred COAG Energy Council meeting on Friday, a raft of articles have (re)appeared concerning risks to supply reliability as we approach the official start of summer. We’ve covered this topic in a series of articles here on WattClarity, going back to June when we first looked at the impacts of major outages at Loy Yang A and Mortlake power stations and what these might mean for summer reliability . We then went into some depth covering AEMO’s outlook for reliability more generally, as published in the August Electricity Statement of Opportunities (ESOO). Given the renewed media interest and the early arrival in most NEM states of weather more associated with peak summer conditions, it seems like a good idea to look at what if anything has changed since those earlier assessments. ESOO Recap The ESOO identified Victoria as facing a higher probability of supply shortfalls this summer than other states, and the only region where the NEM’s formal reliability standard, based on “expected Unserved Energy (USE)”, was not forecast to be met. This was the direct result of the major Loy Yang A and Mortlake outages, and AEMO provided the following table summarising its risk assessment for Victoria under the four different scenarios where each of these units is either back in service or still being repaired over the peak summer period (formally January – March, although high temperatures and tight supply could of course appear at any time from now): I’m not going to fully decode this table here, having previously commented on what the terms really mean (and how they could have been better communicated). But the key points are that, back in August: Although owners AGL and Origin Energy had indicated that the two units being repaired were scheduled to be back online in December, AEMO judged based on past experience that the risks of significant delays were material (30% for Loy Yang A2 and 60% for Mortlake). Under each combination of outcomes for on time versus significantly delayed return for the two units, different levels of reliability risk would result, summarised in the four quadrants. It’s worth re-emphasising that the “numbers of households without power” are NOT definitive predictions of blackouts but just AEMO’s way of trying to convey the relative size of shortfalls that might occur under an adverse combination of high demands and additional generation outages. The relative probabilities of each scenario, given AEMO’s assessment of delay risks, were indicated by the red percentages in each box. AEMO’s overall (dare I say “headline”) assessment of Victorian reliability concluding that the reliability standard was not satisfied, was based on a weighted average of data from the four quadrants, using these probabilities. AEMO also a provided a very useful qualitative description of conditions under which Victorian supply shortages might emerge, based on insights from the literally hundreds of Monte-Carlo modelling runs that underlay its summary assessments. It’s worth reading if only to understand the many moving pieces in the reliability puzzle: What, if anything, has changed? We’re now three months on from the ESOO, so is there any new information on the key drivers for AEMO’s ESOO assessment – especially news on the all-important repair jobs being undertaken by AGL and Origin? Loy Yang A2 (530 MW) AGL produced a quite detailed outline of progress on this repair as part of its recent Investor Day presentation : All seems to be on schedule which is good news, but it has to be emphasised that large and complex thermal generating units returning from major long term outages don’t necessarily perform to full capability the moment they come back online. It would not be surprising if there was a period of some weeks where testing and shaking out any bugs took place. Mortlake Unit 2 (283 MW) Origin followed AGL’s lead in its own investor day presentation this Wednesday, indicating that repairs are on schedule for a late December return: Similar caveats about generators returning from long term outages obviously apply here too. Other generators Forming part of the background assumptions in the ESOO were the commissioning of AGL’s new Barker Inlet Power Station (210 MW) on South Australia. Based on AGL’s updates and on the physical generation data we can now see in AEMO’s market systems, for example the following ez2view trend chart , commissioning is underway with at least four of the twelve units having supplied power to the grid in recent weeks: On the less positive side, problems have emerged with voltage stability in the north-western Victorian network where a number of large scale solar projects have connected recently. As a result AEMO has restricted maximum output from five solar farms while it seeks a solution: The restriction on output amounts to about 160 MW at peak, although the effective contribution of solar generation to supply reliability is a complex topic since it is very dependent on the timing of demand peaks and other supply constraints. It isn’t yet clear when these restrictions will be lifted. More broadly, we can look at the trajectory of new renewable supply in Victoria over the last two years and how this has tracked over recent months: The top panel shows nominal installed capacity of large scale wind and solar in Victoria, which has increased by about 500 MW over 2019, although there has been a clear slowdown since July this year. The lower panel shows average output, which is obviously much lower than capacity, given the generation profile of solar and wind production, and dependent on seasonal and climatic conditions. Recent months show that on average , wind and solar (not including rooftop PV, which shows up as reductions in demand seen by AEMO) have added around 100 MW of supply relative to last year although on any given day and time their contribution could be much larger. AEMO’s MTPASA outlook The real headline news above is that there are now grounds for a lot more confidence than in the middle of the year – although still not 100% – that the two damaged large generation units will be back in service for the peak summer quarter, which would place the Victorian reliability outlook in lower right quadrant of AEMO’s ESOO table, if nothing else has changed. We note though that this quadrant still assessed potential USE at 0.0013% which satisfies the reliability standard threshold of 0.002% (see my “ ConfUSEd by the ESOO? ” post for a refresher on what these numbers mean) but is non-zero. AEMO is probably not going to release an updated ESOO, but its weekly operational MTPASA process produces data on the outlook for supply reliability which we can use to compare the current forecasts for available generation, potential maximum demands, and supply reliability under extreme conditions, to the same outlook at the time of the ESOO’s publication. Here are the two sets of forecasts side-by-side: I’ve previously posted on how to interpret similar ez2view trend charts of the MTPASA data and won’t go into depth here, but the bottom line is that it’s hard to pick much change at all in the two charts. This might seem surprising in view of the much higher confidence that Loy Yang A2 and Mortlake 2 will be back in service, but unlike the ESOO where AEMO considered discrete scenarios for their return dates, the MTPASA rules require AEMO to use the unit owners’ scheduled dates, which have always been for December returns to service, seen in the step ups in the dark generation capacity line. The absence of any other significant changes in the generation capacity line, demand forecasts, and supply reliability risks, indicates that any other moving pieces in the reliability puzzle, such as the outlook for renewables contribution or demand levels, have not changed significantly from the time of the ESOO. So, repair gods allowing, we are probably in the ESOO table’s lower-right quadrant world. What are market prices telling us? Like many markets, the traded market in electricity contracts acts as a kind of clearing house for information and risk assessment, as well as for financial transactions. Looking at how market prices have changed recently provides some insight into how the market views the coming summer The key lines on this chart are contract prices for Vic 2020 Q1 Base Load (bright green) and $300 Caps (orange) which reflect the market’s view on the overall level and potential volatility (above $300/MWh) of Victorian spot prices for January to March next year. These steadily increased through mid-2019, peaking in the month after the ESOO release, but have softened slightly in recent weeks, from about the date of AGL’s update on Loy Yang A2 repairs. We can also see a step down over recent weeks in average spot price levels. Current spot prices don’t imply anything specific about the reliability outlooks for Q1 next year, but are possibly part of the picture feeding into the market’s overall assessments for future price levels. So why the headlines? It’s always right to be cautious about the outlook for the NEM, which never ceases finding new ways to surprise us, but most of the objective data I’ve summarised above indicates a better outlook for summer reliability in Victoria than that at the time of the ESOO, particularly the increased confidence on Loy Yang A2 and Mortlake 2. But “better” is only a relative term and the supply-demand balance in Victoria will remain very tight under hot or extreme summer conditions until more dispatchable capacity (including firm demand side response) enters the market. I do wonder if the effect of some of those headlines – or rather the politics behind them – is actually scaring away potential providers of that capacity, who may see nothing but increased risk of further unexpected and often unhelpful political interventions. ——————————————- About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

    "title": "Let’s Talk Losses",
    "date": "19-11-2019 12:10:00 PM",
    "content": "This article was originally posted on LinkedIn, where there are other comments. This week two things happened related to rule changes on losses. The AEMC released a draft determination, rejecting the proposal to move to Average Loss Factors (ALF). They also held a working group for COGATI which proposes dynamic marginal loss factors. A little context on these conflicting proposals: ALF was proposed by investors to simplify losses and increase certainty. These are the companies solely responsible for building the new generation which is reducing our supply shortfall and wholesale prices. The same investors labelled COGATI as overly complex and uninvestable. The AEMC says they recognise that projects could not obtain long term debt as COGATI currently stands. The AEMC saw ALF as a wealth transfer from customers to generators, and said that it dampens signals to build assets in good locations. They hold dispatch efficiency and locational signals above other considerations and believe that COGATI addresses these goals. Let’s dig into the options. Background Generators in the NEM have a Marginal Loss Factor (MLF) applied to their settlements and bids in dispatch. This factor is an annual weighted average and reflects the loss from that generator to the load centre from that would occur if they increased output by 1 MW. For example an MLF of 0.95 means that only 0.95 MW would make it to customers for that generator’s last MW produced. The benefit of a marginal loss factor is that it better represents power flows in dispatch allowing for more efficient dispatch of generators, e.g. selection of a more expensive generator with low losses over a cheap generator with high losses. There are several downsides to the current approach however. An annual factor can often misrepresent a generator’s losses in real time diluting any potential efficiency benefits. Marginal losses consistently underpay generators, as the total losses divided by total generation is much lower than the sum of marginal losses. This was less of an issue when losses were consistently low. Now it is becoming a significant wealth transfer from generators to customers. Marginal loss pricing is higher than the average cost of delivery Marginal losses amplify the impact of localised changes in power flows and the present volatility in factors has cost some generators dearly. The uncertainty about loss factors, and a declining number of strong connection points is stifling investment in new generation. The Alternatives Average loss factors as proposed by the first rule change use the total losses divided by total generation. This results in a lower loss figure compared with marginal losses (approximately half). This option allows for fairer payment to generators for the actual volume of their product that was consumed by customers. The impact on price is to lower it as generator bids are divided by a higher factor. This option still doesn’t solve the dispatch efficiency issue that annual loss factors introduce. The absolute error is reduced though, and the reduced risk to generators is conducive to more investment which also lowers price. Dynamic marginal loss factors as proposed by the AEMC would have a new factor for each generator for each 5 minute interval. In COGATI this is combined with a separate price for each connection point that effectively amplifies locational risk. Dynamic factors solve the efficiency problem that annual factors have, and allows AEMO to dispatch most efficiently. It’s worth noting that this doesn’t mean lower prices, just more accurate selection of who’s cheapest at the margin. Often nothing will seem different to now with large price setting generators who’ve got stable loss factors setting the price within cents of what they are doing now. The main disadvantage of dynamic losses is the increase in volatility. Investors will have even less certainty over what they will be paid over decades when their loss factor changes every 5 minutes. Price too should become more volatile as generators at the margin swing in and out of profitability based on power flows elsewhere in the network. Rebidding for “change in loss factor” will become commonplace. Again it’s worth noting that these are marginal losses so in settlements generators will continue to be paid for less than what the customer consumed. Dispatch Efficiency This is supposed to be the main benefit of MLFs, especially dynamic ones. I suppose in economic theory this is true, but in the real world the benefits are demonstrably minuscule. This is because price is not distributed on a smooth curve like in theory. Bids are stepped and non-contiguous. Generators don’t necessarily bid their short run cost either. This means for almost all intervals there is no difference in dispatch outcomes and marginal generation for any loss factor methodology. For the intervals where we can detect a change in marginal price setter the price is likely to be very similar – two similar bids with two similar loss factors means a negligible change in price. I would expect very little difference in dispatch whether we use dynamic, ALF/MLF or simply a fixed value for everyone as fuel cost is 97% of the marginal price. As we move to higher renewable penetrations and more frequent periods of $0 bids setting price the accuracy benefit of whichever loss factor methodology we choose becomes even less relevant. Locational Signals This is a big part of both the AEMC’s rejection of ALF and their pitch for dynamic factors. The thinking goes that accurate loss factor representation provides a signal about where to build new generators. Unfortunately dispatch outcomes provide no leading indicator for investors. The potential increase in losses for a new generator is not at all obvious just by observing historical loss factors. Broken Hill solar farm is a great example: upon construction they had an MLF well above 1.0 (their generation reduced flows from the east and associated losses), after other generators connected nearby their loss factor fell spectacularly ~50 percentage points over 2 years as the reverse flow on the line was now creating losses as it travelled east. Their spot revenue fell about 40% in that time purely because of loss factors. If you had invested after seeing their first year’s MLF you would have merely added to the problem that had not yet emerged. The sensitivity of MLF to changing flows means investors are at greater risk that their revenue drops by 10 or 20% because of the decisions of other generators. For a heavily geared and contracted generator a swing like this takes them from a healthy return into loss making territory. The current locational signals we are providing are simply saying “do not invest in the NEM, unless it’s right next to a capital city” The only thing that helps here is power flow modelling. The COGATI proposal reduces certainty in modelling outcomes because it converts volume risk into price risk. It seeks to overcome this by offering unfirm, short term hedges open to purchase by entities other than the generator that needs them. Thinking outside the NEM numbers game for a moment – where should we put generators? Surely building wind and solar where the resource is strong, where land is cheap, and where it benefits the community the strongest is the best option. Developers today are only looking at loss factors which means higher project costs and less new generation. Certainty Hazelwood closed 3 years ago and in 3 years Liddell will close. We haven’t built enough new generators and prices remain high; they’ll go higher again in NSW. Uncertainty is at an all time high and the economists want to make things worse to make them better. So what’s the benefit of certainty? Debt is cheap right now. This is great for electricity consumers because newly financed generators (particularly capital intensive ones like wind/solar) can offer very cheap prices. In a negligible interest rate world the risk premium on debt and equity is a major component of energy costs. I argue this is a strong incentive to socialise transmission risk as generators cannot manage this risk themselves and conservative assumptions will drive up costs. However we don’t have adequate measures for transmission augmentation to ameliorate these risks. If it’s no-one’s responsibility the risk falls to the consumer one way or the other. I’ve segued – back to losses. Can Everyone Have What They Want? The AEMC have really only considered locational pricing and dynamic loss factors, but there’s a spectrum of options. Whatever we choose will be a compromise though. Generators want to have settlement based on average losses, and they want these losses to be stable over a long time. They want irrational investors not to arrive after they build. Economists want efficient dispatch of generation, based on dynamic marginal losses. They want generators to have signals to invest in the most rational locations. They should also want no wealth transfers. Here’s my compromised solution: Dispatch is run based on dynamic marginal losses to allow AEMO to select the most efficient combination of generation with respect to power flows. The marginal bid price is divided by the dynamic average loss factor of the marginal unit resulting in a lower dispatch price compared to using MLF. Settlement is based on dynamic average losses or (1-(1-MLF)/2) E.g. the marginal unit has a SRMC and bid price of $50. Their dynamic loss factor is 0.95. The spot price for the interval will be $50 / (1-(1-0.95)/2) or $51.28. The marginal unit will be paid based on their MW * (1-(1-0.95)/2) or 0.975*MW. Multiplying price and production gets us to MW*50. For a cheaper generator with a dynamic marginal loss factor of 0.8 the results are: Revenue = $51.28 * MW * (1-(1-0.8)/2) = $46.15*MW OK, so we’ve erased the wealth transfer and got more efficient dispatch. What about stability and signals not to invest? In terms of stability the absolute range of average losses is smaller which limits generator risk. The AEMC ask whether this just drives the generation equilibrium to more generation in congested areas and a higher average loss. There is a floor on MLF/ALF though; at some point the line will be running at rated capacity and any further generation addition simply results in curtailment. This floor appears to be at about 15% average losses. Again, the locational signal is only revealed though flow modelling. We can hope all investors are now doing proper curtailment studies, but it would be good to have a more explicit way to discourage construction in congested areas. We still have no coordination between transmission and generation investment, but none of the access options do this. Let’s solve that with another mechanism and at least put loss factors to bed. Ideally the investment tests for transmission would fully value the benefits but that’s another topic altogether.

    "content": "In an earlier article for WattClarity, I explored how retailers hedge, so I thought I would examine the flipside of this, in how generators usually hedge. Firstly, it is important to realise that what I present here is representative of usual practice, but this does not preclude a generator from taking alternative means of hedging, or no hedging at all. It is also important to understand that the National Electricity Market (NEM) is an energy only market, which encourages consumers of energy to contract to minimise the risk of exposure to high spot market prices and conversely, encourages generators to contract to minimise the risk of extended periods of low spot prices. Market Design The NEM is a “gross-pool,” “energy only” market, which means the following: All generation must be bid into the market. All generation and consumption must be settled through the market. Market participants only pay or receive revenue for when they consume or generate energy. Generators do not receive any direct capacity payments from the energy market. A key observation of the NEM and similar energy markets like New Zealand is that much of the time when the there is more than sufficient generation to supply the market, prices are usually set at “marginal cost”, which is effectively the cost of fuel for a generator. Generating at marginal cost for a generator is insufficient in the medium to longer term to also cover the fixed costs of a generator such as capital costs, salary costs etc. (arguably, in the long run no costs are fixed but in the timeframe we are considering, these costs cannot be deferred). Conversely, at times of high demand, when generator reserve margins are low or non-existent, spot prices soar to prices that may be an order of magnitude or more above generators’ marginal cost. The end result of the “gross-pool”, “energy only” market is that both energy retailers and generators face significant risk if they only sell or purchase energy at the spot price. i.e. a retailer that sells energy at a fixed price to its customers may “ make hay whilst the suns shines ” if it pays the spot price when the market is oversupplied but faces the potential risk of huge losses if prices spike at times of high demand, whilst a generator faces the risk of receiving little or no revenue when spot prices are subdued, which may persist for an extended period of time. Therefore, generators as well as retailers are motivated to provide revenue or cost certainty by contracting. There are a number of derivatives or financial contracts that can be utilised but the main contracts utilised are swaps and caps. Briefly retouching on these contracts again, as I have done previously for WattClarity. Swap Contracts Swap contracts are those that provide price certainty to both buyer and seller, where the buyer is paid by the seller the difference between the spot price and the contract price, when the spot price is higher than the contract price. Conversely, when the spot price is below the contract price, the buyer pays to the seller, the difference between the spot price and the contract price. Effectively, buyer and seller “swap” insurances, i.e. the buyer insures the seller against relatively frequent low prices, and the seller insures the buyer against infrequent but potentially very high prices. Cap Contracts A cap contract is essentially just one half of the swap contract, which insures the buyer against prices above the contract or strike price and the seller receives compensation known as premium for providing this insurance. Usually in Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM), these contracts have a strike price of $300/MWh. If these concepts need further clarification, I suggest you review the two following articles on WattClarity: “ How Retailers use contracts to hedge customers ” by yours truly; or “ More on those negative prices, how do contracts affect bidding ” by Allan O’Neill “Baseload” Generation Historically, “baseload” generation has mainly been largely coal-fired generation that had the following attributes: High Capital Cost Low Fuel Cost Slow to start/shutdown and change output MW (relatively inflexible) As a “baseload” generator wishes to cover both its fixed and variable costs, and is best suited to running 24/7 operation, a contract that supports a flat load and is sufficient to cover both fixed and variable costs is likely to be a swap. If we consider a hypothetical scenario, with a baseload generator that has $30/MWh of fixed costs and a marginal cost of generation of $20/MWh, mainly representing the cost of fuel (coal), then a swap at $50/MWh is sufficient. Figure 1 – Baseload generator running almost all year What this means for a baseload generator is that if the swap price is near your Long-term Cost of Energy (LCOE) then selling swap contracts at close to your rated capacity is a sensible strategy to earn a reliable revenue. As stated in my previous article, a baseload generator (subject to minimum generation levels and flexibility) may choose to alter its output to higher levels when the spot price is above the marginal cost of generation, or conversely reduce output when the spot price is below the marginal cost of generation, both to improve profitability. Peaking Generation Peaking Generators usually have the following attributes: Lower Capital Cost Higher Fuel cost than “base load” Relatively fast to start May be fuel constrained Traditionally, this may have been Open Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGT) or even diesel generators. Hydro generators are also often peaking generators but although their build costs are high, their investment horizon and useful life is much longer, so the capital costs per year may also in effect be lower. Therefore, a contract that pays their fixed annual costs and covers their fuel costs when operating is ideal for a peaking generator. A hypothetical example might be as follows. It must be noted that fixed costs should be covered all year, whilst fuel costs only need to be covered when the generator is running, which may typically be 10-20% of the time in the NEM. Therefore, we effectively have two states of operation: Running at or around full load: Figure 2 – Theoretical Peaking Generator costs when running When the generator is off: Figure 3 -Theoretical Peaking generator costs when generator is off, where fixed MWh is annual cost/total MWh for 24h-365-day operation Note: most gas fired peakers have best efficiency at maximum output, so if running, they will usually wish to be at full load to maximise spot market profits Therefore, if the generator could sell a cap with a premium of $20/MWh and a strike price of $300/MWh under this scenario, it covers its fixed costs and only has to pay out when prices are above $300/MWh. Additionally, as its marginal cost of generation is only $100/MWh, it makes additional profit when the price exceeds $100/MWh. This particularly suits gas fired peakers that pay spot prices for gas, rather than contracting fixed price contracts as they don’t know which days they will be expected to run. These generators can potentially cover their fixed costs and generate only when prices are sufficiently high. Whilst they potentially may give up some profits, they have certainty over a large portion of their revenue by contracting a cap contract. Mid-merit (Intermediate) Plant Intermediate plant may have previously been described as “mid-merit” because it is not as cheap as a baseload power station, nor as expensive as a peaker. This was usually because Closed Cycle Gas Turbines would supply this part of the market and consume natural gas with greater efficiency than a peaker as they capture some of the waste heat from the gas turbine and normally use this to power a steam turbine. This plant is usually more flexible than a baseload generator but not as flexible as a peaker. This type of generator may only contract for a few months at a time, or alternatively it may only sell peak swap contracts that operate from 7am to 10pm on working weekdays. Variable or Intermittent Plant Renewable generation is often labelled as variable or intermittent as its generation at any future point in time is uncertain as it relies on the availability of solar or wind resources. Most owners of these plants prefer to contract a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), which is actually a swap contract with a fixed price but with variable volume. We could assume that a wind farm might have maintenance cost per MWh for the wear and tear on turbines when used, but a solar farm might well be considered as a capital investment where the annual operating costs are also considered to be fixed as they occur regardless of the generation output i.e. staff, cutting the grass, cleaning panels etc. In this instance, we may consider the variable costs to be zero, so the revenue needed per MWh that is required is simply enough to cover the investment, interest costs and earn an economic profit. If we assume that an adequate price is $50/MWh, then our revenue requirements can be displayed as in figure 4. Figure 4 – Renewable Generator Revenue requirements Generation Business Contracting Policies Generation companies will usually have a risk management policy that stipulates rules that may include: Types of contracts that may be utilised i.e. swaps, caps, futures etc. Counterparties that can be traded with Levels of contracts and the times at which contracts can be entered into against generation assets. This may be affected by the number of generation units, dam levels, contracted fuel supply, maintenance and other factors. As a potential example, a baseload generation business might only be able to trade swaps, with counterparties of reasonable credit quality and may only be able to contract the full output of 3 of its 4 generators* subject to sufficient coal contracts. *n-1 contracting : it is often suggested that a “safe” contracting level for a generation company is to contract all of its units, except output equal to its largest contracted generating unit to cover the possibility of an unplanned outage. Whilst this is plausible, often there may only be 1 or 2 units, so often short-term contracts such as caps may be purchased by baseload generators to manage maintenance downtime whilst some peakers such as gas turbines can manage to do short duration maintenance in shoulder periods when energy market demand is low. Within the constraints of the risk management policy, it would be expected that the organisation gives its trading team some latitude in the level and timing of the contracting. i.e. a policy might stipulate something like the following in table 1, where the final contract level is decided based upon their view of the of expected spot prices versus market contract prices. Hedging Level Current Period 3 to 12 months 1-2 years 2-3 years Minimum 60 % 50 % 40% 20% Maximum 100% 100 % 70% 60% Table 1 – Potential hedging limits Further Contracting Choices It should be noted that the hedging arrangements here are representative and you could reasonably expect that many generation companies would hedge in this manner. Conversely, it is also possible that a baseload generator might be selling caps or even a peaking generator could be selling swaps, provided that it is sanctioned by the risk management policy and the business believed it represented a more attractive commercial proposition at a point in time. Generators may also purchase hedges when prices are low in anticipation of future price rises or to reduce their contracted position to realise a profit or manage expected outages. There are other contracts, particularly options over swaps or caps that may be employed and we’re not going to describe all contracting opportunities available in this article. As an example, a frequently traded contract is often be a “swaption” which is either of an option to buy or to sell a swap contract at an agreed price. i.e. if you’re a generator wanting to take advantage of future high market prices say 1 to 2 years out but are uncertain if your maintenance will be finished at that time you could buy a put option that enables you to sell a swap contract at an agreed price anytime from now until the final exercise date. Your premium is paid to the seller and the swap is only invoked if you exercise the option. This effectively buys you an insurance against the risk of wholesale prices falling, whilst not committing your generation. Concluding remarks Most generators hedge much of their capacity and this varies from business to business. Many of these contracts entered into are swaps or caps but other contracting choices are available. It should also be observed that whilst a baseload generator would like to cover its LCOE with swaps and that a peaking generator would ideally like to have the cap premium pay its fixed costs, the market prices available reflect the relative scarcity of these financial products and are not guaranteed to be sufficient in the long term. At times during the history of the NEM, contract prices may have been viewed as insufficient for an economic return on generation and this may have been caused by a number of factors including initial over investment in capacity and non-market arrangements such as vesting contracts put in place by state governments in the transition to competitive markets. I hope this article assists in understanding some of the contracting of generators in the NEM. ——————————————- About our Guest Author Warwick Forster is an experienced energy professional with 20 years of experience covering energy trading, risk management, market operations, retailing, pricing, renewable project development and energy storage.

    "title": "Probability, Consequence (and Risk) as it relates to summer 2019-20 in the NEM",
    "date": "18-11-2019 09:14:00 AM",
    "content": "… and so with this refresher to probability, consequence, and risk behind us, let us continue on with today’s brief two-part article, let’s take a look at concerns for the fast-approaching summer 2019-20. —- Following Allan’s earlier casino analogy , three days later (on Monday 26th August) guest author Allan O’Neil continued with this excellent unpacking of what was noted in AEMO’s 2019 publication of the ESOO on Monday 26th August. The 2019 Electricity Statement of Opportunities itself is here , for ease of reference. We’re three months closer to summer, now – and we’ve noticed an uptick in news media coverage* of looming risks over summer like this one “Precarious power grid faces serious risks, warns Energy Minister Angus Taylor” on 4th November by Perry Williams in the Australian and the article “Victoria manufacturers prepare for power crunch” by Angela and Mark in the AFR yesterday . * unfortunately this news media coverage is stoked by people playing partisan politics – which seems par for the course these days, but which probably makes it more difficult for an objective observer to truly understand the real risk we’re facing. This lead-in line from the weekend’s AFR article seems to sum up the concern: “Manufacturers are drawing up contingency plans to shift operations out of Victoria this summer as fears of blackouts and sky-high electricity prices for the March quarter keep nerves on edge.” It’s worthwhile to revisit the three separate concepts to understand how each applies in terms of the risk of supply/demand balance being stretched. B1) Probability of a particular unit outage Remembering that probability is the chance of a particular event happening, let’s talk about this in terms of electricity supply sector concepts: B1a) Availability of a unit Availability is a volumetric measure (i.e. focused on MWh available to dispatch into the market, as distinct from instantaneous MW rate) that might be expressed in MWh or as a % of a total hypothetical volume over some time. range How it’s calculated is different for Scheduled, Semi-Scheduled and Non-Scheduled units: (i) For Scheduled units it’s relatively easy matter of calculating based on the availability in the bid for the unit – for each dispatch interval – and then aggregated over the time-range of interest. (ii) For Semi-Scheduled units, it’s a little more complex – because the bidding process is different for these projects: 1. The availability estimate in ASEFS or AWEFS (or the self-forecast) overwrites the “Max Avail” in the bid to define what NEMDE actually sees as the capability of the unit. 2. Hence this must be used to cap the volume in each bid band to define the true bid structure for the unit for a dispatch interval – and then aggregate over time as above. (iii) For Non-Scheduled units it is impossible to calculate availability, as all we can see is the output of the unit (assuming this is even provided in “Initial MW”). Historically that’s not been an issue – but will it start becoming an issue in future? In this article on 14th June I unpicked some of the work that we had done in the Generator Report Card 2018 to trend the aggregate level of unavailability across the remaining 48 coal-fired units in the NEM . In this case, we calculated unavailability as: Unavailability = Theoretical Perfect Availability (based on Registered* Capacity) – Actual Availability (in the coal generator bids) * in this case we used Registered Capacity to set the upper bound because of how that relates to a most coal plant’s “normal” operating range (i.e. below overload). What’s particularly interesting is that unbundling this unavailability into sub-categories of “full” and “partial” show that: (i) Aggregated across all 48 coal units, full unavailability in has largely remained the same over the 10 years to 31st December 2018 (see chart copied further below); whereas (ii) There has been a consistent trend up of partial unavailability – again aggregated across all 48 x operational coal units, as shown in the prior article, and copied in here for convenience: With respect to concerns about Victoria and the coming summer, it’s worth remembering that Victoria (now, after Hazelwood closure) has 10 x operational coal units – so only 10 out of the 48 units used in total for the aggregations in the Generator Report Card. Readers might like to keep that in mind in contemplating the specific implications for Victoria. Unit level data for all 10 of these Victorian coal units (along with the other 320 units across the NEM that have operated in recent times) were individually detailed in the Generator Report Card 2018 , with updated (and extended) statistics to be prepared for our Generator Statistical Digest 2019 for release in January 2020. B1b) Forced outage rate for a unit Whilst availability is a measure of the probability of a MWh of energy being available at any given time over a period, there’s also a concern about the risk of a generator being unavailable at a critical time – and, more specifically, tripping at a critical time. This requires different metrics than blanket availability, with some of what we did under a ‘Sudden Failure’ category in the Generator Report Card discussed here . Statistically speaking, the volume of energy capability that a generator might typically lose from ‘forced’ outages would typically be significantly lower than the volume of energy capability lost from ‘planned’ outages (i.e. the probability is lower). However the consequence of such events might be significantly higher, as they could occur unexpectedly, and at inopportune times. In Allan article ‘ESOO Unboxing’ from 26th August 2019 he notes that the diagram in the ESOO that best summarises Full Forced Outage Rates was this one: Allan noted that two key observations from this data that resonated with him were: (i) brown coal plant forced outage rates had risen over the past four years with the last two years being particularly poor ; and (ii) while there’s no obvious time trend over recent years, there’s a very big discrepancy between black coal plant forced outage rates on different sides of the NSW-Queensland border. Currently calculating forced outage rates is something that’s not at all easy for anyone to do, other than AEMO (we did have a go, in the Generator Report Card), because some of the data required to do this properly is currently deemed confidential for all time. (i) Being forced to rely on just a single organisation (any organisation!) for detailed analysis of raw data is not an ideal solution – especially one that is so complex, and also so fundamental to modelled results such as in the ESOO. (ii) That’s one reason why we’re particularly keen for this rule change proposed by ERM Power to be accepted by the AEMC . B1c) … but no, higher ambient temperatures do not increase the probability of a particular coal unit outage Whilst focusing on the overlapping topics of probability, summer and coal, it is worth stating directly that none of the data we pored through as in the process of preparing the Generator Report Card 2018 suggests that the probability of a coal unit outage is higher in summer (in fact, the you can see here that the monthly full unavailability is typically lower during the hotter months – which makes sense, as that’s obviously when the market needs it most): Yes, high ambient temperatures do have an effect on limiting the maximum output capability of coal units, though: (i) The effect is different for different units; and (ii) The effect is probably far less than you might have been led to believe had you been reading less numerically-based commentary elsewhere. (iii) This is one of the reasons for the shape in the partial unavailability trend in the 1st chart above. In the Generator Report Card 2018 , we investigate temperature effects on peak output across all types of generation assets and include some results that might surprise some readers (including how some wind farms demonstrate output capability limitations at high temperatures – some quite pronounced). For our Generator Statistical Digest 2019 we are scoping out how we can extend this analysis into more depth for every single DUID for results shown through CAL 2019, as this type of objective data is going to be much more important into the future. B2) Consequence , if that same event does happen Now with concerns for heightened level of risk in the Victorian region for this coming summer period (quite understandable concerns) I can understand a sense of cognitive dissonance emanating from those for whom the data above is a revelation. They might be saying: How can it be that the coal units are typically more available during summer, and no more likely to trip due to heat – and yet we face increased risk ? This is where I would point again to our reminder about the two key aspects of risk and note that we have not spoken about Consequence – which is (I believe) the forgotten part of the equation, and where the answer to our rhetorical question lies. Up until the closure of Hazelwood, the Victorian region had 18 coal units at its disposal – now it only has 10. Assuming all else is equal* then hopefully readers can understand that the consequence of any given unit being unavailable is so much greater , as there are many fewer units to draw upon should that unit be unavailable, for whatever reason. * note that it’s not strictly true that “all else is equal” as there have been a number of overlapping developments in the Victorian region since that time – but it’s not a bad simplifying assumption to start with Returning to our clapped out 2nd car analogy , Victorians have (for years) received the benefits of having that second car in the garage, in the form of Hazelwood. Might have been very old, and a bit of a pain to run (and very bad for emissions!), but it was there as a back-up if the first car was at the mechanics for some reason. These days (post Hazelwood, and with almost NIL new dispatchable capacity built as replacement in VIC ) it’s a more white-knuckle ride on the Victorian roads these days, with no back-up car ( maybe no spare tyres, either ) to call on should our primary workhorse have to be in the workshop for any reason. B3) So let’s focus on solving the ‘real’ problems It’s because of heightened consequence , not (primarily*) because of heightened probability , that we’re sweating so much on concerns about whether Loy Yang A3 will be back in time, and the same for Mortlake Unit 2 ! * though the concerns about increased forced outage rates on the dwindling number of thermal “workhorse” units is one that should be taken seriously – and I look forward to the AEMC approving ERM Power’s rule change request ( draft determination published on 24th Oct with comments due 9th Jan 2020 and expected completion 20th Feb 2020 ) so we can all understand more clearly how significantly this is changing. I well understand that there are a number of valid reasons why a growing number of people dislike generation from coal-fired power (primarily related to carbon emissions, but also particulates and so on), but this does not mean that they should be misrepresenting what the data is actually saying, in terms of risks to reliability for the coming summer period and into the future. As noted in our Generator Report Card 2018 , the current coal-fired fleet will close in the years ahead – and it would seem crazy to build replacement dispatchable capacity using coal as a fuel ( doubly crazy to build anything large in northern Queensland given local issues there , and the fact that it’s Victoria – and then NSW – which will be screaming out for new capacity). However, if we start with an incorrect understanding of what the actual problem is, then it’s a very low chance we’ll ever come up with a solution that actually works? That’s surely not what we had in mind in writing that our “transitional challenges require greatly enhanced analytical capability” under Theme 2 in Part 3 of our Generator Report Card 2018 : We need to do better than that – and it would be a great start to remember the difference between probability and consequenc e (and how both relate to risk, as summer washes over us). B4) Stay tuned for updates as summer progresses… Guest author, Allan O’Neil , will be back through summer 2019-20 to add in some detailed analysis and commentary should the supply/demand balance become too overheated. Whilst many readers have noted that Allan does a wonderful job of explaining complex events (thanks!), I’d also believe that many of us are hoping that Allan does not find much to write about this time ! However we need to be realistic that (even just because of heightened consequence, if a dispatchable unit should be offline unexpectedly) the level of risk this summer is heightened, especially for Victoria.",

    "date": "18-11-2019 09:00:00 AM",
    "content": "The Level of Risk in the NEM is increasing . That’s what we highlighted under Theme 2 in Part 3 of our Generator Report Card 2018 : Not only is the level of risk been increasing – we have also seen the volume of chatter about risk also increasing (one particular bout in the mainstream media prompted this article on 9th August 2019 )…. (A) Confusion about Components … however as that volume of chatter increases, it also highlights that there’s some considerable confusion amongst the broader group of energy sector stakeholders about two distinctly different components of risk – probability, and consequence. Back on Friday 23rd August, guest author Allan O’Neil used a simple gambling analogy to help explain the confusing mass of acronyms and technical concepts that plague important documents like the Electricity Statement of Opportunities. Let’s continue with a “rolling the dice” gambling analogy to explain the difference between the different components: Probability … of something happening Consequence … of something happening if it does If we’re rolling the dice in the casino, then the probability of the dice turning up with a SIX is 16.7% (a) in layperson terms, that’s the “chance” of something occurring; (b) which is just calculated as 1/6 (i.e. 1 state we want, out of 6 possible (and equally likely) states in total). Let’s say that our dice does indeed turn up on a SIX and our payout was a tidy $60 from the small $10 bet we placed at this Casino at the simplistic* odds they gave us. * this casino operator’s probably not going to be in business very long . That’s a handy, though not enormous consequence . On the flip-side, the worst we could do would be lose our $10 wagered. Some of us would probably be willing to take this bet – because: 1) firstly , the downside consequence (i.e. loss of $10) is low; but 2) also because the probability of success was sufficiently high (with respect to the expected payout) to justify the risk In this sense, our level of risk (i.e. combining consequence and probability) was acceptable, we were happy to take a seat at the table … … now let’s say that there was an altercation inside of this casino and we were dragged out onto a street resembling the Wild West, and our dice was swapped with a six shooter with one loaded chamber. We’re now being asked to play Russian Roulette – where the odds (i.e. the probability ) remain the same …. It should be pretty obvious that the consequences of “our number coming up” are so much more dire in this scenario – not because the odds have changed, but because the consequences have significantly escalated . In this example, then, we should be able to clearly see how our level of risk has significantly increased – not because the probability has changed, but because the consequence has become so much more significant. Let’s leave the Wild West now and journey back into the NEM (though some might say there are similarities, I know), because we’re faced with increased risk in a number of different ways here. Hopefully we can now understand, a little better, what this actually means. (B) Let’s look at summer 2019-20 fast approaching With this background in mind, let’s move onto the second part of this two-part article and look at what’s looming for summer 2019-20 …",

    "title": "First look at South Australia islanded on Saturday evening, 16th Nov 2019",
    "date": "17-11-2019 03:29:00 PM",
    "content": "Yesterday evening (Saturday 16th November) the Heywood interconnector tripped, islanding the South Australian region from the eastern regions of the NEM. I was supposed to be doing something else today, but did field a few questions externally which (stoked by natural curiosity) has distracted me for a bit! However we do have these two big reasons for allowing ourselves to be ‘distracted’ by events like these . Hence I hope you’ll find this initial review of some value – and, of course, please do let us know what I have missed, or misunderstood? (A) Automated responses triggered for 18:20 Here’s some of the dispatch outcomes published (at 18:15:20 for) the 18:20 dispatch interval seen via a snapshot from ez2view time-travelled back to this first dispatch interval immediately following the trip: (Click on the image for a larger view) This is the first dispatch interval where AEMO’s dispatch target flow for Heywood shows the result of the islanding. This suggests that the islanding occurred sometime between 18:10 and 18:15 (NEM time) . Given that this is the first visibility to participants, it’s too early for market participants to have learnt of the islanding, to decide how they should respond, and adjust their bids (if Scheduled or Semi-Scheduled) to take advantage. What we can see happening are automated responses triggered as a result of the NEMDE run in the absence of any market participant response. (A1) Auto-bidding at two batteries The “$” symbols on the schematic signify that (from 18:15 to 18:20) there was some change in bid at Hornsdale Power Reserve (Generator and Load components) and also at Dalrymple North BESS (Load Component). We won’t go into the details – the main point is that these are independent of the trip. Note that Lake Bonney is the 3rd battery in South Australia at present – however it does not feature during this particular event. (A2) Three sets of DUIDs being Constrained Up/Down We see that four different constraints are bound affecting the output of four sets of generators – with two of these sets annotated on the image above: (A2a) Lake Bonney 2 and Lake Bonney 3 (collectively) ‘constrained down’ In the ‘Unit Dashboard’ Widget for the Lake Bonney 2 unit, we see that the constraint equation binding on Lake Bonney 2 really, really* wants to wind down the unit quickly to 0MW : * We can see this in the Connection Point Dispatch price of –$5,291,922.50/MWh (yep, that far south!), which is obviously a long, long way under where they had offered their volume (in the bid range below $0/MWh but above –$100/MWh, which might be thought of as a ‘negative LGC’ bid notwithstanding this caveat ). However despite this strong desire for a fast ramp from the constraint equation, we see the ramp down limited to only 15MW because of the ROCDOWN rate bid in for the unit of 3MW/min. Out of curiosity we drill into the constraint ID “SA_ISLE_STRENGTH_LB” referenced here to see more: Note that the constraint equation has already violated, because this constraint equation is saying that it would (in the absence of anything else) wind down the sum of the outputs to –26.79MW whereas the sum of the outputs We noted that AEMO’s Description of the constraint suggests it also wants to wind down Canunda WF, but this is not possible in this dispatch interval as the unit is Non-Scheduled (just like Lake Bonney 1 WF). At some point in the past the unit was Scheduled, I believe, but this Description has not been updated when the registration status changed? It’s a similar story at Lake Bonney 3, where the station was able to be would down to 0MW because of its low starting point. (A2b) Snowtown 2 North and Snowtown 2 South (collectively) ‘constrained down’ Here’s the Unit Dashboard widget specifically focused on SNOWNTH1 unit: Similarly we look at the “F_S+SNS_TG_R6_1” constraint equation which is impacting on both North and South: We see that the constraint is trying to keep 1.3928 times the sum of the outputs across two units (minus the Local Requirement for Raise Six-Second Contingency FCAS in SA) to be no more than 41.37MW, and in this dispatch interval there is an exact match (the constraint is bound, and has a non-zero marginal value). Hence this constraint will cap the output of these 2 units, and even wind them down further if the local enablement of (A2c) Osborne and Torrens B3 (separately) ‘constrained down’ I did not have space to annotate this on the image above, but we can see the effect of the binding in the “-“ symbol replacing the normal unit filled circle for both units in the Adelaide zone. Here’s the Unit Dashboard widget for Torrens B3, for a start: The display (above) for Torrens B3 is more complicated than those displays for the 2 wind farms above for several reasons (including the enablement for both Raise Regulation and Lower Regulation FCAS services coincident with their dispatch target). There are calculations running behind the scenes to derive some of the numbers shown but not all of these are transparent at this point. However the constraint equation that’s binding on TORRB3 is of a very similar form to that we explored for Snowtown 2 (North and South) above: It is also having the effect of setting a limit on the output of TORRB3 , subject to the RHS and the Raise 6second Local Requirement/Enablement in the islanded SA Region. Finally, I have included the snapshot for Osborne CCGT plant here with no comment other than to note that this is being affected by four separate constraint equations , all FCAS (Raise) related: (A3) Forecast Dispatch Prices (for ENERGY) jump in the South Australian region. As noted in the first image, we see that the P5 forecast prices for energy showed a forecast jump from the actual dispatch price for energy at 18:20. Delving deeper as enabled by the ‘Forecast Convergence’ Widget in ez2view, we see that this jump in price had been (somewhat) signalled over the prior 40 minutes or so – so perhaps was not wholly as a result of the interconnector coming offline? i.e. look up a vertical to see how successive forecasts converged onto “actual” values in the top diagonal. Out of curiosity, I flip the widget to show the Target Flow for the Heywood interconnector (and prior successive forecast for Target Flow) and we see that the flow east had dropped (from 18:10 to 18:15) but that the drop to 0MW was not forecast: (A4) Prices for FCAS Finally for 18:20 we know this cursory initial review would not be complete if we did not also have a look at FCAS prices – there are enough clues in the constraint equations above that it would be remiss of us not to have a quick look: For a change I have used the ‘Swim Lanes’ Widget in ez2view with a view specifically focused on SA Region Data and the Interconnectors. To help those who are unfamiliar with this widget, I have highlighted the 18:20 dispatch interval, and in particular also some elevated prices for various FCAS services – with P5 predispatch forecasts suggesting this would continue (or get worse) into the near future. (B) No manual Participant Responses at 18:25 Remembering that this was a Saturday evening, and that participants would have only had (approx) 3 minutes to digest all of the information available at the time and work out what to do, so it is hardly a surprise that there were no manual responses from participants taken account of at the AEMO in the NEMDE run published at 18:20:20 for 18:25 What was done at the two batteries (Hornsdale Power Reserve and Dalrymple BESS) was limited to what automated logic is able to manage. (C) One new Participant Response at 18:30 (Snowtown 1 WF) Stepping forward to 18:30 (a new title bar colour because of all the other windows still open) we see that there is a rebid response from the (older) Snowtown 1 WF (the first, apart from those at the 2 batteries): Using the Bid Comparison function (for this bid prior to the prior one) we see the logic has shifted volume from the –$1,000/MWh bid band up to $5,000/MWh (but note this only takes effect in the next dispatch interval (ending 18:35), so has no effect on the outcomes for this particular dispatch ): We do also flag that the dispatch price (for energy) has reversed the prior drop below $0/MWh. (D) At 18:35 – many responses, and more information Five minutes later (and into the first dispatch interval of the new 19:00 trading period) we can see that there are many responses now received by the AEMO for use in the NEMDE dispatch run for 18:35 (new targets published at 18:30:20). (D1) A quick review of the responses We see in the image above (i.e. the ‘$’ symbols) for 18:35 that there are new changes in bids (i.e. from 18:30 dispatch interval to 18:35 dispatch interval) for the first time in this short review from Mintaro, Torrens, Pelican Point, Pt Stanvac, Lonsdale and Ladbroke Grove. These changes could take a variety of different forms, so we open up the ‘Bids & Offers’ widget in order to have a quick look at both: 1) the changes that took effect between 18:30 and 18:35; along with 2) rebid reasons given. As annotated on the image, it appears that the main mover was both Port Stanvac and Lonsdale peakers (both in the Snowy portfolio), who shifted volume down from above $300/MWh to $0/MWh in order to gain a dispatch target and begin operations. As a result of this move, we see that these units were identified by the AEMO as being the primary contributors for setting the price for Energy in this dispatch interval. We won’t dwell on the details here, but worth noting that these bids for Energy also had an impact on the price for several FCAS commodities at the same time ( Raise6, Lower5 and LowerReg). In the growing Glossary section of WattClarity, we’ve linked in several different contributions to explaining how dispatch works and how prices are set in the NEM . I’ve also highlighted the various rebid reasons and asked the question about whether the bids matched the criteria set out in the AER’s Rebidding Guidelines to follow on from the algorithm we developed for use first in our Generator Report Card 2018 . Details about the AER’s Rebidding Guidelines, and how we use these in determining whether rebids are ‘Well Formed’, is also included in the Glossary here . (D2) Don’t forget that FCAS (really) matters A couple years ago now, guest author Jonathon Dyson penned an article titled “Let’s talk about FCAS” as a general wake-up call to us all – and that’s certainly what was the case yesterday evening! With the Heywood interconnector tripped, all nine services (ENERGY + 8 x FCAS Services) needed to be procured from within the South Australian region. Here’s the ‘Swim Lanes’ view again, focused on 18:35 – but accompanied by 3 different views of ‘Current Bids’ – each of has been filtered to focus on three separate FCAS commodities which we see have spiked over the period since Heywood link tripped: (D2a) Raise 6 Second Price at $717.98/MWh We see the price first spiked at 18:20 and has remained elevated for the 4 dispatch intervals shown there (to date). A ‘Price Setter’ icon is not shown on the bids for Raise 6 second price – that’s because it’s the Energy Offer for Osborne that’s involved in setting this price. Note here that there are bids at the bottom of the stack from both Hornsdale Power Reserve, and also from Dalrymple North BESS – being “raise” services, it makes sense that this is being discharge from the battery (i.e. acting like a generator). (D2b) Lower 6 Second Price at $14,700/MWh It took another dispatch interval (till 18:25) for this one to spike, but we see it lifting all the way to $14,700/MWh – with supply options just from Pelican Point, Torrens, and Osborne. Note here that there no bids here from the batteries shown in this dispatch interval in the image above, though they did bid : (i) Being “lower” services, it would be logical for this to be charging into the battery (i.e. acting like a load). (ii) Because they are ‘the other side’ of a two-sided market, ez2view users need to toggle to show bids for loads (not generators) in the above – and I had forgotten to do this (thanks to the reader who – very quickly – alerted me to this!) (D2c) Lower 60 Second Price at $4,699.69/MWh Third in the series I’ve chosen to highlight was Lower 60 second FCAS – where the price rose in the 18:25 dispatch interval and was still at the same level for 18:30 and 18:35. We see here more bid bands shown with volume allocated – but still only the three thermal stations. Same comment as above for the batteries (i.e. bidding as loads, not generators, in this case). Understanding why some of the bid bands offered for each of these commodities was not dispatched requires delving into the details of NEMDE’s co-optimisation process , which we don’t have time to do today… In the growing Glossary section of WattClarity, we’ve linked in several different contributions to explaining how dispatch works and how prices are set in the NEM . (D3) The line trip was at 18:06 – earlier than assessed above. Note that there’s a Market Notice published at 18:31 (so only visible in the 18:35 dispatch interval) which tells us that the line actually tripped at 18:06, so maybe 5 minutes earlier than what I had assumed from the data shown above . What did I miss , in this quick review of data at the time, that would have alerted me to the trip in the prior dispatch interval? (E) Heywood returned by 23:10 (5 hours later) There’s more I could go on with here, but to wrap this up at this point I will just note that Heywood returned to service in the 23:10 dispatch interval, as shown here: ——————– That’s all I have time for on a Sunday, as a first (but probably only) review – don’t forget to let me know what I have missed, or misunderstood! ——————– (F) PS – various comments from others from Monday 18th November The article was published on Sunday, and already we have seen a number of great questions and comments come in from others on social media (we only use Twitter and LinkedIn). So for reader’s benefits I have pulled them in here (and will update more, as time permits): Person who commented Comment on social media Allan O’Neil On Twitter here , Allan O’Neil commented that: “Biggest part of the story might be Alcoa Portland losing supply for 3-4 hours. Not good for potlines if the outage was that long.” That’s one implication I did not consider yesterday! Josh Stabler On LinkedIn here , Josh Stabler noted: “Real question: What happens if SA demand (after PV) was negative while the ICs were down? Does NEMDE actually survive…” An interesting question, given where demand in South Australia is headed … Perhaps some of the boffins at the AEMO can help answer this? Others? As time permits (and if I remember) I will link in others Thanks for the input!",

    "title": "3rd Case Study – Tailem Bend Solar Farm in SA Region on Wednesday 6th November 2019",
    "date": "08-11-2019 03:44:00 PM",
    "content": "Yesterday (Thursday 7th Nov) over on RenewEconomy, Giles Parkinson published this article about Tailem Bend Solar Farm in South Australia noting “This solar farm has to switch off every second day due to negative prices” . In doing this, Giles asked for a couple illustrations of operations of the solar farm over recent weeks, which we providing using our NEMreview v7 online software application. (A) About “Energy Foregone” – and (possibly) “Spot Revenue Foregone” As noted to Giles, and reflected in his article, as a approximation one can look at the gap between the (ASEFS-deemed) Availability of the unit and its Output to gain a sense of “Energy Foregone” . In the week shown in the chart copied in from Giles article here, there is a fair bit of “white space” – hence a significant volume of “Energy Foregone” that might be a surprise to some readers – this seemed to be the main thrust of Giles’ article: For our clients having accessed to licensed versions of our software you can access your copy of this same trend here for NEMreview users , and here for ez2view users . Just change the date range at the top of the chart to have a look at different periods. Readers should understand that there are several different reasons why any plant (including Tailem Bend Solar Farm (DUID = TBSF1)) might be available and yet not produce output – or produce lower output than availability. Two big ones are: Reason 1 = being constrained down (i.e. as a result of constraint equations); and Reason 2 = being dispatched down (i.e. as a result of how the unit has bid, and the outcomes of the NEMDE dispatch run). It’s important that readers understand the difference – discussed further below. However the main point I wanted to flag that drew my attention was what happened, in particular, on Wednesday 6th November (two days ago now) – where it appears that the Solar Farm not only saw a significant volume of Energy Foregone, but also a non-trivial volume of “Spot Revenue Foregone” because the trading price for the day never actually dropped below $0/MWh : 1) The lowest it reached was $1.44/MWh in the 12:00 trading period 2) In Giles article, he notes that the Solar Farm has a clause in the contract that requires the plant not to operate when prices are negative: Tailem Bend has an off-take agreement with Snowy Hydro that broadly requires it to switch off when wholesale electricity prices go into negative territory, although the details are likely to be more complex than that. 3) In our experience this type of arrangement is pretty common amongst more recent PPAs struck between retailers and new entrant generators – though we do have to remind ourselves that we don’t know the specifics of this particular arrangement with Tailem Bend Solar Farm. My quick calculation with the AEMO data from that day shows that the spot revenue foregone just for that day might have been a little over $10,000 . There are a number of simplifying assumptions made here – including that: 1) the trading prices in at least some of these dispatch interval would have been different (most likely lower) had the “foregone” energy been included in the dispatch process; plus 2) these kind of retrospective “could have made better decisions” processes commonly ignore the impact of risk and uncertainty in making decisions in real time in a NEM environment that can, at times, be stressful. Hence the number should be used as a guide (only) to the order of magnitude. Not sure about other readers, but missing out on $10,000 in a day might hurt a bit? (B) Animation of 10 hours on Wed 6th November Given that we have other reasons to invest time in putting Case Studies like these together, I was happy to invest a few hours to put this article together today to give some of our readers (including a growing number of new entrant generators who might be operating facilities similar to TBSF currently or in the near future) as some weekend reading. We’re getting quicker at these as well – though, as always, please note that there may well be mistakes in what follows because of the rush (and more generally just because I’m not perfect). (B1) Why we’re preparing (and sometimes publishing) these Case Studies We’ve posted two of these case studies recently ( RRSF1 on 10th Oct 2019 and DAYDSF1 on 3rd Sept 2019 ) and are likely to produce a number more of these in the coming weeks and months, some of which we might also share on WattClarity . These are the two primary reasons why we’re creating, and then posting, these Case Studies: Audience #1 Users of our ez2view software application – who seek to use the software to produce their own insights Audience #2 WattClarity Readers – who appreciate the insights freely shared on this information site Our prime focus is* our growing group of licensees to our ez2view software (the higher-end dashboard we provide to a growing number of Scheduled or Semi-Scheduled Generators operating in the market – amongst others). * when I say “is” what I really mean is “must be” as these clients are the means by which we have the wherewithal to share some insights more broadly on WattClarity.

As an outcome of the rapid/iterative development principles we’re operating under, we are producing several new ‘Bleeding Edge’ versions of the ez2view software every week. Part of this rapid development process is that we observe, tag, and then later analyse “interesting” events in the NEM through process such as Case Studies like these. These Case Studies help us to explore the degree to which our software (and specifically in this Case Study, one particular Widget amongst the 1,000s available – the “Unit Dashboard Widget” – helps to make levels of complexity clearer, and understandable . As the energy transition continues to progress, we see a growing number of new entrants begin operations as generators in the NEM, or (further upstream) investigate possibilities to develop their own generation. A number of these new entrants are coming onboard as clients (e.g. to use our ez2view software when operational, or more generally with our Generator Report Card 2018 and other products, and we’re intrigued by the prospects of other new ventures we’re involved with). However that is only a subset of the rapidly expanding number of organisations and individuals who are taking an increasingly close look at the National Electricity Market – with a broader group of people subscribing for update from WattClarity on days where new articles are published here. Given that we’re investing considerable effort (including input from some on our Customer Advisory Board) to create these case studies as a way of exploring specific nuances in the NEM we want our software to provide clarity about (which will flow through to benefit our growing group of software licensees), we reasoned that we may as well publish some (but not all!) of these, in order to provide value to the WattClarity readership (a broader group of stakeholders). There can be an added benefit to us in publishing these Case Studies – hence we ask our readers to help us understand the extent to which this event (and the broader implications of events like this) are clearer as a result of the Case Study? With the above two (overlapping, but also distinctive) audiences in mind, let’s start with the substance of the case study… (please do let us know what we have missed, or misunderstood, anything in the comments below or in the animation?) (B2) Here’s the Animation We’ll start this animation at 08:00 NEM time on the day, and run through through for ten hours until 18:00 (those not so familiar with the NEM are reminded that all times here are “NEM time” or UTC+10, so not local time in South Australia): As noted above, we’re very keen to learn what we have missed, or misunderstood , in the above animation (and follow-on discussions below). (C) Specific Points for Discussion Pulling some specific dispatch intervals and comments from the animation above, we thought it would be beneficial for some of our readers if we expanded on some points as follows: (C1) About “switching off when the price is negative” It’s mentioned a number of times in different media (in prior articles on WattClarity I will have talked about this before). We’re certainly fielding an increasing number of requests from different types of people who would like our assistance with this. However it is crucial for everyone to keep in mind the following very clear distinction between two very different types of generators*: * by “generators” we mean supply-side options, which would include storage facilities discharging – and also supply of Negawatts (should they be incorporated into the dispatch process under the rule change discussed here) Generator Type #1 Scheduled, and Semi-Scheduled Generators Generator Type #2 Non-Scheduled Generators, and Generators not even large enough to register with AEMO (though still spot exposed) With these plant the most important thing for readers to understand is that they cannot simply switch off when they don’t like the price they are getting. [well, actually, we did find this example here where it appears one wind farm did that – and have found other examples as well – but my point is that this is not what should be happening, according to my understanding of the Rules] There’s a good reason for this – in that it would make the AEMO’s job impossible to do (in terms of balancing supply with demand to keep the lights on) if everyone did what they wanted. Instead, generators that are Semi-Scheduled and Scheduled need to try to achieve the outcomes they want via the Bidding and Dispatch Process . Below a certain threshold the rules currently assume a lower level of sophistication amongst smaller generators – and a lower collective impact on balancing supply/demand. They are, in effect, allowed to “do what they want” by switching off if they don’t like what the price is for the region they are supplying into. This leeway, coupled with the fact that the AEMO also sometimes won’t even have visibility of these generators, does have the potential (when adding up across an increasing number of suppliers who are similarly incentivised) to make the AEMO’s Primary Role of ‘keeping the lights on’ a whole lot more difficult into the future. In our Generator Report Card 2018 , we included discussion ( Theme 13 in Part 2 – What’s the future for Participation Categories in the NEM? ) about the future implications of this leeway (amongst other things). The main point, here, is that we all need to be quite clear which category a “generator” (i.e. a supply-side option) fits into , as the way they are treated is very different! (C2) What’s the price trigger to use? We extend the table above to think about which price trigger to use – nothing is as simple as it might initially seem in the NEM, as there are multiple price triggers (including the following): Generator Type #1 Scheduled, and Semi-Scheduled Generators Generator Type #2 Non-Scheduled Generators, and Generators not even large enough to register with AEMO (though still spot exposed) Generators in this group need to recognise that there are essentially two main prices that they need to be aware of simultaneously : Price Type A = what they will be paid : A1) which includes all of the complications noted for the Non-Scheduled generators in the second column A2) this is coupled with the fact that (because the generators are larger in this type) the implications of producing at times of negative prices can be much more expensive . Price Type B = what they are dispatched on . B1) It’s important to note that this is a different price . B2) In our animations, it is shown as the CPD Price (visible in ez2view ), and the way that it is formed is quite complex (and depends on whether there is Intervention, and whether there is Constraint). These differences were very clear in the 09:45 dispatch interval highlighted below, where the dispatch price for 9:45 was $0/MWh but the CPD price was so much lower – and (at the same time) the forecast CPD price for 09:50 was also likely to be so much lower than the dispatch price but for a different reason . Contact us (+61 7 3368 4064 or this form ) if you need to know more about this… What complicates this further is that Scheduled and Semi-Scheduled generators are given targets by NEMDE based on bids they must place in advance of dispatch . Hence some added layers of complexity in trying to achieve outcomes that a generator might be happy with. Until 1st July 2021 ( when 5 Minute Settlement begins ) the NEM operates with 5 minute dispatch and 30 minute settlement. This presents a number of different implications for different parties. For spot-exposed, non-scheduled generators, it adds complexity to their operations even when they can “run when they want” . The main reason for that is that the actual price they will be paid for energy generated in a half-hour will only be known*, in reality, about 26 minutes into a 30-minute trading period : (a) in other words, you don’t know what you’ll get paid until its largely too late; (b) this is one of the challenges inherent in the 5/30 issue . * and even then, on occasions, prices can be revised. For many of our 20 years of operations we have worked with suppliers in this space to help them understand how to lower the risks inherent in this process. In contrast, we’ve seen what appears to be some pretty clumsy attempts to cope with this (in terms of negative prices) with other generators recently, and we’ve heard of others more directly – food for other Case Studies? We already have a number of smaller solar farms (i.e. much smaller than TBSF) as clients where our data feed triggers “turn off” signals for them in their control systems onsite, to curtail production at times of negative prices. Some have been operating for quite a while. Contact us (+61 7 3368 4064 or this form ) if you need to know more about this… The main point, here, is that there is some considerable complexity involved in interpreting the data published by the AEMO. You need to ensure you’re looking at the right data (as the animation above shows, there can be a large difference between the Correct and the Incorrect Price! ) (C3) Why does TBSF shift their volume all the way up to $14,700/MWh at the RRN? I can’t actually answer that question – though I could try to have a guess. It certainly does not seem immediately logical if all they were needing to do was avoid dispatch at times when the trading price for the half-hour was going to be below $0/MWh. Maybe there was some other reason that prompted them to do what they did. Hence I am very keen to hear back from people who can help us explain what some plausible reasons might be… Here’s the view from a different widget in ez2view (the ’Bids & Offers’ widget) focused just on TBSF and showing 10 days of history from 29th October through until the end of the day yesterday (Thursday 7th November): We note that at 09:55 all the volume offered at the unit was shifted all the way from –$1,000/MWh at the Regional Reference Node all the way up to the current Market Price Cap ($14,700/MWh at the Regional Reference Node). Furthermore, this pattern seems to have been repeated on 7 of the other 10 days shown in the window. It’s not clear to me why you would be doing this if all you wanted to do was avoid being dispatched a times of negative trading prices… Remembering that it’s impossible to truly know a participants motivation, that does not stop curious people (like me) from trying to guess – and it does not stop others from lapsing quickly to conspiracy theories (which is something I consciously try to avoid). If anyone can help me understand more, please shout! (C4) Being Off-Target in the 09:55 dispatch interval I’ve copied out the snapshot here for the dispatch interval ending 09:55, complete with the annotations used in the animation (click on the image for a large-size view): AEMO dispatched down the unit because it had priced itself (hugely) out of the market as a result of the 2nd rebid for the day. As its bid ROC Down rate was 17 MW/min, this equates to a total volume reduction of 85MW – which is why the unit was given a target of 7MW (down from the Initial level of 92MW measured at the start of the dispatch interval). In other words, it could not reduce fully to 0MW despite the fact that the volume was now offered well above the CPD Price. On top of this, we see that the TBSF short-changed itself in trying to meet the target – only reaching the “Actual” level of 18MW instead of the Target of 7MW. That means a Dispatch Error of –11MW (which also means, because TBSF is not enabled for Regulation FCAS, an Off-Target figure of –11MW . There’s two points to make and questions to ask here: (C4a) About Off-Target Based on the AEMO’s operational logic (which is now reverse engineered and coded into the ‘Unit Dashboard Widget’ in ez2view) we know that this will have exceeded the Small and Large Trigger Levels and incremented a counter towards being declared Non-Conforming. As noted in the animation, however, in the 10:00 the Target (of 0MW) was reached successfully and hence the error count was reset. For our Generator Statistical Digest 2019 project, we are contemplating reverse-engineering the Compliance Status for all units for every Dispatch Interval through 2019 and presenting on the “Second Page” results added in for each unit. We’d like to hear from you about the level of value you’d see in this type of thing? (C4b) Why would they miss their Target We could guess at a number of reasons why a plant might this might miss their target, on the assumption that it was automatically fed through to their SCADA system directly via AEMO. However we would rather not guess, and would like to hear from people who can help us understand why? This particular dispatch interval was quite of interest to us, as it packed in a lot of different machinations – however that’s all we have time for now…. (C5) Structure of the rebidding for TBSF and bids “Not Well Formed” Here’s that 10-day view from the ’Bids & Offers’ widget again: This time we’d like to draw your attention to the comments in Orange down the bottom of the image, related to an interpretation of (and coding up to automatically parse)the AER’s Rebidding Guidelines. ——————————————————————— We’ve pieced this page together in a Glossary section of the WattClarity website to explain our understanding of Rebidding (and will endeavour to keep it updated as our understanding evolves – and as the AER’s procedures change, such as with 5 Minute Settlement. As noted on that page, we investigated “Bids Well Formed” as one of the many different metrics analysed for our Generator Report Card 2018 , and are keen to explore this further (at a discrete unit level) for our (possible) follow-on Generator Statistical Digest 2019 for publication in January 2020 . ——————————————————————— In this table (and in the animation of rebids made on 6th November) we see that the form of the rebids would not pass a strict automated coding of the AER’s Guidelines. From the table in the image above, we noted the rebid reason given in the Rebid received by the AEMO on 14:00 on 2nd Nov 2019 which simply says: E No re-bid reason. Negative Price Forecast We wonder what happened there, to prompt this? Is the “E” supposed to represent “Error” as the Rebid Category? (C6) Reasons behind the rebid Looking past the structure of the rebid to try to guess the underlying reasoning behind them , I’ve tried (in the time available) to understand more – as this understanding will help us further enhance our software for the future (software which is used both by Semi-Scheduled generators to help them with their own units, but also by others to look at the activities at units that are not their own). (C6a) 1st rebid taking effect 08:30 The first rebid (submitted at 08:22 and received at the AEMO at 08:23) is prior to the cut-off, so takes effect in the next (i.e. 08:25) NEMDE run for the 08:30 dispatch interval. This has the effect of delaying (by 60 minutes) the shift in volume up to the Market Price Cap. Through the rebid reason we guess that what the trader is saying is that the position of the forecast pricing in the SA-50 and SA-100 and SA-200 sensitivities for the 09:00 and 09:30 trading periods (i.e. the only ones at this end of the day affected by the rebid) looks more favourable. Because the requirement is on all participants to place rebids as close as possible to the change what prompted the reason for the rebid, we conclude that this must have been with respect to the immediately prior Sensitivity run. Thankfully with the ‘Sensitivities’ Widget in ez2view and the more general Time-Travel functionality we can check our hypothesis against actual historical data, and are pleased to see that this matches what the data says: The only other point I can make today about this 1st rebid is that there was a gap of about 20 minutes between when the new run of sensitivities data was published and when the rebid decision was made. Given that many of the rebid decisions (as noted in the 10-day table above) were referenced to changes in sensitivities, we would presume that the trader had ready access to some form of widget like that above to quickly compare sensitivity results. (C6b) 2nd rebid taking effect 09:55 In contrast to the first rebid (which delayed the bid price increase) the second rebid brought it forward by 2 dispatch intervals. Again this is referenced to “negative price sensitivities” so again we have a look at the ‘Sensitivities’ Widget in ez2view, Time-Travelled to the 09:45 dispatch interval to show the data that should have been visible at the time: Given that the rebid really only changed price bands for the 10:00 trading period (i.e. dispatch periods 09:50, 09:55 and 10:00 not elapsed at the time the bid was submitted ) it’s only really relevant to looking at the top row of the table (i.e. the change in negative sensitivities for the 10:00 trading period). In this case we see that the SA-100 and SA-200 have gone down in percentage terms, but the SA-50 has gone up, so my hypothesis of their reasoning is not as clear as in the 1st Rebid Case. (C6c) 3rd rebid taking effect 15:25 As noted in the animation, this had the effect of bringing forward the scheduled drop in price bands back to –$1,000/MWh ( which presumably happens because the trader thinks there is less risk of price dropping negative as solar winds down through the afternoon?): Note on this instance that the trader says “positive price expected” and that this does not particularly reference sensitivities – so we wonder what this means. With access to the ‘Forecast Convergence’ Widget in ez2view we Time-Travel to 15:20 (i.e. the dispatch interval in which the rebid is made) and have a look at how successive P5 forecasts for the SA price were changing: Looking up verticals (i.e. through successive forecast runs for the same dispatch interval) we see that the price colours are generally becoming warmer near the top of the table – however we do wonder about what prompted the rebid now, given that prices had been above $0/MWh for the whole day? That’s all the rebids that were made on the day, and we have no more time to dig currently. If learned readers can help us understand these above, we would be keen to hear from them, please? (C7) Variability in ASEFS Availability forecast I have no more time today to post specifically about this – but was curious about some pronounced ‘bouncing around’ of ASEFS availability forecast for the plant that we can see in the progressive slides of the animation above (the dotted red line on the chart shows the availability). We would like to learn more about what might cause this to happen so would ask that learned readers contact us about this, please? . (D) Do you know of people who can help us? I posted this short note yesterday about the types of assistance we’re looking for , as I knew I would want to refer back to it on occasions like this. If you know of people who can work with us in some way to help us help our clients better, then please let us know (or point them in our direction). . (E) The Generator Statistical Digest 2019, to trend some of the statistics above We’re investigating the possibilities related to the compilation and publication of a Generator Statistical Digest 2019 covering 10 years of data to 31st December 2019 and released in January 2020. The kind of statistics shown in the ez2view images above are the types of things we’re considering including in this document as trends over time. Yesterday I contacted a number of people via email (might be in your inbox?) to ask for their input into this process. If you have thoughts on this, we would certainly like to hear from you.",

    "title": "Insights: How do weather patterns impact wind REZ correlations?",
    "date": "06-11-2019 03:32:00 PM",
    "content": "As the Australian renewable energy market reaches a turning point in its development cycle, the diversification of wind production has become a key consideration for investors and policymakers seeking to maximise investment in wind energy, while minimising regional and portfolio wind power variability. At the system level, new interconnectors and Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) are intended to (among other things) help smooth the variability of renewable energy supply by expanding the market for excess renewable energy production and supplying additional energy during periods of low wind and solar production. At the same time, many investors have turned to portfolio smoothing to levelise production and earnings variability, and improve resilience to adverse conditions, under the assumption that if it is not windy in one location it will be windy in another. The increasing importance of wind correlation The strength of wind diversification within a portfolio (or region) is commonly measured by the degree of wind resource correlation between facilities. Correlation statistics have therefore become crucial for investors to measure risk – such as portfolio dependence, project exposure to revenue risks (such as revenue cannibalisation caused by correlated wind or solar production pulling down spot prices) and curtailment risks (associated with energy security and/or transmission congestion). Recent analysis in the Generator Report Card 2018 by Global-Roam and Greenview modelled wind speed correlation between REZs (based on the nearest weather station) over an 11 year period to 31 December 2018. As shown in Figure 1, analysis found generally strong correlation, particularly through NSW, with few findings of anti- or negative-correlation, where average wind speed increases in one REZ while decreasing in another. Figure 1: Wind speed correlation by REZ Source: Global Roam/Greenview, Generator Report Card 2018, published 31 May 2019. Large image . Readers should note this prior article that describes the three general states possible with this correlation function . Given the generally positive correlation of wind across REZs, analysis noted that the future build out of ‘geographically diversified’ wind farms would do little to change the underlying characteristic of the system, while transmission links between regions that are positively correlated may be sub-optimal if they experience similar weather patterns. Correlation versus meteorological dependence While correlation analysis is a key part of project/portfolio and system analysis, it does not tell the whole story of wind relationships across different regions, with little context for how specific weather patterns may be driving wind correlations at a place and point in time, or how system-wide correlations change under different weather patterns (and how frequently these patterns occur). While the features of large-scale weather patterns inform day-to-day variability in wind speed, meteorological dependence between wind projects (i.e. the degree to which different projects are harvesting the same weather patterns) is not widely considered in investment decision making due to the complexity and scale of required processing. Recent advances in data science and computing, however, have led to the development of more sophisticated models to analyse increasing volumes and velocity of meteorological data. Earlier in the year we released our advanced analytics model, EnerRISK (energy variability risk), which models the link between large-scale weather patterns and site-level wind production. EnerRISK applies data science techniques to identify the dominant meteorological regimes that drive low- and high-wind periods across different regions, drawing on climate forecasting systems to model long-term change in atmospheric conditions – and wind production. Building on Global Roam and Greenview analysis, insights into how different weather patterns impact wind production, and force changes in underlying spatio-temporal correlation, has the potential to add depth to the analysis of metrological risk across the energy system, and within individual regions and portfolios. Linking wind REZ production to weather patterns Drawing on our EnerRISK model, below we depict average diurnal wind speed for REZs in southern Australia in 2017-18, averaged over the hours aligning with six dominant meteorological patterns across the region, identified in our earlier White Paper . Each pattern has a different frequency of recurrence (refer to the brackets next to each heading), with the combination of all six patterns representing the average diurnal wind profile for all hours. Key notes: Analysis encompasses all REZs across southern Australia, including non-wind REZs such as hydro REZs in eastern VIC and southeast NSW, and solar REZs in northwest Victoria and eastern SA, included for comparative purposes; Note the changing scale of the y-axis (wind speed), with patterns 1, 2 and 6 representing strong wind clusters, while patterns 3, 4 and 5 represent weaker wind Figure 2: Average diurnal wind speed by REZ (by weather pattern) Source: RepuTex Energy (EnerRISK), 2019. Large image Breaking down wind output in line with the weather patterns that drive production enables the deeper analysis of seemingly random generation patterns, helping to inform a range of analysis, such as wind-ramps, price variability or storage opportunities. For example, as noted in our earlier White Paper , windy patterns 1 and 2 (cool and warm storm patterns) are identified as capturing the lowest regional prices in SA and VIC, reflecting the cannibalisation effect of wind generators operating near their rated capacity, pushing the electricity supply curve to the right and pulling regional clearing prices lower. Comparably, in times of low wind (patterns 3, 4, and 5), regional prices are generally higher to support higher marginal-cost generators, e.g. gas-fired. We also gain a deeper understanding of how different weather patterns drive diurnal wind profiles. For example, in Figure 2 we see two distinct diurnal profiles in line with low and high wind periods – and more specifically – under sunny and cloudy conditions. In cloudy patterns associated with storm activity, we see patterns 1, 2 and 6 have higher wind speeds (note the changing y-axis). Comparably, during sunny conditions we see patterns 3, 4, and 5 have depressed winds, particularly during daylight hours, ramping up in the late afternoon- evening. This could indicate opportunities for the co-location of wind and solar, particularly in regions where these patterns recur more frequently. How do weather patterns impact REZ correlations? In Figure 3, we depict diurnal wind speed correlation between REZs, broken down by weather pattern (note analysis maps diurnal correlation and is therefore not directly comparable to Global Roam). Results are clustered into regions, with stronger positive- negative relationships (over all hours) grouped together, to more clearly depict interactions between different regions. Figure 3: Diurnal wind speed correlation by REZ (by weather pattern) Source: RepuTex Energy (EnerRISK), 2019. Larger image . When wind correlations are categorised by weather pattern, we gain an alternative view of regional wind relationships, with areas of anti-correlation (in green) visible under clear sky associated weather patterns. For example, under high/steady wind (very low prices) in Pattern 1, we see most regions are positively correlated (as expected), yet with pockets of anti-correlation for wind resources in eastern REZs, such as Gippsland and the Southern NSW Tablelands. Anti- correlation for these regions is not necessarily a silver bullet, however, with the benefits of diversity (for investors or the grid) during these hours offset by strong wind production across most regions (see Figure 2). Under Pattern 2 (gusty winds, low prices), we again see positive correlations, but weaker relationships between South Australian and Victorian REZs, largely attributed to more southerly storm winds during warmer weather conditions. A similar profile is seen under Pattern 6 (moderate winds and prices). Within patterns 3, 4, 5 (lower winds and higher prices), we see similar shapes – with anti- correlation again visible in eastern REZs, e.g. Gippsland and southwestern (hydro) REZs – and much stronger correlations between western Victoria and eastern South Australia regions. Unlike Pattern 1, anti-correlation during these hours may represent a larger benefit (for investors and/or system reliability) given the lower relative wind speeds across most wind-REZs, and higher regional prices. Implications for system diversity and portfolio risk Wind speed and direction is highly dependent on metrological conditions. We therefore see significant differences in correlation when regional circulation patterns are used to re-categorise analysis of market and system risk. The framing of how and when meteorological factors impact wind correlations (and how often these patterns change under future atmospheric conditions) is therefore of high value for decision makers. For example, by understanding the interaction between weather patterns and wind correlations, market operators and policymakers can quantify the resilience of future highly renewable energy regions as more renewables are integrated into the system, while better estimating performance under extreme adverse weather conditions. For investors, a deeper understanding of meteorological risk within portfolios is also of considerable benefit to the analysis of portfolio resilience, helping to inform the degree to which different wind projects harvest the same patterns, and the magnitude of a portfolio’s risk (or resilience) to future changes in metrological conditions.

    "title": "Combined Solar & Storage Economics: Creating a credible grid scale business model in the National Electricity Market",
    "date": "05-11-2019 12:43:00 PM",
    "content": "Solar-Battery Hybrid Business Model This article is a re-written summary of our findings regarding a business model for the All-Energy 2019 conference in October 2019. This business model compromised a battery, solar farm and hedge contracts. In our view, investing in a battery, solar farm or hedging contract in isolation is speculative, and each of these potential revenue streams is impacted by underlying spot price volatility. As an alternative, the use of these in combination is complementary and may improve revenue certainty. This portfolio approach is essentially the same as that taken by conventional generation. Solar farm model To perform this study, we first created a model of a hypothetical solar farm located at Brisbane airport where we sourced 5 years of hourly solar data (2014-2018). This solar farm had a 20MW DC peak rating and historic half-hourly spot prices were employed. The revenue for each half-hour was calculated and when the annual results were summarized, annual Earnings per unit of energy averaged between $56 to $112/MWh, as shown in figure 1. Figure 1 – Annual revenues and average price for Brisbane Airport 20MW solar farm Energy Storage Economics In my work in the last four to five years, I’ve examined many business cases for energy storage in Residential, Commercial & Industrial and Utility scale projects. Whilst it’s true that the cost side economics improve with scale, usually revenues may be less per unit of energy and much less certain. It’s also observable that almost all large (>1MWh) batteries rely upon subsidy or are “proof of concept”. Under this scenario, uncertainty in revenue makes financing difficult and significant equity investment is required for a battery project to be realised. It is likely that the most certain business case for a large battery is for regular demand reduction each month/year where a stable network demand tariff exists. To examine the value of battery earnings, we measured arbitrage in Queensland over 20 years using “perfect foresight” where the battery charges at the lowest priced periods and discharges at the highest price periods every single day. It should be noted that we would expect actual performance to be less than this as you cannot predict with certainty when the prices will be highest and especially because of the impact of price spikes late in the half-hour which were unexpected. (*Currently the energy market dispatches every 5 minutes but financially settles as the half-hourly average, which will change to 5-minute settlement from July 1, 2020, so we have charted both in figure 2) We also assumed that the batteries had 90% round trip efficiency, performed only a single cycle every day and compared different C-ratings. C-rating Charge/Discharge Time 2.0 C 30 minutes 1.0 C 1 hour 0.5 C 2 hours 0.25 C 4 hours Table 1 – C-rating vs Charge/discharge time The calculated values in figure 2 are $/MWh daily average for the year i.e. annual returns will be that value multiplied by 365/366 days. Figure 2 – Arbitrage performance QLD Frequency Control Ancillary Services In addition to wholesale market arbitrage an Energy Storage that is large enough (>=1MW) can participate in Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) that AEMO uses to keep the energy market within frequency limits and the grid stable. There are eight markets that exist (Raise (Regulation & Contingency (6s, 60s, 5 minute)) & Lower (Regulation & Contingency (6s, 60s, 5 minute)). Historically, this has been approximately $200m/pa (~1% of energy market) in 2017 and 2018. This is highly variable, worth little most of the time, but highly valuable for short periods of time. It is also extremely difficult to forecast, so we have ignored this revenue opportunity in the interests of maintaining model simplicity. We have however prepared some summary charts of these market values in the following charts. Figure 3 – FCAS Service revenues by Year (2016-2018) Figure 4 – 4-weekly revenue totals for FCAS from 2016-2018 Modelling Solar & Battery Behaviour We modelled the solar farm, battery and contract together. It’s important to understand that to keep this analysis simple we also turned off settings that we’d usually employ such as battery and PV degradation, and we did not employ any constraints on the connection point (i.e. both battery and solar farm can operate at full power, anytime). Figure 5 shows a day of sample output from the model. Figure 5 – Modelled output 5th Jan 2014 Hedging Contracts There are a few common contracts available in the National Electricity Market Flat Swap Contract (24/7 for quarters/years) Cap Contract contracts that pay when spot price exceeds $300/MWh Peak swap contracts (7am to 10pm, working weekdays) For our analysis, we will employ peak swaps as these are the closest standard contract to a solar profile as there are no hedges in place at night when there is no solar generation. This is an Imperfect hedge, but the product has market liquidity because of demand from retailers. We have chosen to hedge at level to minimise average exposure to effectively zero, which is illustrated in figure 4 (i.e. on average, A+B+C=0). This value was 8.0 MW. Figure 6 – Representative hedging We have used an ASX energy price of Calendar 2020 price of $87/MWh in Queensland from late October as a representative price ( www.asxenergy.com.au ). Modelling Results The total revenues were then added for the battery, solar farm and contract position. As expected, the physical assets provide a variable but positive return but, in this modelling, the contract position cost money in 2017 but was positive in all other years. This would be expected as selling a hedge is an insurance to the buyer. Notably, in the long run, the contract was revenue positive and improved revenue certainty. We kept the battery as small as possible, so our default analysis used an 8MW, 2.0C battery. Figure 7 – Financial results of hybrid model Whilst we used a 2.0C battery, we have not assumed a cost for the solar farm and most importantly, the battery. Further modelling was performed, where a lower C-rating was employed but the battery power remained constant at 8.0 MW, which allowed us to examine the additional improvements in both financial return and certainty by purchasing additional capacity, against our 2.0C reference case. The results are shown in table 2. Year 0.25C 0.5C 1.0C 2.0C 2014 $ 84.99 $ 79.40 $ 74.43 $ 71.43 2015 $ 87.42 $ 81.06 $ 75.16 $ 72.30 2016 $ 103.86 $ 95.16 $ 88.63 $ 85.32 2017 $ 156.27 $ 146.25 $ 136.78 $ 131.71 2018 $ 88.15 $ 83.45 $ 79.94 $ 78.07 Average (All years) $ 104.14 $ 97.06 $ 90.99 $ 87.77 Breakeven Marginal Cost $/kWh battery $ 254.04 $ 336.66 $ 349.57 – Table 2 – Financial results by C rating What these results show is that additional capacity in terms of energy adds certainty and improves revenue but if we measure the additional revenue against the capacity, we can measure a break-even marginal cost. This breakeven cost indicates the capital cost a battery would need to beat to make the additional capacity purchase worthwhile. Concluding Remarks We have taken a portfolio approach using a renewable generator, a battery and contracts rather than attempting to gamble future returns solely on a battery. This is essentially what most professional generation companies have been doing for decades. In this limited 5-year analysis, we have shown that this combination is effective in producing a revenue stream that is above expected PPA’s or simply taking spot revenues. Delving a little deeper into the economics, if 2.0C battery is assumed to be $1000/kWh, the implied cost to structure is around $10/MWh, possibly a cost that could be borne by the solar farm owner. Fundamentally, selling a contract is selling insurance, which earns a premium in the long term, with battery a risk mitigation to manage cash flow and also providing dispatchability in the wholesale market. We would expect that greater interest in this business structure will develop as battery costs fall. Note: We also prepared a detailed report of the Hornsdale Power Reserve’s Tesla battery at Jamestown in South Australia.

    "date": "03-11-2019 12:54:00 PM",
    "content": "Eight days ago we noted ( in this article ) how the AEMO had been forecasting a Scheduled Demand down at the level of 352MW for Saturday afternoon, 26th October 2019 – and how it missed that level by about 200MW on the day . There are several different reasons why the actual demand on the day was significantly higher than forecast (especially in percentage times) – that’s food for a different article as time permits. Today, however, we might go very close to that low level – at the time of writing, the lowest (so far) today was down at 367MW for the 12:00 dispatch interval – with the general conditions this afternoon captured in this snapshot a little later from NEMwatch v10 : Updating the same trend in NEMreview v7 from a week ago, we see that clearly today’s demand level (even just at the 367MW level it’s dropped to so far today) is the lowest point seen in South Australia for “Scheduled Demand” since the start of the NEM , excluding the SA System Black event . : See this earlier (and longer!) article for the gory details of the different ways that “demand” is measured in the NEM to understand what’s different between Scheduled Demand (the measure that has been used the longest) and Operational Demand (which AEMO is increasingly using, but has limited history).

    "title": "NSW LOR and AEMO request for Generator Recall information",
    "date": "30-10-2019 03:41:00 PM",
    "content": "Yesterday, Tuesday 29 October 2019, AEMO issued a Market Notice requesting Generator Recall information from participants in the NSW region. This was issued at 15:27 on Tuesday 29 October 2019, and came after numerous Lack of Reserve notices, the first of which was at 1103 hrs forecasting a LOR 2 for Wednesday 30 October 2019. MARKET NOTICE 070782 __________________________________________________________ Notice ID 70782 Notice Type ID RECALL GEN CAPACITY Notice Type Description MARKET Issue Date 29 October 2019 External Reference Request for Generator Recall Information for the period from 0730 hrs to 1230 hrs 30/10/2019 for Region NSW __________________________________________________________ AEMO ELECTRICITY MARKET NOTICE Please provide Generator Recall Information for the period from 0730 hrs to 1230 hrs 30/10/2019, by 19:00 hrs on 29/10/2019 via the Generator Recall communication system, in accordance with the SO_OP_3719 Procedure for Submitting Generator Outage Recall Information. SO_OP_3719 Procedure for Submitting Generator Outage Recall Information is available at: http://www.aemo.com.au/-/media/Files/Electricity/NEM/IT-Systems-and-Change/2018/Guide-to-Generator-Recall-Plans.pdf Manager NEM Real Time Operations The background in the lead up to this are the forced outages at the NSW coal fired power stations. This time of year is part of “outage season” where thermal power stations schedule their planned maintenance outages, otherwise known as overhauls, which are planned years in advance. Some of the units out service appeared to be on overhaul, but many were not. As at Saturday Morning 26 October, there were six Units out of service in NSW: Eraring1 Eraring 3 Bayswater 4 Liddell 2 MT piper 1 MT Piper 2 A little explanation of each: Eraring 1 – out of service from 25 September with reasons including Forced Limitations, Plant Conditions – ID fan issues. Assumed to be a forced outage. Eraring 3 – last ran on 24 August, shutting down shortly after a period of flame testing. Liddell 2 – Heavily reduced in capacity before coming off on 19 October, but not many rebids referring to what the plant conditions were, however in the bid from the previous day they had planned for it to come off on the 19 th . This is a little grey; Assume an unplanned maintenance outage. Bayswater Unit 4 – judging by the way it was bid on the day it last ran, the 1 August, it looks like a planned outage. Vales Point was the only NSW coal fired power station in the last few weeks available to run at full capacity. At 1030 hrs Saturday morning Bayswater Unit 3 tripped, and seems to have had a few complications as normally a return to service from a trip would be within a couple (2 to 3) hours. But at 1900 hrs a rebid was submitted citing “auxiliary plant failure” which is enough information for a rebid, but quite vague in terms of telling us exactly what the issue was. However, suffice to say they had some issues. Then on Monday evening Unit 2 reduced to 400 MW, some 60% of their registered capacity, quoting “plant failure”. They then nursed it until 1330 hrs yesterday afternoon when they took it off line. That left just one Bayswater Unit out of four in service. Over the last few months we have observed MT Piper, (two Units at 700 MW each), generating less and less. Often only generating with one Unit, and even then, at half capacity, and more recently both Units off completely. From reading various reports the mine that supplies coal to the station are having difficulty delivering enough coal of reasonable quality to the station. MT Piper have only been available to generate 12 days this month, the first 7 days of the month before bidding both Units unavailable on the 8 th October, and then briefly running from the 22 to the 26 October. So, yesterday we had: Vales Point at 100% capacity Liddell at 70 % capacity Bayswater at 25% capacity Eraring at 50% capacity MT Piper at 0% capacity. At at 1527 hrs AEMO released the Market Notice 70782 requesting generators to advise of any Recall Capacity to help them assess. The Recall Generation request is a preliminary step AEMO take to help them assess whether they need to intervene in the market. Section 1.1 from the SO_OP_3719 Procedure states “When there are foreseeable circumstances which may require AEMO to intervene in the NEM, AEMO may initiate contact with Scheduled Generators to seek details of any capacity that can be recalled and the associated recall time. This is necessary for AEMO to determine a latest time to intervene in the absence of a market response, for the purposes of NER clause 4.8.5A. It is important for AEMO to obtain this information efficiently and in a quality assured manner within operational timeframes to provide an integrated picture to inform AEMO’s operational decisions.” Section 3.1 states “Where AEMO foresees that heightened risks to power system security or reliability of supply may require AEMO to intervene in the market, AEMO will publish a market notice under NER clause 4.8.5A(a). This notice is not a declaration of an AEMO intervention event, but of the forecast circumstances that might require AEMO to intervene.” From 1100 hrs yesterday through to today there have been various market notices pointing to LRC conditions in NSW for 30 Oct and the 31 Oct. It does not look like AEMO have given any participants a direction, as yet, but the reserves in NSW are pretty low right now. Lucky demand is also low..

    "title": "Second Case Study (Daydream Solar Farm on Tuesday 3rd September 2019) – another eventful day",
    "date": "30-10-2019 07:08:00 AM",
    "content": "Back on 14th October, we published this Case Study of Ross River Solar Farm operations through Thursday 10th October 2019 . We received a number of points of feedback from readers about this, including from a number of new entrants – with these readers thanking us for helping to make some aspects of Semi-Scheduled plant operation more visible and understandable. Thanks for the feedback! For similar reasons, we’re adding this second Case Study today – but focused on a different generator this time. It just so happens that this case study: (a) also focuses on a Semi-Scheduled Solar Farm; (b) where the asset is also operating in northern Queensland (so is suffering from ”the crunch” noted back a year ago now ). Other case studies will follow in due course – not all of them focused on solar, and not all of them focused on northern Queensland. If you know of other interesting events in the NEM you’d like us to illustrate using a similar mechanism, please do let us know (details at the bottom of the article)? Note that (because of where we are focused with the software at present) we’re particularly interested in looking at operations at a particular DUID, rather than a broader collection at this point . (A) Recapping why we’re posting Case Studies As with the first Case Study (RRSF1) we are posting this Second Case Study knowing that (in trying to address two different audiences through this single article) I might end up not being as clear with either audience as I might otherwise be. These are the two primary reasons why we’re creating, and then posting, these Case Studies: Audience #1 Users of our ez2view software application – who seek to use the software to produce their own insights Audience #2 WattClarity Readers – who appreciate the insights freely shared on this information site Our prime focus is* our growing group of licensees to our ez2view software (the higher-end dashboard we provide to a growing number of Scheduled or Semi-Scheduled Generators operating in the market – amongst others). * when I say “is” what I really mean is “must be” as these clients are the means by which we have the wherewithal to share some insights more broadly on WattClarity. It’s software that’s unashamedly focused on the physical market – focused on providing answers to questions like ‘why did that happen?’ We’ve invested $MIllions in R&D for ez2view in prior years, and investment path that will continue into the future as the level of complexity facing wholesale market participants continues to grow. As an outcome of the rapid/iterative development principles we’re operating under, we are producing several new ‘Bleeding Edge’ versions of the ez2view software every week. Part of this rapid development process is that we observe, tag, and then later analyse “interesting” events in the NEM through process such as Case Studies like these. These Case Studies help us to explore the degree to which our software (and specifically in this Case Study, one particular Widget amongst the 1,000s available – the “Unit Dashboard Widget” – helps to make levels of complexity clearer, and understandable . As the energy transition continues to progress, we see a growing number of new entrants begin operations as generators in the NEM, or (further upstream) investigate possibilities to develop their own generation. A number of these new entrants are coming onboard as clients (e.g. to use our ez2view software when operational, or more generally with our Generator Report Card 2018 and other products, and we’re intrigued by the prospects of other new ventures we’re involved with). However that is only a subset of the rapidly expanding number of organisations and individuals who are taking an increasingly close look at the National Electricity Market – with a broader group of people subscribing for update from WattClarity on days where new articles are published here. Given that we’re investing considerable effort (including input from some on our Customer Advisory Board) to create these case studies as a way of exploring specific nuances in the NEM we want our software to provide clarity about (which will flow through to benefit our growing group of software licensees), we reasoned that we may as well publish some (but not all!) of these, in order to provide value to the WattClarity readership (a broader group of stakeholders). There can be an added benefit to us in publishing these Case Studies – hence we ask our readers to help us understand the extent to which this event (and the broader implications of events like this) are clearer as a result of the Case Study? With the above two (overlapping, but also distinctive) audiences in mind, let’s start with the substance of the case study… (please do let us know what we have missed, or misunderstood, anything in the comments below or in the animation?) (B) Animation of DAYDSF1 on 3rd September 2019 The event we choose to look at today occurred 8 weeks ago today – back on Tuesday 3rd September in the Queensland region of the NEM, and specifically with respect to the Daydream Solar Farm. We noticed the event at the time but it’s taken some weeks for us to be able to publish this case study for a couple of reasons, including: (i) the general busyness we’re blessed with at present ( you might be able to help us with that – see at the bottom of this article), and also (ii) because we wanted to use this event to drive enhancements to the software such that it could be explained through a single widget in the software rather than multiple widgets. With the release of ez2view v7.4.5.591 on Monday 28th October we’re not yet finished with what we want to do, but are in a position to drop images into the following animation to share with you, and gain your input (thanks for input already from some – animation slightly updated) : This animation takes about 10 minutes to replay, and we did not have time to add audio. Please accept our apologies that we don’t have time to comprehensively explain all the different elements of this widget in the animation here. There is tool-tip functionality built into the software for clients, and (as with all the other widgets in ez2view) there is (or will be , in this case, when we have settled on a final design) detailed online help to assist (under the “?” icon on the widget). (C) Insights (and Questions) shared here today You might not have time, right now, to sit through the 10-minute animation above. For this reason, we’ve extracted a number of the key insights and questions we’ve noted through the animation – and would welcome your thoughts and feedback on any or all of these (either in public comments below, or one-on-one via the contact details at the bottom of the page)? (C1) Challenges with ASEFS early in the day At 07:40 on the morning we saw that the dispatch target provided to the plant by AEMO increased from 10MW (target for dispatch interval ending 07:35) to 57MW (target for 07:40). This target was derived by NEMDE because ASEFS had calculated that an output of 57MW was possible (i.e. local irradiance suggested that yield for the number of inverters in service) This meant a “Dispatch Error” calculated as +57MW (i.e. Target – Actual), which also equated to an “Off-Target” figure (with “Off-Target” being the same as “Dispatch Error” here because the unit is not enabled for Regulation FCAS). These numbers are important, because NEMDE is the algorithm used to balance supply and demand, so if a Dispatch Error of +57MW from any unit needs to be compensated for by supply elsewhere . : (i) In real time on the day, the absence of 57MW could mean other units in the Raise FCAS markets being called on to keep the frequency at 50Hz (all else being equal) (ii) Were such a phenomenon to be an ongoing occurrence, I would understand if it flowed into the requirements for increased FCAS enablement levels (hence increased market cost), for example. ——————————————————————— In our Generator Report Card 2018 , we took a look at a metric we called “Off Target” in the report (used a slightly different calculation) to perform a range of different analysis – including looking at the extent which large unexpected changes across the coal fleet had been a surprise to the AEMO, as one indicator of “Sudden Failure”. In ez2view now, with this version, we’ve implemented both “Dispatch Error” and “Off Target” as metrics derived dynamically from the data sets published for a (user-selected) DUID in a Dispatch Interval. There’s still a bit more we need to do to make “Off-Target” – and hence Compliance Status – correctly account for all instances of enablement of Regulation FCAS. Given that the end of the year is rapidly advancing, we’re contemplating the publication of a Generator Statistical Digest 2019 in January 2020 as a partial- update to the Generator Report Card 2018 . If we did this (and that’s still an if!), we would be keen to explore the performance of “Dispatch Error”, “Off-Target”, and “Compliance Status” across all DUIDs right across Calendar 2019. Contact us if you are interested… ——————————————————————— As noted in the animation, the positive Dispatch Error at +57MW was as large as the dispatch error reached through this day – but is something we would like to understand more about, more holistically. (C2) Constraint-induced CPD Price Divergence With the recent release by AEMC about documentation surrounding COGATI (yet another acronym to bury new entrants in) there has been talk about how some of the changes being contemplated would move the NEM from a regionally-priced market to one working with nodal prices. It’s important to understand that the NEM is already dispatched using nodal prices , it’s just that they are not very visible to wholesale market participants (and stakeholders more broadly). With the latest enhancements we have been working on in ez2view, we’re providing more easy visibility of translated nodal prices in the form of a “Connection Point Dispatch Price” (i.e. CPD Price – our own acronym, sorry to add to the load). ——————————————————————— Amongst other things, what COGATI might do is take the NEM’s starting point with nodally-priced dispatch and take a few steps further, with: (i) Use of dynamically calculated locational loss factors (rather than the forward-looking, annually-based Marginal Loss Factors currently used, or the forward-looking, annually based Average Loss Factors under consideration); and (ii) Extend the dynamic nodal prices through to settlements (rather than the current process which uses the regional reference price for settlements. (iii) Establishing some way to ensure there is the ability to hedge between disparate nodes (one of the challenges inherent in moving to nodal prices that has been known about since as far back as 1997 ). … but all of that is food for a separate article at some point. ——————————————————————— At 07:30 on the day, one form of the Central-South constraint binds, favouring generation south of the “central-south” transfer in QLD, compared to generation in the north. On this occasion (i.e. relatively early in the morning, with solar farms in northern QLD collectively contributing only a small amount) the divergence between the regional dispatch price (at $71.76/MWh) and the CPD price specific for DAYDSF1 (here at $65.73/MWh) was not huge: In this particular case, as well, it made no difference to the dispatch outcome, as the plant was (at that time) unable to produce any output despite having a dispatch target of 3MW. ——————————————————————— In November 2018 we noted about a crunch escalating for northern Queensland , with the rapid influx of new generation projects being constructed for operations in the northern half of Queensland (i.e. north of this central-to-south bottleneck). In one-on-one conversations since that time, it’s become clear that some of that message was lost in translation, as (it seems) it’s not just the central-to-south link that will be congested in future. It seems probable that there will also be congestion occurring between the northern and central areas of Queensland as well (in essence between the areas of Mackay and the area of Rockhampton) due to the volume of generation development in the north, the relatively small size of demand in the area, and the network capability. If/when this happens, we’ll see the outcome of this with CPD prices for projects like DAYDSF1 (and many others) down at –$1,000/MWh for increasing number of hours in the day, even if the regional price is well above $0/MWh . This will mean (even moreso) the days of ‘set and forget’ bidding for Semi-Scheduled solar and wind will be well and truly in the past. ——————————————————————— However the ‘crunch in northern Queensland’ is also food for a separate follow-on article at another point. (C3) Non-Conformance The MMS table “Dispatch Unit Conformance” table is private to individual participants for all time , meaning that it’s not possible for any participant (or other stakeholder) to see the explicit Compliance status of any other unit at any given Dispatch Interval. Some data is published (e.g. Market Notices – somewhat delayed, and Private Constraints – day after). Not to be dissuaded by this, in the version of ez2view used in this animation we have built our own reverse-engineering of the logic for the AEMO’s Operating Procedures which now works for all units in a historical context , including (we believe) correctly taking into account FCAS Regulation Enablement levels). We are very keen for the clients we have with access to private data for their own units to double-check the logic in order that it works correctly in all of these cases? I’ve lifted out the snapshot for 10:05 here which is the first dispatch interval in place where the Non-Conformance constraint was bound for DAYDSF1 . As noted in the animation, there were 13 dispatch intervals (through till 11:05) where the constraint was bound: However the story did not start at 10:05 but back at 09:25 where we saw a negative Dispatch Error of –23MW where the unit suddenly ramped up (from 0MW to 23MW) despite not having any availability deemed in ASEFS (and hence no dispatch target). We see: (i) 09:25 and 09:30 a similar story (with Dispatch Error up at a large –127MW at 09:30) (ii) 09:35 and 09:45, by our automated logic, AEMO declaring the unit “Off-Target” as a result of not following dispatch targets which were imposed then) (iii) Status upgraded to “Not Responding” for 09:45 and 09:50; then (iv) Upgraded further to “NC Pending” for 09:55; before (v) We calculate being declared “Non Conformance” for 10:00 (which would be 5 minutes before the constraint was bound). ——————————————————————— Worth re-iterating that we’re contemplating a longitudinal exploration of the incidence of these measures in a (possible) Generator Statistical Digest 2019 for publication in January 2020 . ——————————————————————— We’d very much like to understand if we have the logic correct, so are keen to hear from those who can help us – please get in touch at the contact details below? (C4) Bids being “Not Well Formed” Through the period of the animation there were 4 different bid structures* shown that were used at different points in the period of the Case Study. * note also that there were actually 5 different bid structures in play for the day, but one of them (unfortunately) did not even see a dispatch interval, for reasons explained in (C5) below. Worth re-iterating that none of these bids would satisfy our automated logic for being “Well Formed (Tight)”, which we have coded based on our interpretation of the AER’s Rebidding Guidelines. ——————————————————————— We’ve pieced this page together in a Glossary section of the WattClarity website to explain our understanding of Rebidding (and will endeavour to keep it updated as our understanding evolves – and as the AER’s procedures change, such as with 5 Minute Settlement. As noted on that page, we investigated “Bids Well Formed” as one of the many different metrics analysed for our Generator Report Card 2018 , and are keen to explore this further (at a discrete unit level) for our (possible) follow-on Generator Statistical Digest 2019 for publication in January 2020 . ——————————————————————— I’ve loaded in here a snapshot from a different widget in ez2view (i.e. the current version of the “Bids & Offers” widget), which lists each of the 5 bids in play for the day – only 4 of which were used: Note that all 4 of the rebids made on the day (3 of which were used): (i) Omitted the HHMM code to alert stakeholders (the AEMO, the AER, Market Participants and others like us) to the time at which the event occurred that triggered the need for the rebid (ii) Omitted the Category used to classify the rebid; and (iii) In the case of the last one, which just included a reason “Rebid”, does not appear to provide a brief, verifiable, contemporaneous record of the reason for the rebid. (C4) Plant technical issues As can be seen in the image above the operator at DAYDSF1 indicated that there were “plant technical issues” that were the reason* the rebids – and presumably were also the reason for the plant being Off-Target (and hence suffering declared Non-Conformance. ——————————————————————— * Readers should note that I am not suggesting that the participant needs to reveal more details in the Rebid Reason about what the specific technical issues were that were encountered at the time – though there should be a contemporaneous record which many participants store in an offline Bid Log (hence the “SL” – i.e. ‘See Log’) resource at the time. ——————————————————————— We would like to understand more about the nature of the technical issues that might arise at solar farms (or, indeed, any plant) that would lead to plant being unable to follow its dispatch targets. Understanding more about this might help us drive our software further, to help our clients understand more of the picture of what might be going on at times like this. If you can help us – or know of people who can – please get in touch (details below). (C5) Bid changes that have no effect In the bid table shown above there were 3 real changes in bid made through the day – none of which actually ended up having any effect on the NEMDE dispatch process for a few different reasons. It’s worth drilling into each of these, in turn, in order to help those new entrants amongst the readership keep in mind for their future operations. In order to do this, I have used the “Compare Bids” function within ez2view, which enables the user to compare specific changes made between two (user-selected) bids: 1st change in bid (from 08:30 to 08:35) At 08:24:23 the AEMO received a rebid from the participant that had “Plant technical issues” as the rebid reason. Because it did not contain a HHMM code in the reason we are not able to determine when the technical issues occurred, but we can guess that it had something to do with the fact that the plant was having difficulties starting (remember, above, that it was receiving dispatch targets because ASEFS said it should have output capability, but could not produce anything). As a result it is logical to think that the plant might have been bid out of the market (i.e. capacity removed up to the Market Price Cap) whilst the operator would have been trying to resolve the technical issues. Unfortunately it appears that, in the process of trying to do this, a mistake was made in the bid submission process leaving volume at $0/MWh, and hence the dispatch targets continued to ramp up in subsequent dispatch intervals. 2nd change in bid (from 09:45 to 09:50 – a ‘double banger’) This is the one where there was an un-dispatched bid that seemed to indicate another mistake. The 1st rebid above was used by AEMO in the NEMDE dispatch process for 15 sequential dispatch intervals. Presumably during this time, the generation operator was dealing with a few different things at once, including: a) Trying to rectify whatever the technical issues were at the time, which essentially amounted to two periods: (i) From 08:35 to 08:55 they were receiving non-zero dispatch targets, but seemingly unable to actually ramp up; but then (ii) From 09:25 to 09:45 they were ramping up quickly but a dispatch target stuck at 0MW (because of availability stuck at 0MW) – hence the Non-Conformance above. b) In parallel, we guess (remembering that it is impossible to know ) that there was a bit of head-scratching going on as they tried to work out why they were still getting non-zero dispatch targets, if the intent of the 1st rebid was to price capacity out of the market whilst they sorted out operations. As a result of this we see two bids offered submitted 2 seconds apart as follows: 2019-09-03 09:40:22 = volume moved negative As noted on the screenshot, in this particular case it appears as if the intent was to provide more opportunity to dispatch the plant if the CPD price were to drop below $0/MW (down to –$77.70/MWh) because of the way the bids were changed…. … however this bid did not ‘stick’… 2019-09-03 09:40:24 = volume removed Two seconds later , we see a second bid received at the AEMO – which superseded the prior one (which, as a result, never saw any action as part of the dispatch process). As a result, the net change in bid seen by NEMDE looks as follows: As noted here, the net effect of overwriting the rebid 2 seconds earlier was just to reverse the error made an hour prior in the first rebid – but this would have had no real effect on dispatch, as the NEMDE algorithm truncated the 300MW volume offered down to the 150MW maximum capacity of the unit. Was this a result of some sort of ‘fat finger’ mouse-click error on submission to AEMO? 3rd change in bid (from 10:45 to 10:50) An hour later, we see the third rebid affected on the day: … except that (unless we are missing something – in which case, please let us know?) it beats me what the purpose of this rebid was, as literally nothing appears to have changed in the rebid – other than (as discussed above) the Reason being changed to the entirely unhelpful text entry ‘Rebid’! With each of the changes above, it is important to understand that ( despite the fact that were still operating under 30-Minute Settlement for another 20 months) bids in the Energy & FCAS Markets already effectively operate on a dispatch interval (i.e. 5-minute) basis . Helpfully, our ez2view software has been representing bids on a dispatch interval basis for many years, making it much easier for clients to understand what’s actually happened. Might be worth checking that the tools you are using also do the same? (D) Can you help us? As we noted with this Case Study published on 14th October (thanks to those who responded there!) , we’re hoping that you might be able to put us in contact with others who can help us in either (or both) of the following ways. Market Analysts … who can help us understand more Software Engineers … who can help us build faster We’re keen to hear from those who can help us understand what we have missed , or misunderstood , in the Case Study above. That’s not the only role these ‘Market Analysts’ would play for us, and we have happy to discuss further (one-on-one) with interested parties. (a) For instance, we have a growing number of guest authors on WattClarity who are helping our readers by sharing their insights here – but importantly also helping us directly as well ! (b) These guest authors are a subset of the broader group of people who are helping us in various ways to understand different nuances of the NEM better and better … some part of our ‘Customer Advisory Board’. Our ‘ things to do’ listing (more formally called a ‘Backlog’) contains enough already to keep us going out till around 2030 or thereabouts – no joke. That list keeps growing in a variety of ways (e.g. we’ve added a number of additional insights, already, in the process of putting this Case Study together). It’s a nice position to be in – and we are grateful of our client’s appreciation of us in that: (a) A growing number of clients are using our software tools; and (b) There’s no shortage of helpful suggestions coming in from this expanding client base (some new, some 10+ years into a relationship). We’d like to be developing more quickly , if we could find a way to utilise additional resources who could hit the ground running with us (given what we’re doing, we don’t have a lot of time to focus on recruitment and elaborate onboarding currently). Hence it would take a pretty particular person to be able to slot in and contribute well at the present point in time. Hopefully this second case study above gives you some idea of the one of the activities we’re investing heavily in, aligned with our Reason-for-Being of “making the market more understandable, so our clients can make better decisions” ? Our prime focus needs to be the growing number of clients using ez2view (and/or our other software products) – but we’re also happy to share some insights like this Case Study to the readers of WattClarity. As noted at the top, there never seems to be an end to the ways in which we can continue to improve, and we wonder if you know of people who would easily slot into our team to help us do either or both of the following: We’re keen to talk with those who can help us in either (or both!) of these ways – and don’t have pre-set ideas for how these arrangements might work. Hence please do point them in our direction: (C1) Call us on +61 7 3368 4064 ; or (C2) Provide details for us on this feedback form .",

    "title": "Network connection traps for new generation developers",
    "date": "29-10-2019 03:12:00 PM",
    "content": "New generator development in the National Electricity Market (NEM) is extremely complex. However, with a tailored approach and the right planning and expertise, developers can avoid significant project delays and/or additional costs in the connection process. The key complexities and challenges to be considered by new generation developers in today’s market include: seemingly never-ending rule changes; navigating the competitive PPA market; competing for ever diminishing network capacity; wading through the minefield that is negotiating generator performance standards, constantly changing energy demand; ongoing policy uncertainty from the federal and state governments lack of clear investment triggers; understanding constraint equations and marginal loss factors and their impacts on generation dispatch; integration of rapidly developing technologies such as battery storage; resources at networks and AEMO being stretched to meet demand of the volume of new generation projects being developed; and appreciating and dealing with emerging technical issues like weak system strength with its causer pays arrangements for mitigation impacting on tight development budgets. With these obstacles breathing down the neck of developers, successful new generation project development can appear an extremely daunting task. Despite the plethora of challenges to balance in developing generation projects in the NEM, the area often cited by developers as the most complex and risky element of developing a new generation project is the grid connection process. Grid connection in the NEM can be extremely complex without the required knowledge and experience. Recently in the NEM, an underappreciation of these complexities and the level of focus required has resulted in significant delays to energisation of several projects and cost/revenue impacts. Network connection risks have seen energisation delayed; generation stuck at low hold points as well as losses/constraints biting. The flow-on financial impacts to developers, asset owners and even contractors has been dire. Like with any complex process, it is crucial to involve an appropriate level of experience and expertise in managing the grid connection process. Projects with more focused network connection planning and strategy tend to find an easier path to connection. As someone who has been involved in grid connections of new generation developments for over a decade, I have often been surprised at how under prepared many generation developers are to tackle the grid connection process. It seems commonplace to employ experts to lead the complex project streams of legal, PPA negotiations, EPC contact negotiations and land access requirements. Strangely though, just as common seemed developers’ expectations that the grid connection would look after itself, with little focus and almost as an afterthought once other key project milestones are locked away. It isn’t uncommon for developers to have spent months planning a development, then engage for the first time with the network to be told their project (as planned) has several network connection challenges. Often at this point the developer has made considerable commitments on the project which can lead to a decision to push ahead despite the network connection issues. While the traps and considerations for managing a successful grid connection process are numerous and detail around these are outside of the scope of this article, there are some simple traps that are very easily avoided with just a little careful planning and thought. The following are some of those traps that, while they might seem obvious, are mistakes that have been, and continue to be made by new grid connected generation developers. 1. Don’t treat networks like the enemy When working in a network business, too often I would see developers treat the networks like the enemy. It seemed only by defeating the network can the developer ‘win’. This approach no doubt came about because working with a monopoly network was a necessary evil. Network connections were considered a grudge purchase where the developer had to pay the network a whole heap of money for the connection with no ability to choose a preferred provider. Networks might be a monopoly, and developers might have little choice to work with them, however network monopolies are a double-edged sword. You might have no choice, but neither do they. The National Electricity Rules (NER) mandate networks are to work with all new connections, no matter how blue-sky a project might seem, no matter whether they think the project has a low probability of succeeding. Networks are obligated to work with all comers. This all takes time, effort and brain power. So, with that in mind, it is critical to work closely and collaboratively with the incumbent Network Service Provider (NSP). Treating networks as a critical part of the project team will go a long way to achieving a successful development. And remember, the people inside the networks may have significant experience in new connections and can be a great source of knowledge for developers. Treat them like a true project partner. 2. Early Network Engagement Further to treating networks like a partner in your project, it is crucial to engage with the incumbent NSP as early as possible. It isn’t uncommon for developers to leave network engagement (and engagement with other stakeholders for that matter) far too late in the development process. They would then impose unreasonable expectations on the network in terms of supporting an aggressive development schedule. Yes networks might charge for their time when they get into the detail of processing connection enquiries applications (because remember they have to deal with developers, so it’s not unreasonable that they charge for their effort) and this might be partly to blame for reservations in engaging with them. Often though you can grab them for a friendly coffee, give them an intro to you project and ask for some friendly advice, at no cost. At worst this early engagement would be at a relatively low cost considering the value that early engagement can provide. Understanding the network connection risks early will give you time to manage/mitigate them. Likewise understanding the timeframes for processing the network connection can assist you to build a more realistic project schedule, aligning the network connection to your key project milestones. This all helps to manage expectations and reduce surprises. 3. Avoid the 10/50 Rule (10% Cost, 50% effort) As a general rule, connections costs account for up to 10% of a development capex budget. Managing the connection process itself however can take up to 50% of a developer’s time and effort. This level of effort is disproportionate to the representative value of the network connection. Typically, this significant amount of time invested in the connection process is due to getting the process wrong or starting it too late. Without a clear strategy to navigate the connection process, things do and will go wrong and developers will fall into the trap of having to spend considerable effort to recover the network connection process. By limping through a connection process without enough planning and thought, it is almost guaranteed that this complex process will create a significant distraction for the development team. This distraction comes at a high cost for the project as higher value project streams may be neglected by the developer. Imagine if more time could be channelled into the EPC negotiation and contract management, where saving of a few % in EPC capex can often account for more than the total value of the network connection. Likewise focusing effort on reducing EPC risk or identifying efficiencies in EPC timeframes is where project resources are better focused. In contrast, achieving a small % in savings on the connection process, will deliver only a small fraction of a % in overall project savings and the time delays in achieving these savings could quickly swamp any savings. Executing the correct network connection strategy can often find savings or efficiencies in the network connection without compromising the greater project outcomes. 4. Land is cheap – Well, a lot cheaper than building transmission lines While a great price on a parcel of land for a development may seem too good to be true, the reality, as is often the case, it probably is. You wouldn’t believe the times I have heard from a developer their father’s, cousin’s, best mate’s sister has a paddock in the middle of nowhere that they have managed to get cheap land and so thought to themselves “I think I will plonk a renewable energy project here”. Great idea, but how far away is the network? You need a network to connect large scale generation. Often in Australia, great plots of land with good wind or solar resource are miles away from the network, and perhaps even further away from any network with decent capacity. Don’t get caught out by low cost land because building expensive transmission lines back to the network or local network reinforcements will quickly swamp any savings you might make on land acquisition. I should point out that by no means am I a land acquisition expert, however I’m aware the cost of rural land is a lot cheaper than transmission costs. Get a map of the NEM transmission lines and substations and find a spot as close to those assets as possible because projects requiring significant transmission line components have rarely been successful. But be careful because the transmission network will need to have suitable spare capacity and system strength at your proposed point of connection. Just because there is a transmission line running across your paddock doesn’t mean you have a cheap connection. I have seen developers having to ignore the nearby transmission line and build a multi km new transmission line to another part of the network where there is capacity. A surprise for the developer at the time which the network could have easily helped to identify with early engagement. 5. Negotiation of connection agreement terms. Remember when I said monopolies are a two-way street meaning the incumbent, monopoly NSPs also are forced to deal with the developers? It’s because of this fact that NSPs will often only accept terms in connection agreements which are heavily weighted in their favour. For this reason, it’s important not to die in the ditch over relatively minor commercial terms in connection agreements. Time and time again I saw developers arguing a commercial term on and off for months, that ultimately would have very little practical impact and a monopoly NSP would never have budged on anyway. Meanwhile, weeks or months have passed, and the connection of the project is delayed. In line with the 10/50 rule mentioned earlier, this is the low value area of your connection, so get on with it and don’t let this process drain the brain power and time of the development team. It is critical to work out what is worth negotiating, and what isn’t. NSPs might move on some things, and won’t move on others, period. It is sound practice to challenge unfavourable connection agreement terms, but it’s critical to understand what’s worth chasing and what isn’t. This might sound like simple negotiation 101, but it’s not always evident. And at the end of the day, while contractual terms proposed by the NSPs might not be ideal, there are very few connected assets that have been significantly impacted by unfavourable commercial terms. As I have hopefully made clear, new generator development in the NEM is extremely challenging and grid connections specifically are one of the more complex and risky project development areas. Successful developers are those that acknowledge the difficulties in successfully leading a network connection work stream and appoint specialised personnel with the required level of expertise to plan and execute a robust network connection strategy. This in turn frees up project development resources to deal with the other higher value/ higher risk development areas. Despite the difficulties associated with grid connections however, these simple and quick wins can be realised with some simple planning and thought. Considering these quick wins before and during the project development process will go a long way to achieving a successful network connection, and hopefully, a successful generation development. —————————– About our Guest Author Nathan Potter is a Senior Consultant at Clutch Consulting.

    "title": "AEMO forecasts new “lowest ever” demand today in South Australia – but misses by 200MW",
    "date": "26-10-2019 03:56:00 PM",
    "content": "It’s been a number of years through which AEMO forecasts have pointed out the fast-approaching situation where “grid demand”* might approach 0MW during the middle of particular sunny days in South Australia, so it should not be a surprise to see demand going “down, down, down” (to the tune of that irritating jingle). * Grid Energy is a general term we use to make it clear we are not thinking about supplies from embedded generation (especially rooftop solar). For the gory details of all the different measures of demand, see this earlier “Explainer about Electricity Demand” on WattClarity . I’ve been out of the office for the prior week so have been catching up on a couple things today, but (as always) with an eye on what’s happening today – captured in this snapshot from our NEMwatch v10 entry-level dashboard from a earlier today, showing solid output from wind and solar across the NEM, at least in part contributing to low levels of demand in both Victoria and South Australia: Now, I already posted this article here on 17th October noting that SA Scheduled Demand had dropped to a low-point of 490MW on 1st Sept 2019 (equal with the mysterious event back on 17th March 1999), and I thought it would be worth updating this NEMreview v7 trend, to show that the “lowest ever point” is now down at 416MW from “TOTAL DEMAND” (i.e. Scheduled Demand on a dispatch target basis) – being from 14:15 on 20th October, so a few days after my prior article: Out of interest, here’s Victoria also from NEMreview v7 : As noted, we’re still away from the lowest (non-zero*) level experienced in the Christmas-NewYear period of 2016-17 in the Victorian region. If any long-term NEM junkies can help us understand what happened in March 1999, that would be appreciated! However the most interesting thing to occur today was how low the AEMO was forecasting the TOTAL DEMAND to fall for the 12:30 trading period from the 10:30 predispatch run – shown here through the use of the “Forecast Convergence” Widget in ez2view : A 208MW difference may not sound like much to some, but it’s also 60% highe r than the AEMO had been forecasting only 2 hours earlier ! I’ve included this as an illustration of the challenges AEMO will increasingly face into the future . No time for any more today. Would like to delve more into why the actual was so much higher, maybe a reader can help?",

    "title": "Almost three years on – reflections on Frequency Control in the NEM",
    "date": "25-10-2019 07:47:00 AM",
    "content": "In January 2017 I wrote a paper that contained the reasons why the frequency control on the eastern seaboard was insufficient and poor . A summary article was published here on WattClarity on 23rd March 2017 , it included the following statement: “Reassessment of the approach to frequency control should be undertaken with a view to: · reintroducing narrow mandated deadbands across the NEM · removing regulatory disincentives to tight governor action.” The paper also included an explanation of why the current method relying on “regulation FCAS” was insufficient. After 32 months of numerous reviews, technical working groups, international expert engagement, another serious event (the double-islanding of 25th Aug 2018 ) and three rule changes in process the frequency control of the eastern seaboard remains extremely poor. Furthermore, the system is likely to remain poorly controlled for another summer period as rule the rule change process takes months. The 1 November 2015 event in SA illustrated similar lack of control ( the AEMO report is here ) while the FCAS markets raked up $65 Mil in local costs. In September 2018 at an Engineers Australia event on Ancillary Services and frequency control, one member in the audience asked the following question; “You spoke about this a year ago, why hasn’t it been fixed?” The question was answered by the AEMC, who politely explained that their FCAS Framework Review did not consider it an urgent problem. It was clear the engineers expected the problem to be fixed after 12 months, particularly when there are known practical solutions. The public utilities in each state once employed a small department (about 5-6 engineers) that specialised in system dynamics and control. The system control engineers would test, measure and analyse the control responses of each unit to ensure that they responded to step changes correctly. System control engineering was concerned with co-ordinating the response of all units to ensure that unit controls were working and the collective response of the system was adequate and coherent. The inefficiency, cost and risk to the power system of the market reviews over the last 32 months far outweigh the cost of the small dedicated teams of system control engineers that once tuned the units. The international expert report has recommended reintroducing appropriate dead bands on all units, removing control actions that defeat frequency sensitivity, and co-ordinating droop settings across the NEM. This is logical and necessary and does not contradict the recommendations I made 32 months ago. Even within the expert’s report I find two items that appear to be in incorrect when compared with actual local data. Electronically connected generation has been proven to not be sensitive to frequency as is claimed and operates across a wider frequency range than say a gas turbine. Furthermore, the power system is not “well controlled” when the frequency reaches the boundary of the normal operating band. The lack of control is illustrated every time a region separates, the inability to recover the frequency within a separated region is indicative of the lack of control. 25 th August in Queensland illustrated this – Figure 16 from the AEMO’s report (copied below) illustrates that the control systems no longer provide an appropriate response for partial load rejection, there is insufficient reduction in active power so the frequency remains high: (Reproduced from AEMO’s “Final Incident Report Queensland and South Australia system separation on 25 August 2018” ) The current market mechanisms force all error in active power into the frequency, with few understanding the consequences to efficiency or control. It is clear from the evidence that the market has enabled the detuning of the generators through the cumulative effect of a number of rule changes. This has taken the system from co-ordinated control to competition in control, a highly undesirable outcome on the power system. Over the years of reform, the rules have altered the power system control philosophy without appreciating the consequences. We see more rule changes and regulatory complexities being piled onto generators without addressing the fundamentals or understanding in full what the problem is that rules are trying to solve. The inability within the market to efficiently correct an identified technical control problem illustrates a fundamental design flaw and a significant loss in power system knowledge. Are we suffering a system tragedy? Every issue triggers a call for a new policy, new regulation, new “technical requirement” when the fundamentals have not been addressed. Each rule change seems to bring unintended outcomes, often increasing costs and reducing efficient operation. Or do we have blind faith in the “magic of the market place”, thinking that a market knows how to control the power system? We face another summer with the eastern seaboard at risk again with inadequate control of active power. —————————– About our Guest Author Kate is a specialist in power system control and technical regulation issues for the NEM and Renewable Energy in Australia.

    "title": "All aboard the Negawatt Express … but where are we really headed?",
    "date": "21-10-2019 02:35:00 PM",
    "content": "Readers might be aware that there’s a rule change process currently making its way through the AEMC relating to the the establishment of a “wholesale demand response mechanism” – which I would prefer to refer to as a “centralised Negawatt dispatch mechanism” to reduce confusion. The draft ruling made on 18th July 2019 (operations to commence on 1st July 2022 – i.e. a year following the commencement of 5 Minute Settlement) following deliberations over 3 different rule change proposals published in November 2018 . Submissions on that draft ruling closed almost 6 weeks ago (on Thursday 12th September) with the submssions linked on the AEMC webpage here . Two weeks later (on Thursday 26th September) the AEMC published this “Summary of stakeholder submissions to draft determination on wholesale demand response mechanism” . What I found of most interest, in reviewing the AEMC’s summary of stakeholder submissions, is that none of the comments really seem to capture the essence of our concern . In the AEMC’s summary of submissions, they note: “However, a few stakeholders considered that the benefits of introducing the mechanism set out under the draft rule would be outweighed by the associated costs.” … but my concerns are not about the cost/benefit, but more about whether we’re actually headed in the right direction in relation to the challenges we’re likely to face in future as this energy transition picks up speed. Readers should not read into the above that I’m criticizing AEMC for omitting something in their summary of the submissions (clearly as we did not make a submission, our views could not be included in this summary). My comment is more one of puzzlement: 1) wondering if we’re the only ones wondering whether turning right into NegaWatt land will actually make it harder to achieve a genuine two-sided market and hence ensure the energy transition can succeed; 2) which is, after all, what our primary objective should be (isn’t it?). So, given that submissions and closed and AEMC has written their summary – but also noting that the final rule change decision has not yet been made (deadline extended and currently due 5th December 2019 – 6 weeks away ), and that there are a sizeable number of AEMC staff (along with a broad range of others across the energy sector) who read WattClarity with interest, bear with me whilst I make a number of comments… (A) Background (A1) About Demand Response We need to start by re-stating that “demand response” is an umbrella term used to describe a broad range of arrangements under which energy users might temporarily reduce their consumption, in response to some incentive to do so . Who these energy users are, the manner in which they reduce their consumption, and the incentive provided to them, can take many different forms. We note in the AEMC documentation that they have also added in an additional quality into their definition (on the first page of their Summary in their Draft Ruling): ”It also implies a degree of transparency where consumers can signal to the rest of the market what they are intending to do” … and whilst we understand the value that such transparency delivers to the market, it’s important to understand that this is not something that has been established as an essential prerequisite in definitions of Demand Response used in the industry for decades. Unfortunately much of the discussion about demand response has historically not seemed to get past the starting gate, given that some stakeholders have come with pre-conceived notions that Demand Response does not currently exist in the NEM. This reality (and the unfortunate by-product that it was actually one of the real barriers we’ve encountered in continuing to grow the utilisation of demand response in the NEM) was one of the reasons that prompted us to invest in the creation of the information resource at www.DemandResponse.com.au , complete with this resource explaining some of the different approaches to demand response . These efforts (and those of others) have helped: (i) We particularly acknowledge the efforts of the AEMC in this current iteration of a rule change proposal for not repeating misleading statements made by others based on a narrower view of all that “demand response” encompasses (though note the caveat above about the limitation added by AEMC for perhaps laudable reasons – but which could inadvertently lead to that barrier continuing). (ii) However (as also noted back in 2015 ) it is clear to me that, whatever the outcome of this rule change request, it would promote clarity (and avoid unwanted confusion) if the AEMC chose to call this a “Negawatt Dispatch Mechanism” rather than using the current term “Demand Response Mechanism” – which is broader, and so potentially ambiguous (for example, see section C2 below). (A2) Our involvement with Demand Response Frequent readers will understand how we’ve played an active role of building the scale of Demand Response operating in the NEM since the start of the NEM: 1) We summarised some of our our own demand response journey here ; 2) Including the real barriers we’ve encountered in helping large energy users be more responsive to spot prices. Back in March 2019 (i.e. before the AEMC published its draft ruling) we posted these initial thoughts here about what we see as the route forward that will actually help deliver on this energy transition. Readers should note that there also was prior discussion accelerating changes underway in the NEM as part of this energy transition throughout our Generator Report Card 2018 , released on 31st May 2019 (with Theme 12, Theme 13 and Theme 14 in Part 2 containing discussions of particular relevance to this deliberation about Demand Response). (B) Glass half full, or half empty? There are definitely two different ways in which one might read the work done by the AEMC in this respect: (B1) It could have been worse… ( much worse) On the “glass half full” side, we’re definitely pleased (perhaps even pleasantly surprised?) to see that the AEMC appears to have taken onboard a number of the suggestions we made suggestions we made in March 2019 (and by others as well). Pleasant surprise #1) AEMC has knocked off many rough edges of what could have been much, much worse I understand that the political pressure to do something has been escalating in recent times (at least in part due to the evolving train wreck of a mismanaged energy transition ). Hence when viewed in a certain sort of a way, the AEMC has done a commendable job (under such overwhelming pressure to act) in knocking off a number of the (very) rough edges of some of the ideas circulating prior to the draft ruling being published: (a) In particular, the way the AEMC has proposed for retail volumes to continued to be settled on metered volumes is one step that would seem to (at least to the extent we understand) lower the information systems costs relating to this implementation. (b) Unfortunately to do this the AEMC has needed to wave their magic wand to conjure up the concept of a “reimbursement rate” with which to ensure retailers are made whole in the wholesale market. Hence two artificial measures (i.e. the Negawatt, and the Reimbursement Rate) are combined in a necessary step to try to reduce the imbalances caused by the introduction of the first artificial measure (the Negawatt). What could go wrong there, we wonder? It’s no surprise that retailers are looking at that particular aspect of the draft ruling very closely… For logical reasons, the AEMC has also proposed that the method be first available to larger energy users. This will enable a period of review to ensure that the program is actually delivering on the benefits that are assumed to flow as part of the rationale for the change (however we note – as below – that this review has not been facilitated in the rule that has been proposed). Pleasant surprise #2) AEMC has also clearly picked up on a number of our other suggestions Whilst “knocking off rough edges” was certainly part of the thrust of our comments back in March 2019 , we also included a number of other suggestions that would (in our view – formed by 15+ years of actually making demand response work in the NEM) go a long way to broadening the scope of demand response activities. For instance, we provided suggestions for the enhancement of Energy-Made-Easy , which the AEMC has copied through into its draft determination (see page 66 in the main body, with also further discussion in Appendix H – Other Changes (see H2.2 from p174)). (B2) … but is is really the best we can do? On the “glass half empty” side, however, we wonder whether “could have been worse” is really an appropriate performance standard for an area of reform that will need to deliver much more to deal with the challenges of the future ? A bit like the end-of-year-report for the wayward kid in school who we seem to accept is never going to amount for much – except that this is an essential service that is being called upon to fundamentally reshape to eliminate carbon in a very short space in time (relative to the challenge). We’re counting on little Johnny NEM to deliver us big things in future , so I know I would be more comfortable if the report card said more than “could have been worse”. In our comments back in March 2019 , we (hopefully) made it clear that achieving a genuinely 2-sided market was essential to making this energy transition succeed. In our Generator Report Card , through various themes in Part 2, we provided some of the background to why the NEM is evolving to the point whereby this will be essential – and in a relatively short space of time. The AEMC acknowledges this in its draft determination in several places (in the Executive Summary, and then ) – but then seems to almost skirt around this fact and propose the implementation of a Negawatt Dispatch mechanism in a way that (in our view) will make it all the more difficult to actually progress to a 2-sided market ! Here are some examples: Statements from the AEMC Our comments In the Executive Summary, the AEMC writes (point 19): “The mechanism will eventually be outgrown because it provides consumers with opportunities to substitute for generation. This will not be sustainable in the long-run as more consumers seek to engage. “ That the mechanism that’s proposed is not scalable, or sustainable was a point that we made in our comments back in March 2019 ! …. however the AEMC does not appear to have understood what we see as the implications of implementing a mechanism that’s not scalable or sustainable, especially as there appears to be no pathway provided in the rule changes envisaged to get where we actually need to go. It’s easy to foresee a future point in time (which is likely to be closer than many think) where the AEMC will need to ‘unmake’ this rule in the change-over. Imagine the shit-fight (that’s the technical term?) that will come from the Demand Response Service Providers whose very business viability could well be at stake with their revenue source (payment for negawatts) were to be removed in the move to a 2-sided market arrangement that is actually scalable and sustainable. Given that this is the case, we would expect that (if the AEMC wanted to implement a Negawatt mechanism as an interim arrangement) at the very least they should provide an explicit pathway in these same rule changes. This might include: 1) That it clearly be noted as “interim” in the rule; 2) That any DRSP entering into arrangements with energy users for the provision of negawatts explicitly acknowledge that the arrangement is interim (in order that no-one can claim “I was not told”); 3) That the rule changes proposed now also explicitly include some form of sunset clause – which might be of a number of forms, perhaps: (a) An explicit review date in the rule, to see if it is still valid; or (b) A requirement that any NMI registering to provide Negawatts must transition to be a fully scheduled load within some period (5 years perhaps?); or (c) Some explicit criteria (e.g. in terms of market developments) that would trigger the removal of the Negawatt Mechanism in the move to something truly sustainable and scalable. In our comments back in March 2019 we likened this to turning right at an intersection (towards what we see as a very rocky road) whereas where we really need to head is leftwards, towards a genuine two-sided market ! In the Executive Summary, the AEMC writes (point 20): “However, it is impossible to exactly know this counterfactual level of electricity consumption. If the baseline is set too high, consumers will pay more than they need to. If it is too low, then there won’t be enough incentive to encourage demand response in the market. The draft rule seeks to minimise these consequences. Moving to a two-sided market in the longrun means that there would be no need to determine these artificial benchmarks” The inherent challenges in searching for that ‘Goldilocks baseline’ was another of the points we made in our comments back in March 2019 (as have many others) …. …. clearly the challenge of baselines is one of the unavoidable (and ultimately impossible – certainly not scalable!) challenges inherent in the encouragement of any kind of Negawatt-centred form of Demand Response, no matter whether: 1) Centrally determined and administered by the AEMO, as contemplated in this rule; or 2) Decentrally determined and administered (e.g. by retailers), as has been the case to date. Readers are reminded that these are not the only ways of delivering demand response, however! We take particular notice that the AEMC says “The draft rule seeks to minimise these consequences” and we provide additional suggestions below (see the table in section D)) that, we believe, should be implemented in conjunction with this rule change to provide additional capability for the energy sector to manage the risks inherent in the centralised support for the use of Negawatts (and hence baselines). In the Executive Summary, the AEMC writes (point 22): “The Commission considers the process of developing a two-sided market and the associated transition path should start . “ and then (from p41): “In the longer term, the Commission considers that the active role of the demand side in the wholesale market will need to be much more prominent. The demand side will play an integral role in the future of the NEM. It is therefore critical to continue to consider the reform trajectory that will lead to the development of a two-sided market . This is discussed further below “ We certainly welcome this perspective, and the discussion (p42-43) from the AEMC… …. however (unless we missed it), we cannot find a single initiative contained in this rule change that either: 1) provides for that process of developing a two-sided market to start; or 2) (as noted above in this table) provides a real pathway from what the Negawatt Mechanism the AEMC is proposing to implement now, and where we actually need to be. As noted above, in the absence of this pathway, what the AEMC is doing now will unfortunately & inevitably become a real barrier. As discussed below (anecdote C3) I have not seen a single advocate for the Negawatt Mechanism, in the weeks following the publication of the draft rule (noting that some have been very vocal in various mainstream media outlets) acknowledging that what the AEMC has proposed: 1) Is not scalable 2) Is not sustainable; and 3) Will need to be replaced with a real 2-sided market in the fast approaching future. The AEMC has a golden chance, in progressing from this draft rule to a more workable final rule, to prevent that looming bun-fight ahead, by making sure that everyone’s eyes are focused on where we really need to go… The AEMC notes that (in p39): “Demand side participation should also assist with managing the ‘duck curve’ to the extent that the wholesale price is able to reflect the value of electricity during solar troughs and as the solar output declines and operational demand ramps up.” however …. …. the AEMC does not appear to acknowledge that any Negawatt Mechanism cannot (by their very nature) properly address the challenges inherent in the ‘duck curve’ for a number of reasons, including: 1) That negawatts are based on reductions from a pre-determined baseline, and so inherently cannot deal with increases from that baseline (such as in the case of negative prices); and 2) The fundamental nature of the ‘duck curve’ (i.e. occurring frequently, but with some variability) make it less likely a workable baseline can be established if the load is responding either to either: (a) to perceived (though perhaps often illusory) benefits of consuming more when the grid’s emissions intensity is relatively low; or (b) to the negative price effects that many expect will occur more frequently during sunny days in shoulder seasons as the energy transition ramps up. The AEMC notes that (in p43): “…the nature of baselines mean that very regular participation in the wholesale market will not be enabled under the mechanism. “ Say what?! In short-hand, we’re on the path to create a mechanism that is, ostensibly, about helping energy users to be more responsive to supply/demand balance as revealed through spot prices – however if those same energy users are too responsive, then that same very mechanism we’re proposing to implement breaks down and does not work . Got that? The paragraph continues, by explaining: “A baseline uses historical consumption (from when demand response was not provided) to determine a counterfactual level of consumption as if the consumer was not responding to the wholesale price. Therefore, if a consumer were to respond to the wholesale price every day, there would be no reasonable grounds on which a counterfactual could be determined. However, moving to a two-sided market in the long-run…” Now, we understand very well what the AEMC is saying – in that the scope of demand response (as envisaged in this Negawatt Mechanism) is much more restricted than some energy users, and their advisors, might wish for it to be. After all, it was one of the reasons given back in March 2019 about why a mechanism like envisaged in the draft rule will not be scalable and sustainable. However (see anecdote C1 below) it’s become quite apparent to us, following conversations with our existing energy user clients and others, that they do not understand. On top of the bun-fight looming when we reach the inevitable point where we need to unwind this interim arrangement and proceed to a proper 2-sided market, I also foresee we’re going to end up with a significant case of buyer’s remorse amongst another group of energy users who will react negatively to the revelation that they’ve been sold (in their case) a dud, in the case of a Negawatt Mechanism. This buyers remorse could well end up being one more barrier to achieving real flexibility on behalf of the demand side – which we are surely going to need in this energy transition. To sum up our perspective, our view remains that the mechanism that is proposed is neither scalable or sustainable – nor does it address the underlying challenges that are fast approaching us with this energy transition. Instead, it seems intent to implement something designed to solve yesterday’s perceived problems, but at the same time create significant barriers to where we really need to go. (C) Confusion abounds about what’s actually proposed Unless I am mistaken in reading the substance of what is proposed, it also seems to me that confusion abounds about what is actually proposed. Perhaps three anecdotes would be useful to illustrate this situation: Anecdote C1) Double-dipping As noted above, we have a number of large energy users as clients – where they take some form of spot exposure and use our software to help manage the risks (and secure the benefits) related to this. One of those clients had a conversation with us a few weeks back about their understanding that this new mechanism would enable them to gain more value from the – not understanding the AEMC’s caveat that (ironically) these types of energy users, who are already quite active, would be excluded from participation. How many others are out there believing mistakenly the general pronouncements by advocates that this will be a bonus for them?! Anecdote C2) No solution to negative prices As noted on WattClarity and elsewhere in recent times, we have seen a spate of negative prices in the NEM . It’s an entirely logical thing that energy users would be looking to move consumption to those times, to take advantage of those over supplies of cheaper generation. I found it a little bizarre that a number of comments have been made by various stakeholders (including some working at prominent Negawatt advocates!) which implied that the new ruling would help to create a “solar sponge” to utilise these periods of surplus generation. As noted above, this will not be the case – but what concerns me is that some quite prominent advocates for the ruling apparently do not realise this. Again, what does this mean for “buyers remorse” when energy users find out that what they believed to be true is not possible? Anecdote C3) No mention of sustainability or scalability In our comments posted in March 2019 , we made the point that what was being proposed (in the form of ‘creating’ Negawatts as supply-side options in dispatch) was neither a scalable or sustainable solution. In the AEMC’s draft determination, it seems that they agreed with this, but have decided to: 1) Propose the creation of the mechanism anyway; but sadly 2) Not with any explicit provision in the rule for a pathway to a genuinely 2-sided market. Instead, in the media talk-fest that has followed on from the release of the draft ruling, the consistent message coming out from the advocates has seemed to be that this will be “the” solution to our energy transition challenges. No mention has been made (to my knowledge) of concerns we raised, as echoed by the AEMC, that it is neither scalable nor sustainable. Hence this seems to reinforce our other related concern – that unmaking this rule at a future point in time to enable us to go where we need to be headed in the first place is going to be all the more difficult as a result. (D) AEMC assessment framework In the AEMC’s draft rule determination (from section 4.2 on p45) the AEMC outlines the way in which it assesses rule changes proposed (and alternate ‘preferable rules’, such as what it has drafted here). Of particular interest to me were the 7 different principles it has adopted for evaluating rule changes (section 4.3 on page 48). Given that the AEMC has stated these as the principles/criteria used to assess rule changes, I thought it would be helpful to add in the following thoughts on some of the 7 principles: Principles listed (page 48) Thoughts with respect to each principle Principle 1/7 = Promoting Competition and Consumer Choice Noting to add here. Principle 2/7 = Resilience of framework In the AEMC’s document (p49), they write: “Regulatory arrangements must be flexible to changing market conditions. They should not be implemented to address issues specific to a particular time period or jurisdiction, or the prevailing technology or business model of the day. Regulatory frameworks should support the right mix of resources over time, encompassing technological developments and changes in consumer behaviour. ” We wholeheartedly support “resilience” as a guiding principle, and appreciate the AEMC stating this explicitly. However that’s what makes us all the more surprised to see that: Step 1) The AEMC is proposing to implement a Rule Change that they themselves acknowledge is not scalable or sustainable, and will need to be replaced in future years; and yet Step 2) At least to my reading, the proposed Rule does not take the principle of resilience into consideration – which it would do if it included explicit consideration of a sunset date on the rule, or some some form of review process baked in from Day #1. Instead (as noted above) we would expect to see an almighty bunfight on that future day as AEMC recognises the need Principle 3/7 = Not distorting efficient market outcomes Noting to add here. Principle 4/7 = Reliability and transparency In the AEMC’s document (p50), they write: “To provide more information to the rest of the market, wholesale demand response should be provided in a way that is transparent to the rest of the market.” Once again, we wholeheartedly agree. 1) One of the largest shortcomings of the form of demand response we have been helping to facilitate – spot exposed energy users – is that the action is not transparent to the market (we have noted this numerous times). 2) However, in our view, the rule drafted by the AEMC might not be making the situation better, but instead might actually be making the opacity worse ! In the AEMC’s document (p51-52), goes on to say: “By participating transparently, DRSPs will also contribute to the ability of other market participants to make informed operational decisions, since participants will be able to incorporate information about wholesale demand response participating through the mechanism into their operational and investment decisions” Readers can think of it this way – to understand the nature of a triangle , one must understand the length of all three sides (or two sides and one angle). In other words, three data points . It’s the same with understanding the validity and value of Negawatts dispatched into the market, an analyst would need to understand the three different data points : Data Point 1 = the actual metered demand (the only thing that can be ‘known’) Data Point 2 = the counter-factual demand assumed as the basis for the baseline using the baseline methodology; and Data Point 3 = the NegaWatt ‘dispatched’ as the supply-side option, … just like the three dimensions of a triangle. Instead, my reading is that there seems to be some (perhaps unintentional?) sleight-of-hand proposed here with data for only one side of the triangle to be published in the market data (i.e. the Negawatt supply-side contribution). It seems inevitable that there will be two outcomes from this: 1) it will give any third party zero ability to understand anything actually meaningful about the contribution of demand response: 1a) earlier this year we collaboratively invested approximately 10,000 hours in the preparation of a very widely read (and much appreciated) Generator Report Card analysing a wide range of performance: (i) We would have zero ability to perform useful analysis on the three sides of these new Negawatts, which seems to be a retrograde step (ii) Indeed, we already provides some discussion about the very nature of problems like this in Theme 14 within Part 2 of the Generator Report Card 2018 ! 1b) In the rules, AEMO is required to wear all four hats: (i) Defining the centralised baseline methodology; (ii) Having access to all three sides of the triangle, as they must do to effect dispatch (albeit solely!) (iii) Dispatching the negawatts; and (iv) Reviewing the effectiveness of the baseline methodology. Doesn’t anyone else see major potential problems looming in this approach? Without the three sides of the triangle all being accessible, no other party will be able to ascertain the true value, and the true validity of the negawatts we’ll all be paying for. 2) Instead, it seems, we’ll unfortunately be left to see some statistics of how many negawatts have been dispatched – which will devolve to a ‘vanity metric’ in the absence of the other two sides. To me this is especially surprising given that the AEMC has explicitly named ‘reliability and transparency’ as one of its cornerstone principles, and also because it devotes much attention (Appendix E) to the inherent challenges with landing on that ‘goldilocks baseline’ Principle 5/7 = Appropriate risk allocation Noting to add here. Principle 6/7 = Administrative and Implementation costs The AEMC notes (p50) that: “The Commission has assessed the implementation efficiency of the proposals set out in the rule change requests. This is necessary so that the implementation and ongoing costs, ultimately borne by consumers, do not exceed the benefits of introducing a mechanism.” As we have noted above, what the AEMC has proposed is much better than what might had been the case had some of the very rough edge been knocked off the initial proposal. Also as noted above, we wonder whether “could have been worse” is an acceptable performance standard we should be aspiring to, given the inherent challenges in the energy transition. Principle 7/7 = Appropriate customer protections The AEMC notes (p50) that: “A competitive retail market should be backed by a strong consumer protection framework for those that need it most.” Unless we are misunderstanding the proposed rule, the consumer protection framework seems to be one still left with the legacy retailer (i.e. not applying to the Demand Response Service Provider) – and so, in effect, this change would just be another case of ‘socialising cost whilst privatising benefit’. (E) Calling for Expressions of Interest in provision of “Negawatt Factories” Finally, it’s worth noting that (should this rule change go ahead) we might be seeking expressions of interest in the creation of “Negawatt Factories” for the NEM using a particular methodology that we have developed – patent pending* * only joking about the “patent pending” bit….. perhaps?",

That does not mean we’ve forgotten about NEMwatch , with designs developed for a major upgrade to NEMwatch v11 that we’ll roll onto at some point. It’s a product that’s still used across a diverse client base as an excellent entry-level dashboard to the NEM and (by virtue of this Email Alert which has triggered increasingly of late) has let us know of a dispatch interval where the “Scheduled Demand” has dropped below 500MW in the South Australian region. For the gory details of all the different definitions used for something that seems as simple as “Demand” please refer to this prior “Explainer about electricity demand” on WattClarity . Readers might also reflect on the proliferation of these measures in the light of comments we made in Theme 14 within Part 2 of our Generator Report Card 2018 . Curious to see how minimum demand levels have been trending, I quickly cranked up NEMreview v7 and produced this quick trend of minimum demand levels of three different measures of demand in South Australia: Whilst each measure of demand has its own merits, it is “Total Demand” I’m most interested in here as it is the same as what’s shown in NEMwatch , and also is the one that has the longest history accessible. With the exclusion of the SA System Black event, we see that today’s demand was down very close to the minimum demand experienced in South Australia over the 21 years that the NEM has been operational – with only Sept 2019, Dec 2018 and March 1999 experiencing lower monthly minimums. We’d expect to see these types of levels occur more frequently in future as the “duck curve” takes further hold… — Oh, and I will hope that one of the long-time NEM junkies might be able to help us out with a comment below about what happened way back on 17th March 1999 .

    "title": "Lessons learnt in bringing new wind and solar to commercial operations stage",
    "date": "16-10-2019 10:29:00 AM",
    "content": "‘Australia – a land of opportunity?’ It has been about 2 years since I moved to Melbourne from the UK to set up K2 Management ’s Australian office. Our move was well timed in that it coincided with the two highest investment years the industry has experienced to date. Since 2016, AUD$27b has been invested in new wind, solar and storage projects, equivalent to some 15GW [1] of new utility scale generation. However, as the bilaterally agreed renewable energy target (RET) has been met and not extended, many have begun to speculate on whether the level of investment will continue. Many infrastructure investors have a global remit. For example, at any given time, K2 Management may be supporting a single infrastructure investor to simultaneously acquire a portfolio of US wind farms, construct a solar farm in Australia and identify green field sites in Taiwan. So, what is it about the Australian market that has drawn so much interest in recent years and will it be sustained? By comparing my UK and more recent Australian experience, I thought I might offer some insights. ‘Seeking new horizons’ As I was leaving the UK in 2017, the government backed renewable obligation (RO) support mechanism was just ending. Similar schemes existed in many parts of western Europe. The benefit to wind and solar farm owners was designed to reduce over the 15 years of the scheme, reflecting the decrease in costs as the sector matured. But even as it closed, the scheme still provided ~40% of revenue for the first 20 operational years, underpinning the project financial model and helping to secure debt finance. The primary challenges for UK developers at that time were securing land and planning permission, without being subject to onerous conditions. For infrastructure funds seeking to buy shovel-ready projects, the risks lay in avoiding overly optimistic energy yield predictions and in some countries, determining the extent of grid curtailment as some network areas became congested. Then, around 2015, many European countries, including the UK, shifted from RO or feed-in-tariff schemes to limited volume reverse auctions. Development slowed and, in some countries, halted almost entirely. The trade-off for investors of a relatively de-risked sector, was intense competition for the limited number of available projects and far tighter margins leading to low single digit returns. The European offshore wind sector underwent a similar transition. Suddenly, overseas renewables markets, once considered too difficult, started to look more attractive. ‘Australian abundance’ There are many factors that make Australia uniquely suited for renewable deployment. The country is well known for its abundant solar resource but the ‘Roaring 40s’ also provide hub height windspeeds of >7m/s in many states, providing ideal conditions for wind as well as solar projects. Credit: https://www.globalwindatlas.info/ In relatively densely populated countries like France and the UK, derating or shutting down turbines to avoid the impact of noise and shadow-flicker on nearby residents is not uncommon, in some cases decreasing annual yield by several percent. Australia’s abundant land resource is doubly advantageous in that economies of scale can be achieved by developing large projects, without the need to de-rate to preserve residential amenity. Furthermore, larger, more efficient turbines can be installed because turbine hub heights generally aren’t restricted here as they have been onshore in the UK. Another key factor that makes Australia attractive to renewable investors is the value of the wholesale electricity market. The table below, comparing the supply capacity and value of the UK and Australian wholesale markets, indicates the size of the opportunity for generation asset owners. Metric Australia GB Supply capacity 54 GW 103 GW Market value $16.6bn $6.1bn Table comparing market sizes and value (courtesy of https://www.cornwall-insight.com) . If we also consider the expected decommissioning rate of aging coal plants in the coming years and State-led renewable electricity targets, it is little surprise that investors from Europe, US, China and Japan have all turned their attention to the Australian market. Region VIC QLD TAS SA NEM in 2018 Renewable contribution 40% by 2025 50% by 2030 100% by 2022 100% by 2030 ~20% Table showing renewable penetration targets by State and current penetration in the NEM. ‘Challenges unique to Australia’ Despite the many advantages it offers, as with every market, Australia has its challenges. In supporting developers and investors to initiate, construct and operate approximately 8GW of wind solar and storage projects in Australia, K2 Management has had first-hand experience of the risks faced by our clients. Marginal Loss Factors (MLFs), grid connection costs, grid code compliance, commissioning delays, securing offtake and various other technical risks all need to be addressed by investors seeking acceptable returns on renewable energy assets in this market. ‘Getting connected’ Described by some global investors as the toughest grid regime they’ve experienced, getting renewable energy projects connected is currently an onerous and uncertain process. The energy transition has produced a number of well documented issues such as annual MLF changes and the opaque grid connection process. Other recent headlines such as the imposition of export constraint on operational solar farms on the border of Victoria and New South Wales raise additional questions.

Marginal Loss Factors (MLF) reflect power lost in transporting energy from the point of generation to the point of consumption and are recalculated annually. The draft Marginal Loss Factors report was published shortly before the federal election and arguably caused greater industry frustration than the Federal Coalition’s lack of climate change policy. Seemingly unpredictable variations of as much as 20% from year to year, are unique to the Australian market and constitute a material risk to project owners. Similarly, the introduction of new modelling requirements by AEMO earlier this year combined with the volume of applications, has made getting a connection offer far more costly and time-consuming. There are numerous developers who have secured land and development approval, shortlisted component suppliers and agreed an EPC contract price, only to have to projects stall for up to 6 months while they await the findings of Final Impact Assessments (FIAs). Simply put, FIAs are required for most new large-scale projects to predict how the network may be affected under a range of operational scenarios. The model inputs include, amongst other things, the technical characteristics of the wind turbine or solar farm inverter and an up to date simulation of the network. With inverters and wind turbine controllers constantly evolving, OEM technical teams often being based in Europe, the grid constantly changing as new generators connect and a current shortage of skilled resource to run the modelling, delays of up to 6 months are commonplace. Unfortunately, that’s enough time to lose a pre-agreed module price and manufacturing slot, which then requires another round of EPC price negotiation and may require a reworking of the whole project financial model. Similarly, if the FIA calls for a synchronous condenser or other auxiliary equipment, the project financials may be fundamentally altered. In other global markets such network infrastructure costs are often shared amongst all project beneficiaries or recouped later by the NSP, but in Australia they are typically borne by a single generator. ‘Securing an off-taker’ While grid issues seemingly remain the biggest impediment to the transition to renewables in Australia, developers and investors face other hurdles. Signing up a corporate off-taker is essential to securing traditional project finance but with more projects than off-takers, tenders are often competitive, forcing downward pricing pressure. In addition, getting the first corporate power purchase agreements (cPPA) has been slow and involved, as legal, commercial and contractual norms were established. Having undergone a lot of learning in recent years however, Australia is now seen as a world leader in this area. The volume of generation underpinned by cPPAs here is greater than in many other global markets and, as other regions seek to adopt the cPPA model in their journey to subsidy-free renewables, they look to Australia for inspiration. The main drivers of corporate power purchase agreements (cPPAs) are often the need to reduce exposure to high, volatile energy prices and to achieve Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) goals. Despite the addition of many GWs of renewable energy to the grid in recent years, capacity shortfalls at peak demand periods are expected to continue as coal generation is taken offline. Continued strong demand for cPPAs is therefore expected by corporates seeking to hedge against exposure to National Electricity Market (NEM) wholesale market prices. See K2M’s recent report for a global perspective on the emergence of cPPAs. ‘Technical considerations’ Several technical risks have also arisen at various wind and solar construction projects in recent years. To explain how these have materialised, it is worth considering that in 2016, Australia had only a handful of utility scale solar farms. Soon, 9GW [1] of utility scale solar capacity will have been connected. The solar industry, in particular, has undergone considerable learning in that time. In Queensland, EPC costs on some projects spiralled when unexpectedly tough ground conditions required thousands of piles to be pre-drilled rather than driven. As well as impacting costs, such incidents cause delays while designs are amended and agreed, variations negotiated, and drilling equipment sourced. Driving piles at an Australian solar farm Adverse weather conditions have also impacted project schedules. In some cases, tropical storms and rain have caused delays to solar farm installation. Extreme heat has also required EPC contractors to seek local council approval to install at night. If night working was not anticipated, retrospective approval must be sought as working hours are often limited to preserve resident’s amenity. Wind projects have also suffered installation delays as cranes are inoperable in high wind conditions. Recent phenomenal growth in wind and solar deployment has attracted many new domestic and overseas entrants to the Australian EPC market, driving competition for solar construction contracts in particular. As well as getting value for money, project owners want assurance that the shortlisted contractor has the financial strength, experience and local capability to deliver the project. In undertaking project due diligence, it is not enough just to ensure that risk is appropriately allocated between Principal and Contractor and that liquidated damages caps are adequately sized. Extensive additional checks are needed to ensure the EPC contractor is sufficiently experienced to anticipate project risks and that they are fully priced in the offer. Successful projects are usually delivered by experienced teams comprising personnel from the developer and EPC contractor, often combined with a strong owner’s engineer to manage risks and ensure the project technical specification is met. ‘Equipment bankability’ Another factor of the Australian market is the deployment of new technology. Wind developers seek to increase returns by installing larger rotor turbines at ever higher hub heights. Similarly, new inverter, tracker and module suppliers have flocked to Australia with the aim of winning large solar contracts. Lenders and investors quite reasonably want to know whether new inverters and turbines can pass AEMO’s stringent compliance testing, that tracker systems are designed for the expected wind and soil conditions and whether double glass bifacial modules will achieve predicted yields and degradation rates. Credit: https://soltec.com/ (Image of a bifacial solar project) In recent years some investors have suffered from wind farms not achieving their predicted energy yields. In some cases, the cause can be identified and rectified, such as incorrect controller or instrumentation set up. In other instances, recovering overpredicted turbine performance is not possible. This has been the case on projects where layouts, originally approved prior to the 2012-16 hiatus and therefore intended for smaller turbines, are now being built out with contemporary larger rotor machines. Tightly packed layouts can compromise turbine performance, leading to reduced energy yield. Energy yield prediction of Australian solar projects requires similar careful consideration given their unique combination of size, climatic conditions and cutting-edge technology. Consultancies like K2 Management rely on performance data from operational wind and solar projects to inform and validate preconstruction energy yield prediction methodology. Image showing neighbouring wind turbine effects ‘Challenges and opportunities’ Undoubtedly Australia presents investors with a unique set of challenges that, when considered alongside the current lack of federal policy, are unsurprisingly leading some to assess their regional strategies. However, in the absence of federal support, States are taking the necessary steps to meet their own energy needs and therefore growth in renewables in Australia seems set to continue. The industry has suffered some setbacks in recent years, but it has also learned some valuable lessons. A number of factors including high electricity pricing, abundant resource, large project sizes and cost efficiencies mean Australian renewable projects can achieve double the returns available in other markets. While clear federal policy would undoubtedly lend greater certainty, none the less, Australia offers well advised investors attractive opportunities and is likely to remain a strong investment market for the foreseeable future.

    "date": "14-10-2019 08:18:00 AM",
    "content": "For NEM junkies like us, more recently it seems that every day presents its own complexities and nuances that (given the type of company we are) we are always seeking to understand. (a) Earlier this year we completed saw the culmination of investment in the mammoth research project that became the Generator Report Card 2018 , a review of 20 years of performance of all types of generators in the NEM. Note that we’re contemplating following this up with a Generator Statistical Digest 2019 . (b) Since that time, as we have sought to embed the insights we gained through that process into our software products, we’ve found ourselves preparing an increasing number of Case Studies of interesting events in the NEM for internal consumption. We do this for several reasons – including to test our products by asking “how clearly does our software help us understand what’s happening, and why?” question. I’d like to share one Case Study with this broader audience today – but I would ask your understanding, as I recognise that (in trying to address two different audiences through this single article) I might end up not being as clear with either audience as I might otherwise be. There at least two reasons why I am posting this article today: Audience #1 WattClarity Readers – who appreciate the insights freely shared on this information site Audience #2 Users of our ez2view software application – who seek to use the software to produce their own insights As posted at the end of August, this year has seen a remarkable increase in the incidence of negative prices in the Queensland region . That article was followed by: 1) These four questions ; and 2) Some considerations about ‘who’s responsible’ for the negative prices from guest author Allan O’Neil; and 3) Allan’s follow-up explanation of why its plausible that some generators might end up in a position where there is a commercial benefit from having to pay AEMO to generate on the spot market (i.e. because of contract cover that they find themselves with).That last article was posted on 6th September (i.e. over 5 weeks ago).Since that time, the pattern of negative prices has continued , though perhaps not as strongly.Thursday last week (10th October) was a day in which the trading price was below zero for a number of hours, as shown in this trend from NEMreview v7 (a sub-set of the functionality also in ez2view): As with most images on WattClarity, click on the image for a full-screen view! As noted on the image, other days in the past week saw significant curtailment of production because of the ‘crunch’ flagged here previously . How that is unfolding is food for a follow-on article at some point later… (and unit level data would be visible in the Generator Statistical Digest 2019 , should we make the choice to develop this). Our ez2view software (which some have described as ‘ NEMwatch on steroids’) is the higher-end dashboard we provide that is used by a growing number of clients who have real financial exposure to the NEM in some way – such as by being a registered Scheduled or Semi-Scheduled Generator operating in the market. It’s software that’s unashamedly focused on the physical market – focused on providing answers to questions like ‘why did that happen?’ Given the growing number of new entrants coming onboard (i.e. associated with Wind Farms, Solar Farms and Batteries) we’re investing an increasing proportion of our time in ensuring that the software meets the particular needs of these new entrants. Because of this, we’re focusing many (but not all) of our Case Studies on the operations of these kinds of plant . As an outcome of the rapid/iterative development principles we’re operating under, we are producing several new ‘Bleeding Edge’ versions of the ez2view software every week. That’s too frequently for our clients to stay on top of – meaning that most clients are not using the very latest versions (in fact, a number of them are still back running the ‘Stable Release’ from May 2018 – so missing out on much new functionality). In the coming months as this process continues, we might look to post some case studies here using what’s the current version of the software at the time, as one part of a process of ensuring our clients can remain aware of some of the new functionality we’re working on and so provide their input into the development path. We’re looking forward to further interactions with our ez2view clients on the materials presented below from the current ‘bleeding edge’ version of the software – focused solely on the new “Unit Dashboard Widget” that is under intensive development. Clients should remember that this is just one of 1,000s of widgets available in the software (indeed, users have the ability to create their own using the Trends Engine), so some of the inferences drawn into the material below are based on other widgets not shown in this article. With the above two (overlapping, but also distinctive) audiences in mind, let’s start with the substance of the case study… (A) Animation In this case study, we look at a 13-hour period (i.e. 06:00-19:00) spanning the daylight hours of Thursday 10th October, and look specifically at the Ross River Solar Farm (chosen as it was one that jumped out in review of the event on Friday last week, for reasons that are expanded on below). Keep in mind that the reason why we focus on this solar farm is because it helps us explore some of the aspects of market operations that we’re striving to make more clear through this particular widget ( not because of any ulterior motive, so readers prone to conspiracy theories please keep that in mind) . We’ll start with the following animation that walks through all 157 dispatch intervals in the period in order to give readers an overview of how busy the day was at this particular Solar Farm: Some of this we understand – but note that some of what happened with the solar farm puzzles us, so we’re seeking assistance from those who can help us to better understand a number of aspects of what went on ( particularly trying to understand the ‘why?’ quest ion). (B) Questions we’d like help with, please? If you can help us understand any of the following questions, could I ask that you contact us: (a) You can always call us on +61 7 3368 4064 ; (b) Alternatively please feel free to contact us via this feedback form ; (c) Either way, if you are planning to be at All Energy next week in Melbourne please let me know, as that might be a good place and time to meet? We’ll look forward to hearing back from some of our readers and/or ez2view users about a number of things that are not quite as clear as we’d like them to be in the animation above. As noted in the animation: (B1) What happened with ASEFS and the apparently near Non-Conformance? As noted through the animation there were two separate periods where it appears that Ross River Solar Farm experienced three consecutive large Aggregate Dispatch Errors that, we understand, would translate to ‘Large Trigger Errors’ (as defined by AEMO) and hence mean the imminent declaration of Non-Conforming. (B1a) Period 1 (being 08:05, 08:10 and 08:15 dispatch intervals) The last of these dispatch intervals was 08:15 as shown here: In this dispatch intervals, we see that the ASEFS availability was suggesting that the plant could produce to 96MW output, and so the plant was given a target of 88MW at the time (with its volume offered down at –$1,000/MWh, which was the same as the CPD Price* at the time). However the unit actually reduced its output – from 44MW to 34MW at this point in time. * CPD Price is ‘Connection Point Dispatch’ Price = the name we currently use to describe the constraint-adjusted price at the RRN for this DUID (so like a nodal price , except without taking into account the marginal loss factor translating a price at the RRN to at the node). We wonder whether there was something awry with ASEFS at the time, in terms of it overestimating the capability of the plant at the time, or is there another reasons why the plant was so far under its target? (B1b) Period 2 (08:25, 08:30 and 08:40 dispatch intervals) With a 5-minute break (in which the ASEFS availability forecast dropped to equal the target/actual), a similar thing happened again for another stretch of three dispatch intervals – as shown here 08:35, the third of the run: In this case we see that the ASEFS Availability forecast had firstly jumped high but then dropped backwards again – however in all three dispatch intervals we see that the apparent Off-Target above the ‘Large Trigger Error’. (B2) Understanding the AER’s current Rebidding Guidelines The AER’s current Rebidding Guidelines are explained in our WattClarity Glossary here – including how we have previously used the 2017 Guidelines in categorizing rebids to 31st Dec 2018 as ‘Not Well Formed (Strict)’ as one part of the analysis for our Generator Report Card 2018 (and which we might extend further in the Generator Statistical Digest 2019 , if we decide to start that) In our animation above, we note how the rebids seen through this day for Ross River Solar Farm would also fall into the same category as ‘Not Well Formed (Strict)’ because of both: (a) Use of the tilde as a separator (i.e. the ’~’), instead of simply just the space as requested by the AER (we discussed in the Generator Report Card how this was a common shortcoming identified in many bids, suggesting a standard feature in third party software – albeit one that’s not strictly adherent with AER guidelines); and (b) Use of a colon to separate HH from MM in the time field. Leaving this to one side (as it is still possible to tweak an algorithm to accept a looser interpretation of the AER guidelines – hence the ‘Well Formed (Loose)’ definition ) what’s of more interest is the fact that the the rebid reasons did not change for all 20 rebids through the day, as seen in a focused version of the ‘Bids and Offers’ Widget in ez2view : As noted in the animation on several occasions when this happened, from a practical purpose it made the rebid reason not very useful for me interpreting the reasoning behind all the changes in bids across the day… We wonder if the ‘ABS’ acronym is supposed to stand for ‘automated bidding system’ (of which there are several operating in the NEM) and wonder, more generally, how this move to automation will help with the AER’s requirement that the description “is a verifiable description of the events or occurrences that explain the rebid. “ Perhaps some of our readers can help here? (B3) What was the intention with some of the rebidding? Firstly we need to remember that it’s impossible to know what a participants motivations are for how they operate in the market (any market) – though it does not help other stakeholders having valid reasons for wanting to have a guess . As such, it is essential for us to provide a means by which licensed users of ez2view can try to do this themselves with our software. Falling into the same role myself, I’ve tried (in the animation above) to piece together some possible reasoning for why each of the 20 rebids was made through the day – making particular note of whether what’s visible to me helps me come up with a plausible explanation or (in some cases) leaves me a bit mystified of what the purpose was . I’m particularly interested in help from those who can fill in the dispatch intervals where I have marked a “NO” under the “Do we think we understand why?” question. First Dispatch Interval of Effect Do we think we understand why? Comments on the particular rebid Do we think it was effective? 7:15 YES The 1st rebid for the day happens (we presume) because they want to avoid being dispatched at negative price . As noted in the image below, this shifts their volume up to a bid band well away from the dispatch price for that dispatch interval and hence their target is wound down to 0MW and they are offloaded: It seems that this has met their objectives. YES 7:20 NO The 2nd rebid is the next dispatch interval, and moves volume further away from the RRP (which is down at –$1,000/MWh): It’s not immediately clear what this was intended to achieve (and cannot be seen to have had any effect on dispatch outcomes). NO 7:30 NO The 3rd rebid for the day (and one at the end of this trading period) we see the volume move further away from the regional reference price – all the way to $14,500/MWh: Again it’s not immediately clear what this was intended to achieve (especially as it was only volume for that dispatch interval which was shifted). It certainly did not affect the dispatch outcomes. NO 7:35 YES The 4th rebid for the day is the first in the new trading period, and needs to be seen in conjunction with what the bid band would have been if the rebid had been made – which was –$1,000/MWh and not the bid band used for the 07:30 dispatch interval : Note however that this is only the case because of the way in which the generator had only rebid volume for the 07:30 trading period in the rebid immediately beforehand (which is an approach I’ve not seen too many other generator use): In this case, the rebid makes sense to me. YES 7:40 MAYBE? The 5th rebid for the day (immediately after) we see the volume shifted up closer to $0/MWh (to –$25.01/MWh): In the animation we wonder about the logic behind this move, but perhaps the generator was concerned the price might move up closer to their –$100/MWh bid band (hence requiring dispatch at negative price). Why the move only to –$25.01/MWh if this was the case is not clear to us… We do certainly know that it had no effect on the dispatch outcome. NO 7:50 NO Skipping 07:45 we move to 07:50 and the 6th rebid for the day: As noted in the animation, it’s not clear why this was done – and it’s certainly clear that it had no effect. NO 7:55 NO Next dispatch interval we have the 7th rebid for the day: As noted in the animation, it’s not clear why this was done – and it’s certainly clear that it had no effect. NO 8:45 YES … or MAYBE? The 8th rebid for the day happens 50 minutes later, and (it seems) clearly in response to the dispatch price plunging to –$290.25/MWh in the 08:40 dispatch interval: As a result, the generator shifts volume away from –$1,000/MWh to be dispatched down. We do have a question, though – why not rebid to a high positive price at this time? YES 8:55 NO … or MAYBE? After a rest of 1 dispatch interval, the 9th rebid for the day comes for the 08:55 dispatch interval: In this case volume is shifted higher ( maybe on concern that the price would rise above –$196.16, with a rise of 66c/MWh shown in P5 predispatch) – but perhaps this only needs to happen as the same approach was not taken in the rebid for 08:45? In any event, because of the what happens external to RRSF1 the change in bids has no effect. NO 09:00 NO … or MAYBE? Immediately after (for the last Dispatch Interval in the 09:00 trading period) the 10th rebid for the day occurs: This is shifting volume further away from the point of dispatch – but note that (as also seen in ‘Forecast Convergence’ widget ) the forecast dispatch price for 09:00 at 08:53 (when this rebid was submitted) was down at –$1000.00 so one does question the need to shift capacity higher st ill: NO 09:05 YES At this point, we’re only half-way through the rebids for the day. The 11th rebid for the day saw volume actually shift from the –$1,000/MWh (where it would have been in this new trading period had the rebid not been made) to be –$100/MWh: This results in the plant avoiding dispatch with the dispatch price down at –$980.54, which we presume is what they wanted. However it is worth noting that this additional rebid was only necessary because the prior rebid only moved volume for 09:00 (again, an approach we have not seen as common). YES 09:10 NO … or MAYBE? The 12th rebid for the day sees volume moved further higher, away from the point of dispatch: Perhaps the generator was concerned the dispatch price would rise above –$100/MWh and they would be forced to dispatch, though note: (a) the prior P5 forecast was for a dispatch price at –$1,000/MWh – so it would have required significant required significant withdrawal of capacity; (b) as it happened the dispatch price was higher (at –$154.54/MWh), but still below where their volume was offered, hence the rebid had no effect at the end of the day, but perhaps calmed some nerves. NO 09:15 NO … or MAYBE? The 13th rebid for the day saw volume moved from +$100/MWh up to +$155/MWh: Despite it not having any effect (in hindsight), perhaps it could be understood as a result of nervousness on the part of the generator (same as in the rebid in the dispatch interval) NO 09:20 NO … or MAYBE? Immediately afterwards we see 14th rebid for the day (and last for the morning): As per the immediately preceding 2 rebids: (a) this one did not have any effect on the final outcome. (b) but perhaps can be understood if the generator was skittish (despite positive price outcomes not been forecast in P5 predispatch)? NO 14:10 YES … but it seems sub-optimal? The 15th rebid for the day (and first for the afternoon) occurs some hours after the morning bunch. It’s important to note that in the immediately preceding trading period the trading price had ended up down at –$225.43/MWh as a result of 4 x negative prices (particularly 13:55 and 14:00), and yet there was no rebid in those periods and the generator sailed right through. We’re curious? Leaving aside that seeming inconsistency, and the fact that a negative price was forecast for the 14:05 dispatch interval prior to the start of the trading period, it is understandable that a rebid was made at 14:03 to shift volume for the 14:10 dispatch interval to a higher-priced bid band as shown here… YES 14:20 YES … but it seems sub-optimal? The 16th rebid for the day happens 2 dispatch intervals later: Volume was shifted out of the -$25.01/MWh (we think in response to a forecast price just below it at –$26.07) up to +$70/MWh. In this case, the dispatch price for 14:20 lands at –$23.77 so it seems that (without the rebid) RRSF1 would have been dispatched. Hence a successful rebid – though we wonder why this was not just done at 14:10? YES 16:05 YES For the 16:00 trading period (i.e. including 15:58, the point where the 17th rebid for the day is made) we see that the forecast dispatch price for all 6 intervals in the next trading period is down at –$1,000/MWh. Hence we can understand why RRSF1 shifts volume here: As it happens: (a) The dispatch price for 16:05 lands at $24.55/MWh, which we presume would have been welcome for the generator; but (b) The CPD price for the DUID was down at –$973.53/MWh meaning it needed to maintain its volume down at –$1,000/MWh to be dispatched to capture that positive price (and would have, in the process, shifted the price lower) . YES 16:10 YES , we think The 18th rebid for the day sees a reversal of the prior rebid – which, as noted in the image, might have been because the forecasted half-hour price was for it to be up at +$25.13/MWh: There were no other rebids from other QLD generators for 16:10 and yet the rebid from RRSF1 dropped the dispatch price down to –$999.99/MWh . Ouch! This is just one more illustration of how “Risk” is an increasing feature of the NEM these days , as explored in Theme 2 within Part 2 of our Generator Report Card . YES it was effective (in that it changed the price)… but NO, we don’t think the generator would have liked the outcome. 16:15 YES Perfectly understandable, then, that the 19th rebid for the day followed immediately afterwards – with the shift of volume up to +$155/MWh: We do wonder , however, why many of the earlier rebids did not move volume like this (i.e. up many bid bands)? Note in this instance that a number of other portfolios also rebid in response to the price drop (including some ‘Not Well Formed’ even with a Loose definition ). They are food for other Case Studies… YES 16:25 NO … or MAYBE? A gap of 1 dispatch interval afterwards, we see the 20th (and final!) rebid for the day: Despite it not having any effect (in hindsight), perhaps it could be understood as a result of nervousness on the part of the generator (same as in the rebid in the dispatch interval) NO Wow! That was a busy day for this particular generator (and a number of others as well) … (C) Who do you know who can help us? Hopefully the case study above gives you some idea of the one of the activities we’re investing heavily in, aligned with our Reason-for-Being of “making the market more understandable, so our clients can make better decisions” ? Our prime focus needs to be the growing number of clients using ez2view (and/or our other software products) – but we’re also happy to share some insights like this Case Study to the readers of WattClarity. As noted at the top, there never seems to be an end to the ways in which we can continue to improve, and we wonder if you know of people who would easily slot into our team to help us do either or both of the following: Market Analysts … who can help us understand more Software Engineers … who can help us build faster We’re keen to hear from those who can help us understand what we have missed , or misunderstood , in the Case Study above. That’s not the only role these ‘Market Analysts’ would play for us, and we have happy to discuss further (one-on-one) with interested parties. (a) For instance, we have a growing number of guest authors on WattClarity who are helping our readers by sharing their insights here – but importantly also helping us directly as well ! (b) These guest authors are a subset of the broader group of people who are helping us in various ways to understand different nuances of the NEM better and better … some part of our ‘Customer Advisory Board’. Our ‘ things to do’ listing (more formally called a ‘Backlog’) contains enough already to keep us going out till around 2030 or thereabouts – no joke. That list keeps growing in a variety of ways (e.g. we’ve added a number of additional insights, already, in the process of putting this Case Study together). It’s a nice position to be in – and we are grateful of our client’s appreciation of us in that: (a) A growing number of clients are using our software tools; and (b) There’s no shortage of helpful suggestions coming in from this expanding client base (some new, some 10+ years into a relationship). We’d like to be developing more quickly, if we could find a way to utilise additional resources who could hit the ground running with us (given what we’re doing, we don’t have a lot of time to focus on recruitment and elaborate onboarding currently). Hence it would take a pretty particular person to be able to slot in and contribute well at the present point in time. We’re keen to talk with those who can help us in either (or both!) of these ways – and don’t have pre-set ideas for how these arrangements might work. Hence please do point them in our direction: (C1) Call us on +61 7 3368 4064 ; or (C2) Provide details for us on this feedback form .",

    "title": "How Retailers Use Contracts to Hedge Customers",
    "date": "08-10-2019 10:19:00 AM",
    "content": "To some readers of WattClarity, the use of hedging contracts may be a little mysterious. However, based upon my prior experience, working at four different retailers within the NEM, I thought I’d take the opportunity to describe how electricity retailers usually hedge their customer portfolios. The first thing to understand is that there are a variety of contracts that are available within the NEM that a retailer can employ to manage their portfolio. We’ll consider two of the main types of contracts, swaps and caps that may be utilised. Swap Contracts The first contract to consider is the swap contract, which is an agreement between buyer and seller which “swaps” revenues to provide a fixed price. Essentially, the buyer of the contract wants insurance against prices above the agreed price and the seller wants insurance against low prices. If we look at the financial flows, they can be expressed as follows: Strike Price = Fixed Contract price Spot Price = Variable market price (i) Spot Price > Strike Price Buyer Profit = (Spot Price – Strike Price) Seller Loss = (Strike Price – Spot Price) (ii) Spot Price = Strike Price Buyer Profit = 0 Seller Loss = 0 (iii) Spot Price < Strike Price Buyer Loss = (Spot Price – Strike Price) Seller Profit= (Strike Price – Spot Price) If we assume the swap contract is agreed at $100/MWh, then the buyer and seller profits can be shown in the simple chart below, which represents the financial performance in a single period (currently a half-hour), whilst in reality there will be thousands of these in a contract period, such as over a year which has 17,520 settlement periods. What is key to understanding these contracts is that they are financial contracts that do not relate to physical generation or customer load, which means that parties are obliged to make payment regardless of their individual circumstance. Notably, this means that “ Force Majeure ,” where parties may be able to exclude themselves from obligations due to extreme events do not normally apply. The net result of these contracts is if the generator produces constantly at the contract level (such as a coal fired plant) and the customer (such as a smelter) consumes at the contracted level, then the sales and purchases respectively, are transacted at the contract price. In reality, customers will normally use more or less than the contracted energy and the generator may produce more or less due to performance issues or profit maximization. I will just examine contracts with respect to the retailer in this analysis. Cap Contracts The other main contract employed in the National Electricity Market (NEM) is a cap (or call option), which only pays the buyer when the price exceeds a predetermined level and the seller receives a premium for providing the contract. Also, a floor (or put option) is the mirror of a cap, but the buyer pays a premium to receive an insurance against prices falling below an agreed level. Taking the concept a little further, a swap is actually the combination of a cap and a floor, where the strike price is the same and the premium amounts cancel each other out. In the NEM, cap contracts are usually struck at $300/MWh, such as those contracts listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and this most likely represents a level at or around the cost of diesel fired generation. If we also chart the payout for a $300/MWh cap, we will assume a premium of $20/MWh is paid and we get the following chart of profit and loss for buyer and seller. Hedging a Portfolio The next step is to examine the level of hedges employed by retailers to best provide price certainty as their customers are usually contracted at a fixed price, regardless of their actual consumption. It is important to understand that cap contracts are usually 24 hours a day, 7 days a week whilst swap contracts are usually defined as: – Flat (or Base) – 24/7 – Peak – 7am to 10pm, working weekdays only, Eastern Standard Time – Off-peak – all times that are not Peak Retailers will purchase these hedges to cover a portfolio in a given NEM region, and these are currently NSW, South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania. As a representative example we have taken AEMO’s Net System Load Profile (NSLP) which is an aggregate profile of all the small customers in a given network area that don’t have interval (half-hourly) metering. In figure 3, we examine the data for the NSLP for Country Energy’s network area, which is regional NSW, outside Sydney, Wollongong and Newcastle. In hedging this portfolio, ideally, we wish to minimise exposure to the energy spot market and there are effectively only two levels of swaps that we can purchase, namely peak and off-peak. So, to minimise our exposure on average to zero, we would purchase swaps such that the average half-hourly consumption in peak and off-peak is equal to the contracted level of swaps. In the chart, the blue area represents the level of off-peak contracting or the level of flat 24-7 contracts that would be purchased, whilst the additional green area represents the peak contracts. The profile traces represent the minimum, average and maximum customer loads for each of non-workdays (Saturdays, Sunday and public holidays) and working weekdays. Additionally, the red area illustrates a potential level up to which caps could be purchased to cover the maximum expected load, likely to be a time at which the spot market price is highest. What is important to understand is that whilst the contract prices are known and there may be historic data available such that a meaningful forecast may be constructed, we will not know with certainty what the volume or price differences will be against the customer portfolio for each contracted period. As such, the retailer margin needs to incorporate a provision sufficient to cover this expense (or incredibly rare circumstances, retailer profit). The retailer will then have the following net positions: (i) Long: Swap Contract level (MW) > Customer load (ii) Short: Swap Contract level (MW) < Customer load (iii) Square (zero exposure): Swap Contract level (MW) = Customer load I have summarised the financial impact in the following table: Generally speaking, it is usual that most of the time, each period of exposure will usually add to portfolio costs rather than reduce it as most customers are correlated with system demand, which is highly correlated with price. i.e. prices tend to be below the contract price at times of low demand and high when the contract level is insufficient to cover demand. If you were to choose a lower or higher swap contract level, you are effectively going long or short respectively with regard to the portfolio. Under that scenario the financial impact is simply the difference between the average spot price for the contract period and the contract price, multiplied by the number of MWh’s in the contract period. i.e. your portfolio benefits from prices above the contract price under a long scenario and a low average price when you are short. The choice to deviate and go long or short is ultimately a trading decision and the difficulty in getting the exact MW level of contracts to match the portfolio. Some retailers may choose to employ caps as a risk management measure at a level up to the maximum expected demand. However, caps will add to portfolio costs, especially where the portfolio has significant “load flex” which is well illustrated in figure 4, which shows the NSLP for Energex’s network area during the first quarter of 2017,which covers mainly households in South East Queensland, so if you used caps in this scenario, you’d need to additionally purchase caps at a level around the same as swaps, if you wished to cover maximum expected demand. Alternative approaches to Hedging It is important to understand that energy retailers are not necessarily obliged to purchase standard swap and cap contracts in the manner described above. Small retailers often lack sufficient credit to purchase hedge contracts, or their portfolios might be smaller than the usual contract size, which is usually traded in multiples of 5MW. Some approaches that may be taken include: (i) Purchase a Load Following Hedge , which is a fixed price, variable volume swap, meaning that the retailer has a certain price for all energy consumed. These contracts may be offered by generators to assist a retail business, but the contract price will be higher to reflect the fact that generator is selling less capacity than a firm volume contract. (ii) Purchase just a cap to insure against potential market events that may send the company out of business. (iii) Have a portfolio of some small offsetting generation such as small-scale renewables or diesel generation. Editor’s note: Some retailers include a specific focus on procuring Negawatts as a non-firm demand response option from selected customers in their retail customer base to try to achieve the same effect as that offsetting generation. . (iv) Do nothing and hang on for the ride. Risk Management Policies Risk Management is a whole discipline in itself, but it is important to consider that any credible electricity retailer will have a risk management framework that will define particular policies for hedging, and these will likely include: – Types of contracts that may be employed (i.e. swaps, caps, futures etc.) – Minimum and maximum hedging levels – Minimum/maximum MW exposure in any period – Use of Earnings-at-risk, Value-at-risk methodologies – Suitable counterparties, maximum exposure to each – Additional limits that may apply in specific NEM regions Whilst retailers are free to hedge as they see fit, most large businesses adhere to IFRS9 which was formerly the IAS39 accounting standard. I will avoid delving into the accounting standards but there are some key impacts from this standard: (i) Caps are regarded as an “ineffective hedge” i.e. whilst they may at times be a prudent choice for risk management, they will likely not be counted as a hedge against a portfolio such as retail electricity portfolio. (ii) To be hedged, usually you’ll need to be between 80% and 120% contracted, i.e. you will need to buy peak and off-peak swaps such that they are within that range of your expected average demand. (iii) Financial reporting will often show volatility in the business due to the change in the underlying value of these contracts over time, as the reporting does not offset the expected customer revenues from electricity sales Conclusion I have attempted to provide some insight into how most retailers hedge their portfolios, mainly using swaps and to a lesser degree caps. This is based upon experience but some retailers, particularly smaller ones may utilise a different approach or none at all. We would reasonably expect that most larger retail businesses would employ a similar approach to the way we have described because they will likely adhere to the IFRS9 accounting standard. ——————————————- About our Guest Author Warwick Forster is an experienced energy professional with 20 years of experience covering energy trading, risk management, market operations, retailing, pricing, renewable project development and energy storage.

    "title": "Investments in increasing the flexibility of Coal-Fired Power",
    "date": "01-10-2019 12:35:00 PM",
    "content": "The transition that the NEM is undergoing has been described by others as moving from a “Baseload and Peaking” plant mix to one which could be described as “Intermittency and Flexibility”. On WattClarity we previously posted about “The death of ‘baseload’ and the rise of ‘cycling’” whilst we were developing our Generator Report Card . This transition is unavoidable (and might be accelerating) – what’s of more interest to us is whether it’s being managed well, or not so well. As noted before (e.g. this prognosis of a train-wreck ) there is much evidence to suggest that we could be doing this much better than we are currently – indeed, we invested considerable time in the Generator Report Card investigating a number of different ways in which we’re not doing as well as we should. (A) More flexibility required in future With an increasing volume of energy being supplied on some occasions by intermittent (wind and solar) plant primarily bidding currently* at $0/MWh or below, other dispatchable plant will be required to provide the balance between this intermittent supply and demand at all times. It seems certain that flexibility will be of increasing value into the future . * readers need to remember that there is nothing that mandates that solar and wind generators bid at or below $0/MWh – or indeed at any particular price: (i) That bid prices don’t need to reflect costs (i.e. under the rules) is one of the central tenets of our market design (as discussed here as an introduction to this beginner’s guide to how dispatch works in the NEM ); (ii) If solar and wind generators see collectively start receiving less revenue (spot + contract) than they need to survive (arising from increased incidence of negative prices due, in part, to a significant lack of diversity ), it seems logical that bid prices might be one thing that could change. (A1) Capacity mix providing this flexibility Eventually this flexibility will be supplied by a plant mix that has been specifically built for this purpose. However for a transitional* period the current fleet of dispatchable capacity (mostly thermal) will play a large role in supplying these new services. There are: 48 coal-fired units still operational in the NEM, a larger number of gas-fired units (typically running lower capacity factor), a few liquid-fired peaking plant; some hydro; and a small but growing number of scheduled battery storage facilities. All of this capacity will be required to operate more flexibly into the future as the volume of installed capacity of wind and solar increases. Hence investments by their owners to make legacy assets more flexible , and hence more fit-for-future-purpose, are of particular interest to us. * this transitional period might last 2 decades or more till all 48 remaining coal-fired units are closed. This is obviously much longer than a sizeable number of people would wish for, given concerns about the global carbon budget and Australia’s contributions to that. (A2) Two measures of “flexibility”? In the Generator Report Card (from page 47 in Part 4) we specifically focused on the coal units (i.e. rather than other fuel types) with respect to flexibility, given both: (i) coal still supplies the dominant* share of “grid energy” in the NEM; (ii) some misunderstanding amongst the broader group of energy sector stakeholders – a number of whom perceive these coal units as being incapable of flexibility. * We noted in the Generator Report Card how the 48 currently operational coal units remaining in the NEM supplied roughly 75% of total “grid energy” supplied by all plant registered with, and visible to, the AEMO through calendar 2018. In particular, we focused on two key measures: Measure #1 = the ramp rate of the unit (i.e. how quickly it can change output – up and down); and Measure #2 = the minimum load of the unit (i.e. the lowest output the unit can manage). We describe in more detail within the Report Card why these measures are not as simple as they might initially appear. Central to understanding this complexity is to understand that both parameters are perhaps more commercial parameters (in terms of how they are used in the market) than technical ones. Readers will also be interested in this approach taken by Allan O’Neil recently to estimating what the minimum levels of operation are for coal units across the NEM. (B) An interesting example from last week (Stanwell unit 1) My copy of our ez2view higher-end dashboard triggered an email alert to me on Friday last week noting about an interesting development at Stanwell Unit 1 : As noted in the alert, in the 11:40 dispatch interval on Friday the InitialMW recorded an output of only* 80MW, which was down from 366MW only 5 minutes before that. * as I’ve noted on the image, the reason why 80MW is significant is because it’s 60MW (i.e. 40%) lower than the 140MW level (with the 140MW level being what many have come to know as the ‘minimum load’ of the 10 x 350MW Hitachi units installed at the Tarong, Callide B and Stanwell stations). * also worth noting is the speed of the decline. Given that our new “Unit Dashboard Widget” is under intensive development currently, I was keen to see what was visible of this event in this new widget – so here is a slightly newer version (v7.4.5.514) of the software Time- Traveled back to 12:15 back on Friday 27th September (i.e. where we can subsequently see more of what happened than we could on Friday, when some data was still confidential): [CLICK ON THE IMAGE FOR A LARGER VIEW] We can see that the unit was successful in dropping load as it had planned to do from 366MW down to 80MW – hence triggering the orange colour-coded “large change” alerting built into the widget. Furthermore we see that the unit then both: (i) held stably at that low level for a half-hour period; (ii) before ramping back upwards again. We can also see in the chart that the unit had planned to trip a little later on that day and then start back up again (all part of the commissioning process it is undergoing currently). This example highlights an important point – whilst we could take a duration curve approach (like Allan’s approach ) to estimate “minimum generation levels” it’s important to understand that these will likely deliver us a view of the lowest level of operation the market is currently requiring these plant to deliver . This can be useful in many ways (such as in the analysis Allan completed) but it should not be confused with a technical minimum load imposed by plant characteristics. Broadly speaking: 1) the fleet of 48x operational coal units are more flexible than some people might have been led to believe through commentary seen elsewhere; 2) what we currently see, in terms of the range of operation, is determined as much by current market dynamics than hard technical limitations – notwithstanding that there may be additional costs attributable to cycling (heat rate degradation, and more remnant life usage); 3) given they are confronted with the inevitable threats ( and opportunities ) of this energy transition , it seems natural that the operators of these coal units will be investigating how they might make their fleet more flexible at lower cost/risk for the future, and hence be ready to capture the increased value the market will attribute for flexibility moving forwards… As a further illustration of this trend, we Time-Travel the same widget in ez2view back another week (to Friday 20th September) and we see this instance with Unit 1 successfully stepping down to run at a load of only 15MW : (i) this is enough power generated to only cover the auxiliary energy requirements of the unit itself; (ii) capability like this “reduce to house load” is necessary for some units on the grid to support system restoration efforts in the event of some major grid disturbance (i.e. make it possible to restart the grid more quickly than would otherwise be the case); (iii) technically there would be presumably some different furnace firing techniques being used to support this, but these are a layer beyond the overall message in this article. Readers should not misinterpret the meaning in this article – I’m not saying that Stanwell Corporation (or any coal unit operator) might want to operate with a cyclic profile shown in these images – just that experiences like these demonstrate that the coal units can be more flexible than a sizeable percentage of energy sector stakeholders might have otherwise believed. It seems likely that the market will be valuing flexibility more highly in future… —— Finally, it’s worth noting for those interested in the ez2view development above that the prices shown in the “Unit Dashboard Widget” include, in addition to the simple dispatch price for the QLD region, both: the Price derived by AEMO in the physical run of an Intervention period (which did apply at 11:40 as shown above); and that Physical Run Price adjusted by the effect of any constraints bound on that particular DUID (noting they did not apply at 11:40 as shown above) – hence giving a DUID-specific physical dispatch price at the Regional Reference Node .

    "title": "Some observations about Storage",
    "date": "10-09-2019 09:48:00 AM",
    "content": "I was invited to speak in the “Market & Technology” session at today’s “Queensland Smart Energy Summit” in Brisbane – but unfortunately last minute complications means I can’t be there today. For today, I was looking forward sharing some of the insights we generated about Storage in our recently completed Generator Report Card (which we completed in conjunction with Jonathon Dyson and his team at Greenview Strategic Consulting ). It seemed appropriate to speak about storage under a “Market & Technology” session, given several factors, such as: (a) The prior investment we had made in working with the Smart Energy Council and exploring the development of a small-scale Energy Storage Register ; and (b) How, because of the intermittent nature of the wind and solar being the two technologies of choice being deployed in this energy transition (as assessed in Theme 10 ), energy storage – small and large – is going to play a crucial role; (c) But also because too many people seem to latch onto Storage as a “magic wand” – in other words, a technology that is presumed to be able to save us all from challenges emerging from the deployed plant mix, but doing so without really assessing how (and if) it might actually be effective. Thankfully Jonathon Dyson happened to be in Brisbane at the event today and has offered to stand in for me on the session (indeed he will be better than me at sharing some key lessons about large-scale storage, given his experience in helping with commencement of operations at Hornsdale Power Reserve and a number of other large-scale batteries in the NEM). Jonathon’s going to present on his own perspectives – but, in addition, I thought I would share some insights on WattClarity here today: (A) Its early days for Energy Storage In Part 2 of our Generator Report Card (part of the ~170-page analytical component ) we included some discussion about storage under Theme 11 where we note that it’s only “early days in the ramp up of energy storage” (where actual contribution is lagging the volume of buzz it seems to be consuming in the public consciousness at present): We illustrated this by providing the following 20-year trend of the utilisation of hydro and battery storage facilities across the NEM. In the following trend monthly production is shown above the line as a positive number, whilst consumption (i.e. pumping/charging) is shown below the line as a negative number. The NEM has had access to three pumped storage hydro facilities (Wivenhoe, Shoalhaven and Tumut) for all of its 20 year history – yet we see that these have only supplied more than 1% of the average energy consumed in the NEM for only a handful of months since the start of the NEM. Battery storage is the new kid on the block, with its bulk energy supplied shown highlighted in purple from late 2017. It’s clear from the chart that its contribution in energy terms has been an order of magnitude smaller than even the hydro schemes. This should not be a surprise to anyone, as the purpose of these batteries is not* for bulk energy storage but rather like the shot of adrenaline in the heart of the NEM at those important times in order to buy a little time for the heavy artillery to arrive and keep the heart going, longer-term. * perhaps more correctly we should say “not currently” or “not currently, and not for the next decade” because herein is the inherent challenge – for the NEM to operate with large percentages of energy supplied from intermittent solar, and with the assumption that storage will be available to bridge the gap between supply and demand, we need to understand the scale of the numbers we are talking about and just simplistically assuming it to be that magic wand. What is apparent to us (as discussed in the Generator Report Card ) is that: 1) the history of the NEM has provided an environment in which the business models that support storage have not been based on bulk energy storage; and yet 2) that seems to be the role that will be required for the NEM in future years, after more legacy dispatchable plant has been retired and significantly larger volumes of energy are being produced of the ‘Anytime/Anywhere Energy*’ form. * the terminology ‘Anytime/Anywhere Energy’ is discussed in Theme 5 within Part 2 . We wonder whether more could be done to prepare the NEM for this future – and wonder what role organisations like ARENA might play in this? (B) Results for Hornsdale Power Reserve through to 31st Dec 2018 Within the Generator Report Card, in addition to the ~170-page analytical component, we also included a 328-page Statistical Digest as Part 3 in the mammoth report . In this section we included a page for every DUID (i.e. unit) that had operated in the 10-year period ending 31st December 2018. What this meant was that there was a 14-month history shown for the Hornsdale Power Reserve given it began operations at the end of November 2017 as the first large-scale battery in the NEM. Results for HPRG1 (the generation component) and HPRL1 (the pumping/charging component) are shown on adjoining pages, as shown in my (increasingly annotated and dog-eared) copy of the Report: It’s particularly informative to pull out three pairs of illustrations and compare them in series below: (B1) Revenues for Hornsdale Power Reserve For ease of readability I have combined the monthly revenue trends for HPRG1 (the generator) and HPRL1 (the load) one on top of the other in the following illustration from the Generator Report Card: These trends are useful in discussing the three key revenue sources that this particular battery earns: Revenue Source #1 = Energy Market Arbitrage As highlighted in the image, the battery earns revenue from energy market arbitrage on a “buy low, sell high” strategy . In simple terms (i.e. without going down the path of exploring revenue from derivatives) this is the underlying way that all storage facilities need to earn money in the energy market – because they do not, in-and-of-themselves generate energy. Understanding that this battery has paid something between $200,000 and $400,000 each month to charge the battery – and yet rarely earned $500,000 in a month to discharge should help to reinforce the challenges in making this type of business model pay for a large capital investment…. Revenue Source #2 = FCAS Revenues … this is especially the case when we compare to the monthly revenues earned across each of the 8 x FCAS markets . Those readers not intimately aware of Raise/Lower Regulation/Contingency FCAS markets would do well to review this introduction to FCAS penned by Jonathon Dyson (a very widely referenced article) along with the follow-up article here . There is also a case study penned by Allan O’Neil about “What happens when a generator trips” that helps to explain how various facilities contribute – including the Hornsdale Power Reserve. With this background, readers should understand why Hornsdale Power Reserve mostly: (a) Earns revenue from Raise service on the discharge side of the battery; whilst (b) Earns revenue from Lower service on the charge side of the battery. It should also be apparent that there is some complex co-optimisation that can be attempted by the asset operator across all 9 commodities. (a) “Set and Forget” is definitely not an option for battery storage operators – and is also fast fading as a realistic option for operators of wind farms and solar farms . (b) We see it as unfortunate that the form of support for new supply from wind and solar projects (i.e. because of a focus on ‘Anytime/Anywhere Energy’) has, in effect, paid some new entrants to remain naive to some of the complexities of the grid. (c) This lack of understanding risks becoming an broader industry capability gap that will stunt our ability to effectively solve the vexed challenges relating to storage. Readers might recall of other articles written elsewhere about how “the Tesla big battery has smashed the oligopoly in the FCAS market, and reduced prices” . Astute readers should also draw from articles like those another underlying challenge inherent in trying to scale up storage capacity in the NEM and fund it from FCAS revenue – if a 100MW battery in South Australia has done that, what happens to prices as more and more storage facilities enter the market (tip = prices crunch further, killing the business case for their entry). The FCAS market is a shallow market and should not be viewed as a magic pudding that will continue to support the entry of. In this WattClarity article I don’t want to get distracted by various discussions currently underway about expanding the FCAS markets in various ways – such as by the introduction of Fast Frequency Response (FFR). That’s food for a later discussion. Revenue Source #3 = Payments from outside of the market It’s very* public knowledge that the Hornsdale Power Reserve only came to be after some very public support from the South Australian Government. However the specific terms of the agreement between the parties (Tesla, Neoen and the South Australian Government) and the nature of payments made are commercial in confidence – and understandably so, though others have tried to unwind public filings to ascertain. * “very public knowledge” = you’d have to be living under a rock not to have heard of the ‘billionaire’s negotiations via Twitter’. The specifics of this particular case are not the main point here – rather we highlight this to wonder the extent to which ‘outside the market’ payments are going to be necessary in some form to support the development of most of the storage that needs to be developed as discussed above. It will be interesting to watch how the NEM evolves in the months and years ahead with respect to these three separate revenue streams for storage. The analysis we prepared for the Generator Report Card certainly showed there are challenges to be solved! (B2) Capacity Factor for Hornsdale Power Reserve Juxtaposing the second chart from both of the Part 3 pages in the Report Card, we can see an important picture emerge in terms of the round-trip efficiency of the asset : More experienced analysts will understand the inherent challenges in deriving a seemingly precise view of volume of energy produced and consumed where all we have to work with at the start are somewhat imprecise SCADA snapshots of instantaneous rates labelled “Initial MW” in the MMS (within Theme 14 in Part 2 we outline a number of different ways in which the NEM is crying out for greatly enhanced analytical capability). Notwithstanding the possible inaccuracies in compiling numbers in this way the picture above does remind us that storage facilities (pumped hydro, batteries, and other) all consume more energy than they return. This is one of the factors that feeds into the energy arbitrage strategy invoked by the operator in order to make a return (i.e. the spread between “buy low” and “sell high” has to be enough to justify the loss of energy). We will be particularly interested to assess any change in the operational profile of Wivenhoe Pumped Storage Hydro in the months after CleanCo commences operations, in order to learn more about whether the low utilisation of the plant has been more to do with physical constraints (like round-trip efficiency) than it has been with claims of portfolio effects. (B3) Involvement in setting the Price for Hornsdale Power Reserve Each of the pages in Part 3 contains more detail than we have time to cover in this analysis today (e.g. bidding strategies, operating hours, starts and constrained hours), but we wanted to focus on involvement in setting the price for the last of three exhibits: Those readers not intimately aware of the arcane details of NEMDE and the dispatch process would be wise to refer to our prior Beginner’s Guide and the follow-on Intermediate Guide to how Prices are set in the NEM – and also this related article by guest author Allan O’Neil about price setting concepts . In the Generator Report Card, we simplified the multi-dimensional nature of price setting down to a simpler concept of (dominantly) “involved in price setting” (for Energy, in the host Region). Specific details of how we achieved this simplification are described in the Glossary in the Report Card (i.e. Part 5). 1) From the table above we can see that HPRL1 was mostly involved in setting the price when it was low (indeed, at-or-below $0/MWh) whereas HPRG1 was mostly involved in setting the price where it was in the range between $75/MWh and $300/MWh. This fits with the “buy low, sell high” arbitrage principle. 2) However it is also worth noting that both sides of the battery were involved (at separate times) in setting the price at some times when the price was above $300/MWh – in some dispatch intervals well on the way to the Market Price Cap. It is only reasonable to understand that this would be a natural outcome of tight supply/demand balance and scarce energy availability – however these real world realities might not be apparent to some more simplistic energy sector observers. (B4) For a live view of Hornsdale Power Reserve At Global-Roam Pty Ltd, we’re pleased to assist a number of parties with the measures arising out of the Government’s response to the SA System Black event . Amongst other initiatives we are please to be able to provide real-time visibility of how the Hornsdale Power Reserve is operating (in collaboration with Neoen) with the widget located at the bottom of their website here – and also embedded below: The widget shows prices for Energy and Raise/Lower (Regulation) FCAS services – along with charge/discharge rates in MW. Note that it’s no charge to embed this widget on 3rd party websites in the same way as above (just click on the “Embed” button and follow the instructions). (C) Anything new shown into 2019? Since we released the Generator Report Card (on 31st May 2019) we have been inundated with interest from a wide range of parties (some early feedback was recorded here). Great to see it being referenced in a broad range of places – such as in this ABC news article yesterday. One of the questions* we’re commonly asked about the Report Card is whether (and when) we would be considering preparing an update . * that’s not the only question we have been asked – indeed, we previously wrote about these 5 other commonly asked Questions . Short answer to the question is that we’re not exactly sure what we might do, and when – beyond saying that we definitely won’t be repeating the whole exercise every year complete with 170 pages of detailed analysis . It just requires too much investment that would detract from the focus on implementing the insights we’ve already drawn into our software (with a particular focus currently on ez2view ). Partly because of this Question, but moreso because it proves an effective means of answering a number of questions we find ourselves asking, we are periodically re-running updates to the Part 3 production process in order to see the latest data – including the following updated revenue chart for Hornsdale Power Reserve: There’s been a bit of talk recently about the negative prices experienced in recent times (though in terms of WattClarity articles moreso with a QLD focus in recent times). This article showed that the CAL 2019 year (even just till late August) experienced more dispatch intervals experienced prices at or below $0/MWh in South Australia since 2016 – and (already) more than most other years. Interesting, then, to see that the cost of charging at HPRL1 was substantially lower in July and August 2019 – however we also see that mid-2018 saw a drop in the cost of charging so would not get too carried away. (D) Integrating lots of storage for the future One final (brief) note that we have heard in different forums and from different people a complaint that runs along the following lines: I have (or will have) a Semi-Scheduled Wind/Solar facility that is increasingly becoming constrained down, so I am losing production – and hence the Black and Green revenue components. I have (or am thinking about installing) a storage facility on the same site – yet I understand that I cannot directly charge my facility with the energy foregone…. (or words to that effect) Unfortunately I have run out of time today to outline the shortcomings in the over-simplistic nature of this mindset (at least in part of the special licence available to Semi-Scheduled assets in the NEM). This was further discussed in Theme 13 within Part 2 , and we understand that rule changes might be afoot. We look forward to seeing hybrid registrations roll out in future, though note that this will require increased sophistication on the part of the asset operators. As we note in Theme 14 within Part 2 , we all need to wise up for this energy transition to succeed. ———————— Oh, and despite the fact that we have parked our investment in a small-scale Energy Storage Register we still very much recognise the merits of a national Register of Distributed Energy Resources and will watch with interest as the AEMO project is rolled out.",

    "title": "More on those negative prices – how do contracts affect bidding behaviour?",
    "date": "06-09-2019 01:30:00 PM",
    "content": "Much recent discussion about negative spot prices in Queensland, including some prompted by my own article , has questioned how any generator could benefit from having to pa y money to AEMO to generate – since this is what a negative spot price means. Lacking a well-understood motivation for bidding behaviour which results in low and negative spot prices, conspiracy-style theories tend to take root, such as certain generators deliberately trying to drive certain others broke (see for example some of the comments on this otherwise very informative article on RenewEconomy ). This has made us at WattClarity realise that it would be helpful to outline how common electricity derivative contracts operate, and the significant impacts they can have on generators’ financial incentives. This is stuff that is reasonably well known to active wholesale market participants, but can still seem quite mysterious to those looking in. In keeping with this site’s focus on raising general awareness and better understanding of factors arising during the energy transition, we’ve put together this explainer. Swap Basics This is not going to be a deep dive into all types and aspects of electricity derivatives. My aim is to go into just enough detail on one common form of contract – electricity swaps – to make clear how they can give a generator – under certain, limited circumstances – a financial incentive to seek lower spot prices, despite the natural incentive for generators being the opposite. Study the following diagram carefully – it’s the key to understanding this issue and I’ll be referring to it a lot: At the top left in purple are the physical electricity flows and payments between NEM market generators and the spot market operated by AEMO. Generators are paid at the half-hourly spot price for all electricity they produce. At the top right in green are the payment streams under an electricity swap contract . It is crucial to understand that this contract is a purely financial agreement between two parties, neither of whom need be a generator. Such a contract is merely a legal agreement to exchange (“swap”) payment streams which depend in some way on the spot price of electricity. In a swap contract, the Buyer pays a fixed payment stream to the Seller (the generator in the above diagram – but it could be anyone). In return the Seller pays a floating payment stream linked to the half hourly spot price. In practice these payment streams are accumulated over a week or longer, and a single net settlement payment is made one way or the other depending on which is larger, but this is just accounting detail. The Contract Volume is a “notional volume” of electricity, specified at half hourly level, on which both payment streams are based. For the floating stream, payments are the Contract Volume (MWh) multiplied by the spot price. For the fixed stream, payments are the same half hourly Contract Volume multiplied by an agreed Fixed Price (or Contract Price). In many cases the Contract Volume will be a single fixed half hourly volume across the whole contract period – this is a “flat” or “base” contract. Other contracts may have volumes varying by time of day and day type. These details don’t matter to the bidding incentives I’m discussing in this article, which will deal with those incentives in any particular half hour. What’s critical to understand here is that even if the contract seller is a generator, under a standard fixed volume swap there is no relationship between how much electricity that generator physically produces in the spot market, and the Contract Volume . A Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) in the NEM is, in most cases, a special type of swap where the seller is a NEM generator, and the Contract Volume is defined to be the generator’s half hourly production. But even under a PPA, the generator is not selling physical electricity to the buyer – just a stream of payments that mimic the spot market value of that electricity . The Long and Short of It The reasons why a generator might enter into a swap contract as seller should become clearer on looking at all the cashflows in the diagram and realising that a generator can naturally fund its obligation to make swap floating payments in any half hour by generating output equal to or above the swap Contract Volume, earning spot market receipts from AEMO. Let’s assume it generates output exactly equal to the Contract Volume. It can notionally take the entire payment it receives from AEMO and pay this on to the swap Buyer. In return the generator receives payment from the Buyer at the Fixed Price for the same Contract Volume. In this situation (which always applies under a PPA where Contract Volume is defined as generator output), the generator is financially indifferent to the spot price – “fully hedged”. If the generator’s output exceeds Contract Volume, the net effect is that it receives the Fixed Price for that part of its output equal to Contract Volume, and spot price for the excess. We say that the generator is “net long to the spot price” or “long to its swap position”. But if the generator produces output less than the Contract Volume, its spot market receipts will not fully cover its swap floating payment , and the generator’s financial position on the difference (Contract Volume minus output) is the same as that of a buyer of physical electricity from the spot market . We say that the buyer is “net short to the spot price”, or “short to its swap position”. Often, being short like this is not a comfortable position for a generator – its generating plant might have broken down completely, but it is still required to make floating payments to its contract counterparty, whatever the spot price, right up to $14,700/MWh. But if a generator is short and the spot price is negative , the generator wins on both legs! Its floating price “payment” becomes a receipt greater than the amount it has to pay AEMO to take its output, and it also receives the Fixed Price payment from the (now unhappy) swap Buyer. So what determines whether a generator is long or short to its swap position in any half hour? Simply its volume of output, versus its volume of sold swaps. The latter is determined well in advance by the set of swap agreements the generator has transacted with counterparties. Its output depends on the availability of its generation capacity, and how it chooses to bid that available capacity in the spot market. Price Takers vs Price Makers If the generator’s bidding has little or no influence on the spot price – say it’s a very small generator – then it has a fairly simple decision about whether to run long or short, regardless of swap contract volume sold. If spot price exceeds its short run production cost, its best financial position is to maximise output and run long if it can, while if spot price is below its short run production cost, it’s best not to generate anything at all, and run completely short to its swaps – because it’s cheaper to cover its floating swap payments by (in effect) “buying” at the spot price than by generating. A generator covered by a PPA-style swap has an even simpler calculus – run regardless of spot price, because its net position is receipt of the Fixed Price payment for all output and it is therefore indifferent to the spot price. Of course the PPA buyer may not be happy about this when spot prices are very low or negative. For a large portfolio generator whose bidding will inevitably influence the spot price, the decision is more complex. The more output it seeks to dispatch in the spot market (by bidding more capacity at lower offer prices) the lower the spot price will be. Such a generator with a significant volume of sold swaps typically faces a choice between producing more output and running long at lower spot prices, or producing less output and running short at higher spot prices, In many cases the optimum decision is to run somewhat long to its swap position. Crashing the Spot Price However if circumstances arise in which spot prices are low even with that large generator running significantly short to its sold swaps, then the generator may have a direct incentive to increase its output and reduce the spot price further , if it can still remain short enough to benefit from that drop in price. A worked example might help here. I’m only going to show the generator’s spot-price linked payments, namely its spot market receipts and swap floating payments, since these are the critical cashflows: In this example, spot price is low even with the generator running 400 MW short to its sold contract volume (Position A). In Position B, bidding 200 MW more generation at a low offer price to increase output to 1,400 MW reduces the spot price to minus $20/MWh. This increases the generator’s loss in the spot market by $20,000 but its swap floating payments improve by $24,000 (instead of paying $8,000 in Position A it receives $16,000 in Position B because of the negative spot price). In Position C a further increase in output to 1,500 MW drops spot price further, but not by enough to compensate for the fact that the generator is less short (only 100 MW not 200 MW) and its net financial position is worse than in Position B. In practice a generator will never know in advance exactly what relationship may exist between changes in its own dispatch level and changes in the spot price, because this depends on the bids of all other generators. But the general point stands that a generator materially short to its swap volume at low prices has clear incentives to keep prices low and perhaps reduce them even further through its bidding strategy. This is already a long article to cover a fairly simple but very important concept. While it would be good to have time and space to discuss how swaps are traded, why buyers buy them, and how in practice a market might end up with some of its larger generators “overcontracted” (ie with more sold swaps than their “natural” level of output), that would require a whole other article, or series of articles. Suffice to say that recent outcomes in Queensland suggest that overcontracting may just be the case, at least during certain times of day. ——————————————- About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

    "title": "Who’s responsible for those negative prices?",
    "date": "05-09-2019 09:49:00 AM",
    "content": "The increasing incidence of negative spot market prices in the NEM, particularly in Queensland in recent days , has made for colourful press reports and opinion pieces along the lines of “new solar generation floods the market, driving electricity prices to zero and below” . It’s true that the energy production shares of both large and small scale solar PV in Queensland have risen steadily to their current combined level of about 10%, but coal fired generation remains dominant in that state, as well as in NSW and Victoria, accounting for about 80% of electricity produced. So solar “flooding” the market is a slight overstatement, and just as in other markets, electricity prices reflect how all participating generators in the NEM, not just the new entrants, decide to offer their production, relative to the level of demand. Technically, the spot price is set by the offer of one or more “marginal” generators , but these price-setting offers only become marginal because a sufficiently large volume of energy is offered at lower prices by other generators. In particular, spot prices only go to zero or negative levels when enough energy is offered at or below those prices to fully satisfy local demand and any net exports . With maximum solar output (including rooftop PV) peaking at around one third of all production in Queensland during the middle of the day (see below), that leaves the bidding behaviour of the dispatchable generators supplying the other two thirds at least as responsible for those zero and negative prices. For this note I’ve looked at the aggregate bidding behaviour of black coal generators in Queensland in recent weeks, and compared them with their counterparts in NSW. In particular I was interested in analysing how much energy has been offered at zero or negative prices, and how this relates to aggregate “ mingen ” levels for coal plant – the short-term minimum output levels that thermal generation units can be dialled down to while remaining online. For slow-start units like coal- and gas-fired steam turbine plant, output at mingen can be a significant fraction of capacity, perhaps 30 – 50%. Minimum output constraints can force such generators to offer mingen volume almost regardless of price, or face going offline, incurring significant cycling costs of unit shutdown and startup. The need to remain dispatched above mingen can thus be an important constraint on the ability of coal-fired generators to “get out of the way” of potential negative prices, which they might otherwise seek to avoid by offering less of their output in negative or zero price bands. So one obvious hypothesis about negative price incidence is that the “flood of solar” is forcing coal units to dispatch down to their mingen levels. With solar effectively offered to the market as “must run at any price” (not strictly true, but an adequate working assumption for this analysis), are coal generators being forced to bid the price down to zero or lower simply to stay online in the middle of the day? Mingen numbers for the NEM’s coal-fired units are not public data, so I have derived estimates for each coal-fired unit by analysing several years’ data on distribution of unit output when online (example below), and selecting values at around the 90 th to 95 th time percentile (in many cases the generation duration curve for these units exhibits an obvious inflection point near this range). As a cross check I consulted AEMO’s ISP planning data , which in all cases gave smaller mingen values, often very significantly lower. Using the higher empirically-derived levels is a conservative assumption , because it will tend to show coal plant being more constrained by mingen than may technically be the case, and less able to avoid negative price outcomes by reducing volume offered at low prices. For the Queensland and NSW generators online at any time, I’ve then compared aggregate mingen levels to volumes offered at prices of zero or below, against the output at which they were actually dispatched in the market, and to their maximum available volumes. The results for nine recent days are charted below, also highlighting periods where the half hourly trading price was negative. Some key observations stand out from this chart: Queensland coal-fired generators, as a group, appear to have significantly higher mingen levels as a proportion of capacity than do NSW coal-fired generators. Because the mingen estimates were derived from historic dispatch data, it’s not clear whether this reflects technical or behavioural differences. Above these already higher mingen levels (which are likely to exceed true technical minimums), Queensland generators are offering substantially more “discretionary” output at zero or negative prices (the gap between mingen and the “Zero/Neg Bid” lines) than their NSW counterparts. The Queensland generators reduce volumes offered at zero/negative prices overnight, but are much less prone to do so in mid-daylight hours where dispatch levels are frequently even lower than overnight, despite the recent incidence of daytime negative prices. Queensland coal-fired generators generally operate within a significantly narrower daily output range , in both proportional and absolute terms, than their NSW counterparts. This could be explained in part by the higher fuel costs of NSW coal-fired generation, but also reflects different approaches to bidding strategy. This analysis is limited in scope and offered more as a thought-starter than as definitive, but it appears that if Queensland’s coal-fired generators wanted to avoid or minimise recurring negative spot prices in the short term, they should be able to achieve this simply by reducing the volumes they themselves offer to the market at very low prices, while still dispatching above technical minimum generation levels. The fact that they have not adjusted their bidding indicates a tolerance for very low daytime prices, counterintuitive as that may seem. There are very likely to be economic drivers outside the spot market for the bidding behaviour observed here, and this apparent tolerance for very low spot prices. This is because bidding behaviour can be strongly influenced not only by spot market outcomes but also by any contract positions (for both electricity and fuel) that generators may hold. A generator which has sold electricity swap derivatives exceeding its physical dispatch volume has a net financial position similar to a buyer in the spot market, and actually gains as spot prices fall . There could even be strategic considerations behind some generators being prepared to endure very low daytime prices in the short term. Paul McArdle’s recent WattClarity article explores a few of these possible drivers further. In the longer run, as the proportion of low-cost but variable renewable energy in the system continues to increase, the impacts of mingen levels and other constraints are likely to amplify market price signals and other economic incentives for dispatchable generation and other forms of capacity (storage, demand-side) with greater technical and economic flexibility to replace retiring coal fired generation. The same signals will also reduce the relative returns to other less controllable generation sources like solar PV. This is what markets are designed to do. ——————————————- About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

    "title": "Four quick thoughts, as the run of negative prices in Queensland continues…",
    "date": "04-09-2019 11:51:00 AM",
    "content": "On Friday last week I posted this article noting how the year-to-date total of number of dispatch intervals at or below $0/MWh in the Queensland region of the NEM was already more than double any prior yea r (and that was not even at the end of August). Well, that pattern has just continued through the weekend and into the current week, the first week in spring (where incidentally we see a forecast temperature peak at 33 degrees in Brisbane today, which seems a little bizarre) . I snapped this screenshot from NEMwatch v10 dashboard in the 10:00 dispatch interval showing the second instance this morning where the dispatch price has dropped down to –$1,000/MWh in the Queensland region : As shown on the image, the first price drop occurred at 07:05 this morning, which was the first period in what’s historically been called the “peak” pricing period (we might want to speed up our thinking about the structure of “peak” and “off-peak” hedges, like Dave Guiver spoke about before ) . As discussed in our Generator Report Card (not just in Theme 2, but also elsewhere through the 170-page analysis) the level of risk in the NEM is escalating, and what’s happening with these negative prices is one small part of this. On WattClarity here we will be further examining different aspects of these risks, as time permits – but this is meant as a supplement to the fuller consideration provided in the Generator Report Card. All I have time for today is to pose four questions: Q1) Which new entrants have been ‘swimming naked’? I’ve read in several places before at quote that’s been attributed to Warren Buffet – something along the lines of: “You only learn who’s been swimming naked when the tide goes out” Now my understanding is that Warren was speaking about investors in the broader market – however the general sentiment behind that quote could be also equally attributable to generators in the National Electricity Market. After firstly reminding readers (and myself!) that it’s impossible to actually know a participant’s motivation, though it does not stop us guessing , I thought it would be useful to use this snapshot from our ez2view higher-end software package showing the power stations operating in the QLD region up until the 10:00 dispatch interval this morning: Note that the drop in dispatch price to –$1,000/MWh was the second in the trading period, meaning a Trading Price for the half-hour down at –$413.65/MWh for the half-hour ending 10:00 (i.e. generators paying $413.65/MWh to stay online). Even allowing for revenue earnt from LGCs generated in this half-hour, this would seem to indicate no-one comes out of this half-hour whole. I’ve helped those unfamiliar with the “QLD Region” Schematic within ez2view by annotating the plant that are either Wind (only 2 currently, with more on the way) or Large Solar (loads, with many more coming as well!). These essentially fit into two groups: 1a) Seem impervious (or oblivious?) to negative prices There’s a group of Wind and Solar Farms we can see in the Schematic above that can be seen to run straight through the period of negative pricing this morning: (i) Perhaps their contract structure is such that it’s someone else’s* cost (and risk) when prices are negative – so are happy to sail through with their own revenue covered by some form of PPA independent of spot pricing. (ii) Perhaps they should be aware and responding – but are oblivious, or do not know what to do (we understand that there a number of ultimate asset owners for Wind and Solar plant across the NEM that have become quite irate at what they see as poor service provided by their current Asset Managers, so expect to see some churn on that front in the near term). (*) Readers need to understand that their is no such thing as a free lunch – the task is moreso to try to understand where the ultimate cost (and risk) of paying to generate ultimately resides… 1b) Those that seem to have responded to negative prices by backing out There’s another group of assets that can be seen to turn off in order to avoid negative prices. For these assets, it would seem to suggest that both: (i) They have some incentive to avoid sustained runs of negative prices; and (ii) They have developed the means to watch the market and respond. Note that there is a “correct” way to turn off (i.e. through the bidding and dispatch process, via the Semi-Dispatch Cap) and there are also other ways to switch off that don’t seem to follow the intent of “bidding in good faith” ( discussed previously ). We don’t have time to delve into the details of each particular asset at this point – however note that in our Generator Report Card we did invest considerable time to assess where every wind and solar plant offered all of its volume at the point of dispatch through calendar 2018 in order to try to infer how it might be contracted – and even, perhaps, what benefit they might be ascribing to LGCs. See the Wind and Solar fuel types in Part 4, for those who already have downloaded their copy . ————————— Readers should note that there are other reasons why units might be offline – for instance it’s our understanding that Oakey 2 Solar Farm is still recovering from the major damage unleashed by the storm that uprooted most of the station many months ago now (still no official news I have seen about the recovery?). Hence readers should use caution when interpreting the data presented in the schematic. Q2) But exports from QLD are constrained flowing south… Now it is useful to point out that exports from Queensland to NSW are constrained flowing south because of a transmission outage between Armidale and Tamworth. (a) This is current scheduled to last all day today (working day), and also tomorrow (b) For those with their own access to ez2view , you can see this in constraint set “F-N-ARTW_86”. Here’s a snapshot from NEMwatch v10 a full 90 minutes later (at 11:30 dispatch interval) showing QNI flow south still constrained and some massive price differentials (i.e. QLD price very low) continuing fairly continuously since the 09:55 dispatch interval that saw the first dispatch price down at –$1,000/MWh: However even if participants did not know this was going on, one still has to wonder why they don’t respond when prices drop far below any revenue they might earn back on their LGCs? Q3) What’s going on at the QLD coal plant? It’s also logical for people to wonder what’s going on at the coal plant – as discussed in the Generator Report Card , there has been an increase in capacity offered at and below $0/MWh at the remaining coal units across the NEM ( excerpt included here ). Interesting to see that the volumes offered are at far greater levels than just at technical minimum loads – which might be inadvertently giving those not so familiar with an incorrect view of (over-exaggerated) “inflexibility” of coal units. When he finds a bit more time, guest author Allan O’Neil might unpick this one a bit more for our readers… Editor’s Note The following day (Thursday 5th September 2019) guest author Allan O’Neil had published this analysis here , to remind everyone that it’s not just “new solar flooding the market” that has driven prices below the floor. However in general terms, readers should understand that the trading teams at both Stanwell and CS Energy understand a fair bit more about the market than new entrants probably do. One clue to understanding what might be a reason for the way they are bidding might be to look at the broader market across all 9 commodities, to also see that FCAS lower prices have been elevated this morning at the same time as prices for energy have been through the floor… shown here in a “NEM Prices Schematic” widget that’s been available in ez2view online for some years. One more reminder that this energy transition is demanding that we all upgrade our analytical capability . Sadly the greatest gap is perhaps seen for a number of the newer entrants (because we have unfortunately allowed – or even encouraged – that schism ( Theme 5 here ) to emerge by way in which we have incentivised, and continue to incentivise , new capacity with not so much focus on capability ). Q4) What does all this mean for the Market Price Floor? A final question to leave readers with today – what does all this mean for the Market Price Floor? I can’t actually remember what logic was used when the NEM was formed in setting the price floor down at –$1,000/MWh. In the early years of the NEM (i.e. where there were very few instances of negative dispatch prices actually seen) it was perhaps ultimately a bit academic at the time. However as we progress into an environment where negative prices become much more frequent and an active part of a participants trading strategy (no matter what their technology), perhaps it is time to start asking more serious questions about whether the Market Price Floor should be lowered – and, if so, what to?

    "content": "On Friday last week I posted this short comment here on LinkedIn about how we could start a new meme about “ 0/MWh being the new Black ” when confronted with what seems to be an increasing number of instances where prices in the Queensland region have been at $0/MWh or below . On that occasion I included this snapshot from our NEMwatch v10 entry-level dashboard: That tongue-in-cheek comment seemed to strike a chord with a number of people – including with Josef Tadich at Telsa who echoed the new tagline here . There have been a number of other articles and comments I have noticed about this seemingly increased trend of zero and negative prices (hey, even the economists at the AEMC got into the act with this brief note ). So I thought I might have more of a statistical look … (A) Level of risk in the NEM is escalating In our Generator Report Card 2018 we did place considerable emphasis on a number of different aspects of changing price patterns – with these emerging patterns being one manifestation of the changing nature of risk in the NEM. We discussed several of the underlying causes for this change in risk in Theme 2 within Part 2 of the 170-page analytical component . We also previously pointed at some of this in our WattClarity article of 9th August following some media references: We’re sad to see that one outcome of this increased risk being investor’s money disappear in smoke – but are realistic that this was an inevitable outcome where investors were lured to the NEM on the seemingly simplicity of “anytime/anywhere energy” that is quite removed from reality. We noticed the recent decision made by developer/investor John Laing to suspend further investments into the NEM (as reported in PV magazine , and on RenewEconomy ) and expect that it won’t be the last. In that Theme within the Report Card itself, we discussed how one of the harbingers of that increased risk can be clearly seen in Figure 2-2 within the Generator Report Card . This figure, has been copied into this article today. It shows (for each year of the past 20 years in the NEM) total energy-constrained energy offered in every year of the 20 years of NEM operation to the end of 31st December 2018, aggregated into analysis-ready bid price ranges over three core colour groupings: There are two main points that WattClarity readers here need to recognise in the trend attached: Observation #1) Whilst Registered Capacity of plant in the NEM in 2018 (see “RegCap as Volume” above) is largely the same as the capacity installed in the NEM in 2012, the volume that this can physically produce is significantly lower . This is another reminder that we really should be avoiding the ‘beginner’s mistake’ of focusing too much on installed capacities, and not enough on volumes . See the Report Card ( Theme 14 within Part 2 of the 170-page analytical component ) to understand why it is essential that bids are analysed on a dispatch interval basis as dispatched and taking account of energy constraints that apply in the market. Sadly in our experience not doing this are mistakes that are commonly made, leading to erroneous conclusions and business/policy decisions being made. Poor analysis (including all-to-common mistakes like this) are just one other aspect of risk in the NEM! Observation #2) Even amongst this (reduced volume of) energy-constrained available energy, there has been a massive hollowing out of energy-constrained volumes of capacity offered in the ‘normal’ green price ranges: 2a) To make this macro change clear, we use three principal colour ranges in this trend: (i) blue being $0/MWh and below , (ii) green being between $0/MWh and $300/MWh , and (iii) red being anywhere above $300/MWh up to the Market Price Cap , as it applied at the time). 2b) There has been an increase in volume offered at $0/MWh and below ( not just from wind farms and solar farms), and an increase in volume offered above $300/MWh (e.g. at least in part because liquid-burning peaking generators might now be facing SRMC above $300/MWh on occasions). That has come at the expense of volumes offered in the green ranges. 2c) In simple terms, this means that is delivers a greater likelihood of more volatile price outcomes moving forwards – with a steeper bid stack, it only takes a relatively small change (e.g. demand change, unit trip, wind to die, constraint to trigger etc) to drive the price sky high. 2d) We need to keep in mind that this has happened even before 5 minute settlement has begun (something that will drive volatility further still ). (B) Trended incidence of (high and low) extremes Given the underlying changes on the supply side noted above, and a more volatile demand shape as well (i.e. lower load factor, with more uncertainty driven by several different weather-related variables and prices themselves) it seems entirely logical to expect that we would be seeing increased incidence of price extremes in the market. Given our own particular focus on Queensland, and because negative prices have seemed to be a very rare occasion in the past up here, it came as no surprise to us that the level of incidence of dispatch prices settling at $0/MWh or below has increased markedly through 2019 compared with all prior years (note that these numbers were crunched on Monday 26th August – so the YTD results for 2019 are already too low given what’s happened through this week): Sticking to Queensland but looking at the other end of the scale we see that the incidence of high prices in 2019 YTD has been much lower through 2019 thus far compared to the heights reached in CAL 2017: Note that the incidence of all prices above $300/MWh were shown here – but pay particular attention to the incidence of prices above $10,000/MWh which peaked in CAL 2017 (mainly due to a volatile summer 2016-17 ): (1) That volatile summer following prior ones led to QLD Government directions on the Queensland generation sector (ironically trumpeted as a ‘win’ for government ownership despite the fact that common government ownership enabled the 3-into-2 merger in the first place that removed competitive tension ); (2) Whilst the direction was specifically on Stanwell Corporation its effect will also have been felt at CS Energy – and hence washed through the whole region; (3) We note that these same directions were much more quietly removed from the generators from 1st July 2019, so we will have to see what effect this has – particularly in the tighter supply/demand period in the coming summer; (4) Keep in mind that the other factor at play here is the formation of CleanCo as a third Government Owned Corporation operational from October 2019 (a politically palatable de-merger of sorts with Wivenhoe, Barron, Kareeya and Swanbank E being shifted into the new corporation). The (very) non-normal distribution of price outcomes in the NEM makes it essential to keep an eye on extreme price outcomes in the NEM (historically just on the high-side, but much more in future also on the low-side) it is important to recognise that the majority of price outcomes remain in the green price ranges – as shown here for each of the 105,000 (approx) dispatch intervals in each of the years for the QLD region since the start of the NEM: Within these green ranges, we can also see a marked shift (beginning from 2015) towards significant increase in median prices across all dispatch intervals in the NEM (this was the same phenomenon observed with respect to Q2 2016 , Q2 2017 (the “off the charts” results caused a stir ) and Q2 2018 – did not have time to update for Q2 2019 sorry ). Stretching the focus beyond just Queensland and narrowing back in on the extremes again we see a more complex picture across all 5 regions: Here we can see that QLD has a long way to go to reach the incidences of low pricing seen regularly in both TAS and SA over a number of years now – though it would not surprise us if QLD reaches (and even surpasses those levels) fairly quickly, given the scale of the development pipeline of solar farms on the go…",

    "content": "Without resiling from last week’s criticism of how the headlines from AEMO’s 2019 Electricity Statement of Opportunities (ESOO) were communicated, it’d be churlish for me to fault the depth of disclosure and data sitting behind those results. Literally tens if not hundreds of thousands of hours of combined effort must have gone into the data, forecasts, modelling, and analysis that underlies the ESOO, and AEMO makes available an extraordinary amount of detail on it all. This post covers only a tiny fraction of that detail but hopefully enough to bring out some key factors that drive the reliability assessment, and prompt some discussion about changes that AEMO is pushing for and perhaps on how we’ve got to where we are. But one last beef – why call it something as impenetrable as the “Electricity Statement of Opportunities”? (Yes I know, that title’s probably mandated in some clause of the NER (what?) and requires a rule change proposal to be assessed by the AEMC (who?) to vary it). But wouldn’t something like “ NEM Reliability Forecast ” be a lot more meaningful?? The key things I want to focus on in this post are: exactly how have the extended outages of Loy Yang A2 and Mortlake 2 in Victoria been treated and how do they affect the results? have AEMO’s load forecasts changed and is this driving the generally better reliability (or least lower expected USE ) projected in this year’s assessment? what’s the story with outage rates for coal-fired generators – are they getting worse? how much new investment in what kind of generation would be needed to materially improve reliability? why and how is AEMO looking to change the way that reliability is defined in the NEM? Let’s open the box then. How has AEMO dealt with the current extended outages in Victoria? Whether Loy Yang A2 and Mortlake 2 are returned to service in time for the peak summer period (broadly early January to the end of February) will make a big difference to the reliability of the system in Victoria over summer 2019-20. While the owners of both generators have apparently reaffirmed their guidance on expected return dates this December, AEMO has decided to assess Victorian reliability this summer by assuming that there are still significant risks of delays at one or both plants. Four sets of scenarios with each of these units either in or out have been run, and the “headline” reliability figure for Victoria is a weighted average of these four sets of results, summarised in Table 15 from the ESOO: NB – Don’t take the “numbers of households without power” literally – it’s unhelpful shorthand for the quantity of load curtailment that might be necessary under extreme conditions, but that curtailment would rarely if ever be delivered entirely through rolling blackouts. Also the footnote stating that “load shedding is still expected to occur” when expected USE is greater then zero but below the reliability standard is quite misleading – it should say that load shedding could still occur. Graphically, these scenario results, measured in terms of expected Unserved Energy (hopefully I don’t have to remind readers what this term means!), look like this: So if both units do come back into service by the advertised December dates, Victorian reliability this summer would fairly comfortably meet the NEM standard, but if both are delayed until the end of summer the (un)reliability measure would be more than double that standard. AEMO has pretty clearly made a pragmatic call here to factor in some broad brush estimates around the chances of delay at both units. The quandrary AEMO faced in preparing the ESOO was that ignoring any delay risk and producing a result below the threshold could, under the NEM rules, leave few tools in its arsenal to deal with delays that did subsequently eventuate, through authority and lead time to contract with reserve capacity providers. Arguably it would also understate the nature of the reliability risks to the system given these extended and complex repair tasks. It’s also notable that AEMO’s formal assessment assumes: no continued operation of two Torrens Island A units (2 x 120 MW) in South Australia over summer. These units were previously scheduled for closure in late 2019, however AGL has sought permission from the South Australian government to delay closure until March 2020. If approved, AEMO estimates that assessed USE levels in Victoria would fall by about 0.0006% to a level only just over the 0.002% Reliability Standard. the South Australian government’s emergency diesel generators (about 270 MW nominal capacity) will not be available to the market and only run as a last resort to avoid load shedding. How have load forecasts changed? A major driver of reliability risks is the peak demand level projected in each region, particularly the so-called “10% POE” forecast or extreme demand peak that might arise in a very hot summer experienced once every ten years on average. Most of the load curtailment events in AEMO’s modelling are associated with demands at close to these levels (see p76 of the ESOO for instance). The following chart shows AEMO’s forecasts this year vs those in last year’s ESOO and recent actual demand outcomes We should normally expect to see the 10% POE forecasts above recent actuals, since the forecasts represent a one in ten year outlier and the actuals reflect whatever weather we actually had. With the exception of Queensland which has seen strongly growing peak demands, the 2019 ESOO forecasts for next summer (2019-20) have not changed much since the 2018 ESOO, but are expected to grow more slowly in the out-years than previously forecast. This may be one reason for the generally better reliability forecast in this year’s ESOO than in last year’s. Is coal becoming less reliable? There’s been more heat than light on this topic in most public discussion (with the notable exception of the great work in the Generator Report Card by Global Roam and Greenview Strategic Consulting ). AEMO has to quantify and support its own assumptions for the ESOO modelling and they make interesting reading. The chart that I think best summarises things is this one: I’ve highlighted two key observations from this data which shows levels and trends in full forced outage rates across different generation types: brown coal plant reliability has fallen substantially over the past four years with the last two years being particularly poor while there’s no obvious time trend over recent years, there’s a very big discrepancy between black coal plant forced outage rates on different sides of the NSW-Queensland border The first point has been commented on for some time, and emphasised by AEMO in both last year’s and this year’s ESOO (not to mention the real world impacts in January this year ). I’m less aware of discussion of the second point, and would be fascinated to hear of any reasons why there’s a threefold difference. How much would new generation improve reliability? (or How much new generation would improve reliability?) Given the fairly apocalyptic coverage of the ESOO results, and loud calls for “like for like” replacement of every plant that might retire (and perhaps even those that have already retired), it’s surprising that not very much additional firm capacity would need to be added into AEMO’s modelling to produce results that are in line with either the current reliability standard, or even an enhanced standard that AEMO would like to see (more on this below). This is best summarized in this AEMO table: Under the current reliability standard, AEMO’s modelling says 125 MW of new firm capacity in Victoria this summer is all that’s needed. For the next ten years. Across the whole NEM! (And that’s assuming two Torrens Island A units don’t operate over this summer; otherwise that 125 MW number would vanish as well.) But summer blackouts? And what about Liddell closing by 2023?? No breach of the standard according to current methodology! Now to be fair “no breach of standard” is far from the same thing as “no risk of blackouts” (or load curtailment). And this is probably a major driver for AEMO’s push for an enhanced reliability standard, under which the extra firm capacity levels in the right hand half of the table would be required (these amounts are single year levels and shouldn’t be added up – a single investment in 500 MW of permanent firm peaking capacity in NSW in time for 2023-24 would be sufficient to cover all years in the horizon.) It’s also worth pointing out that AEMO’s forecasts here assume ongoing investment in rooftop PV and completion of a number of large scale renewable projects currently under or committed for construction (including Snowy 2.0), but don’t yet include things like the transmission upgrades required to reliably deliver Snowy 2.0’s capacity to market or to improve transfer capacity between regions, because these upgrades are not yet categorised as firmly committed under the NEM’s labyrinthine transmission investment regime. So why ask for an enhanced Reliability Standard? It’s fairly hard to believe we would be having the debate we are having if such small capacity additions as those indicated in the table above would truly “fix the reliability problem” by getting us under the current reliability threshold. AEMO has evidently come to this view and in this ESOO and a number of other recent submissions has tried to draw attention to the broader dimensions of reliability. Here’s an example, namely a chart showing the probability distribution of unserved energy (USE) across a set of scenarios run for NSW in 2023-24, the summer of which follows assumed retirement of Liddell: I’ve made a number of annotations to try to better explain this chart. The bars represent results of individual model simulations (out of the thousands run for this year) grouped or “bucketed” into load curtailment amounts along the horizontal axis. Location along this horizontal axis is the amount of load curtailment in each bucket (expressed as percentage USE, but I’ve overlaid absolute quantities in megawatt-hours). The height of each bar on the vertical axis is the proportion of simulation results falling into that USE bucket. The chart excludes the roughly 57% of simulation results with no load curtailment at all. Roughly 22% of the simulation results (which I’ve coloured blue) have some USE but less than the current 0.002% threshold which is about 1,200 MWh for NSW. The remaining 21% of simulations coloured red have levels of USE greater than 0.002%, right up to a whopping 24,000 MWh which is very roughly two hours of all demand in NSW on a hot summer day. (Note that the chances of this outcome are tiny, indicated by the low height of the bar). But remember from the table in the previous section that AEMO’s analysis showed that no additional capacity is required to meet the current 0.002% reliability standard in NSW for this year. This is because the reliability standard is framed in terms of expected USE, where “expected” has a precise mathematical definition not as “likely” or “reasonably possible”, but as an average, probability-weighted across all scenarios including those with no USE at all. So comparing amounts of curtailment in individual simulation results, or buckets of results, to the 0.002% standard as AEMO has done here is really an apples to oranges comparison. But AEMO is arguing that framing the standard purely in terms of oranges – statistically “expected” USE – runs the risk of having too many bad apples: outcomes with “unacceptably” large amounts of load shedding. AEMO is therefore arguing that the 0.002% threshold should be re-purposed away from being a mathematical construct to a more tangible level of load curtailment whose risk of exceedance should be less than a 10% chance – the chart above shows that the chance in NSW for 2023-24 is 21%, well above this level. The following chart from the ESOO shows that the proposed enhanced standard would be breached, or close to breached, in the south east mainland regions from 2023-24: This is not the place to get into discussions about what represents “unacceptably” large amounts of load shedding, what the cut-off and its probability ought to be, or whether AEMO’s suggestion is the right solution, but I hope it does at least explain why AEMO has concerns about the current framework, and has assumed its current far more active role in the reliability debate. ——————————————- About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

    "date": "23-08-2019 01:31:00 PM",
    "content": "I’d rather not add to the number of conspiracy theories in circulation, but I wonder if there’s a conspiracy to make understanding our electricity system in general, and its reliability in particular, as difficult as humanly possible. There’s no doubt it’s a sophisticated piece of machinery with a lot of complex science and technology behind it. We then wrap it in a highly regulated market founded in arcane mathematics and towing a boatload of jargon and acronyms, operated and overseen by a plethora of organisations with obscure names and functions, trying to navigate and administer a morass of laws rules regulations procedures codes and other legalese. Even when trying to measure and communicate the answer to as basic a question as “is there a risk of power cuts this summer?” we make a complete mess of how best to do that. Case in point being the reporting of AEMO’s 2019 ESOO this week. From a quick scan of the press and social media you could draw conclusions as diverse as “millions of households and businesses face being plunged into darkness” to “there’s a 99.998% chance of no cuts at all”. You’d be wrong on both counts. The reasons why include the very obscure way “reliability” is defined and measured in the NEM, the poor job that’s done in communicating it, the apparently unceasing “ energy wars “, and an evident decision by AEMO to become a more public player in the policy debate as suggested by the escalating stridency of its messaging efforts . So perhaps no conspiracy after all. Here I’m going to stretch (ignore?) Paul’s promise of a “measured walk through what the document says” to instead focus on one key topic – how reliability is defined measured and communicated, and what this year’s ESOO is actually saying on this subject. A few headline facts Before getting into the details, a few headline facts distilled from that ESOO, focussing on Victoria this summer since that’s aroused the most commentary: AEMO assesses the risk of needing to curtail some Victorian demand this summer as about 1 in 3 if one or both of the two large units currently offline for major repairs are delayed in returning to service; and AGL is not granted permission to extend the operation of two of its Torrens Island A gas units in South Australia over the summer. The apparently miniscule “0.002 per cent” or “0.0026 per cent” figures being thrown about in the press or on twitter are NOT probabilities of power cuts. They are a very confusing way of expressing the “average” size of any cuts as a proportion of all the energy supplied in a NEM region across an entire year . Given that very large denominator (about 45 billion kilowatt hours for Victoria), you would hope to see very very small numbers indeed! The form and amount of any demand curtailment would be very dependent on exact circumstances. Talk of “millions of households” being blacked out for hours is shorthand and potentially quite misleading. Victoria this summer is the only region and year over AEMO’s 5 year formal assessment which fails the NEM’s reliability threshold. AEMO does not believe that the current reliability measure and threshold are fit for purpose. What are we trying to measure? “Reliability” has a very commonsense meaning when it comes to electricity – the power stays on 24/7 with no interruptions. But interruptions can happen for many different reasons – most of them to do with local poles and wires – and the narrow type of “reliability” measured in the ESOO ignores almost all of those reasons, and focusses only on there being enough total supply available to meet everyone’s aggregate demand for power, whatever that level of demand happens to be. This form of “reliability” is also distinct from system-level supply interruptions caused by unexpected trips / sudden failures of major equipment, bushfires etc, which in industry-speak fall into the system security category. The 2016 SA blackout being the canonical example. If there just isn’t sufficient generation and transmission available, then some demand has to be curtailed to keep the total at or below what can actually be supplied – unlike government or household budgets, electricity systems can’t run deficits. “Curtailment” can mean anything from contracting with specific very large users – eg aluminum smelters – to temporarily reduce their usage, through to rolling blackouts of entire sections of the distribution network. Last summer we saw both forms in action in Victoria to cope with very high demands and supply shortfalls on 24 and 25 January . Assessing this form of “reliability” over future periods obviously requires forecasts – principally of weather which is a huge driver of summer demand peaks, as well as of output from the increasing amounts of wind and solar generation on the system , and can also reduce the capacity of transmission lines to carry power from generators to load centres. Forecasts of “generation availability” are also required since (despite what some politicians might tell you) no form of generating plant is 100% reliable “24/7” . Across a large and diverse generating fleet there are inevitable unpredictable breakdowns and other needs to take plant offline for repairs and maintenance. Off to the casino we go With neither the weather nor generation performance being predictable, the forecasting required to fully assess system reliability (even in the narrow sense we’re talking about here) is very complicated, and getting more so . It’s certainly not good enough to take a “best guess” of peak summer demand, and line that up against total nameplate generating capacity, perhaps allowing for one or two large generating units being offline for repairs and taking a stab at how much output wind or solar might be producing at the time. Instead AEMO has to (metaphorically) go to the casino and model literally hundreds of scenarios which “roll the dice” on temperatures, the level of demand, the output from variable renewable generation, capacity of transmission, and the availability of large generating units. Various statistical and sampling techniques underly this work but in essence it’s a form of “ Monte Carlo modelling “, which yields probabilities of different outcomes, from no reliability issues in some scenarios (where the weather is benign and generators don’t break down) to scenarios where extensive demand reductions would be necessary because of extreme weather and multiple generation failures- just like the real-world case actually experienced this January. Now, that modelling is necessarily complicated and sophisticated, but communicating what it says shouldn’t be as hard as it seems to be. Great expectations Sticking with the casino analogy, if I roll a fair die, the chance of getting any particular face showing is 1 in 6. If the faces are the usual one-spot to six-spot, then the “expected number of spots” is three and a half. What? There’s no face with 3.5 spots, and in any case a three- or a four- spot is no more likely to appear than a one- or two-spot. What does three and half spots being “expected” even mean, and what use is the number? Its meaning is essentially mathematical, and it represents the average of the number of spots I would see if I threw the dice thousands of times, added up all the individual results ranging from one to six, and divided by the number of throws. More practically, it would also be the “fair” price for a bet on a single roll of the dice where I paid that price in dollars to play, and the casino then paid me a number of dollars equal to the number of spots on the die. This “mathematical expectation” is how AEMO reports – is required to report – the results of its reliability scenario modelling. It is essentially the average amount of load curtailment across a large number of scenarios many of which will have no curtailment and others which will have widely varying amounts of curtailment (quantity of load interrupted) depending on the specifics of each scenario. But in a twist that seems inevitably to catch out almost everyone, that expected amount of curtailment – let’s say 900 megawatt hours which is a nice tangible number – gets expressed as a percentage of total annual energy. The result is the “expected Unserved Energy (USE)” percentage measure which peppers the ESOO and confuses the hell out of those trying to interpret it. Problem One : If you think about that, the USE measure takes a small sliver of “expected” load interruption, generally amounting to a few percent of maximum demand, which in any one scenario would typically occur only for a few hours on a single extreme day, and then divides it by the total energy supplied over 365 days. Of course that’s going to yield a tiny percentage that carries very little intrinsic meaning to anyone. Problem Two : The averaging process crunches into a single value all the underlying richness of information about the likelihood of no curtailment vs some curtailment, and about the range and risk of different amounts of shortfall (including so-called “tail risks” of very extensive shortages). Balancing or confusing further? To be fair to AEMO, its recent ESOO reports have tried very hard to expose more of the detail behind the measure and modelling results and methodologies, and AEMO is pushing hard for revisions of the reliability measure (which are bound to be controversial, at least within the rarified atmosphere of optimal electricity market regulation). But the fact that the measure, and the reliability threshold which triggers actions for AEMO to arrange for reserve resources, are expressed as tiny percentages can give casual observers an entirely misleading impression of supply reliability. A very common misinterpretation is that the USE percentage is a “probability of blackout”, which at levels of around 0.002% looks astronomically low. In actual fact, “probability of blackout”, or “loss of load probability” (LoLP) – like “probability of rolling a six-spot” – is a very simple measure to extract and report from AEMO’s reliability modelling. It’s just the proportion of scenarios (assuming these were all equally probable) in which there is any load curtailment at all. For Victoria this summer, AEMO puts that number at about 1 in 3. Then, perhaps in an attempt to swing the misinterpretation balance back the other way, when discussing possible amounts of load curtailment, AEMO falls into a common habit of expressing megawatt hours of curtailment by reference to average household power usage levels. So a Victorian USE of 0.0047% in some downside scenarios, which corresponds to about 2,115 megawatt hours of load curtailment, is expressed as “equivalent to” interrupting up to 1.3 million households for up to 4 hours. This glides over the fact that if, as in past years, AEMO arranges for short term load reduction contracts with large industrial users like aluminium smelters, much of the load curtailment might fall on those users – who are paid for providing this service – and not on actual households. Surprise finding – reliability has improved?? There’s much more that could be said and picked out of the ESOO, and I owe Paul an apology for perhaps producing more of a rant than an analysis, but I’ll close with a couple of charts that illustrate – counter-intuitively in view of the general commentary – that compared to last year and apart from this summer in Victoria, AEMO is actually forecasting significantly higher reliability almost across the board in this year’s ESOO than in last year’s. Go figure. ——————————————- About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

    "content": "This morning the AEMO released his 2019 Electricity Statement of Opportunity a few days prior to the 31st August deadline – you can access it at the linked image below: Understandably, given the content, there was significant media coverage of some of the core messages included in this planning document: 1) In the AFR, Angela Macdonald-Smith and Mark Ludlow write how “Victoria prone to blackouts this summer as grid wilts” in a front page story . The AEMO CEO, Audrey Zibelman also contributes “How to avoid blackout summers” . 2) Over at the Australian, Andrew White and Perry Williams write about “Risk of summer blackouts rises with more generator failures” . 3) In the Age, Nick Toscano and Peter Hannam provide the article “Power cuts may hit as many as 1.3 million Victorian homes this summer” . 4) On the ABC, Richard Willingham wrote “NSW, Victoria warned of summer blackout risk if power supply doesn’t improve” . 5) On RenewEconomy, Giles Parkinson writes “AEMO worries about ageing coal fleet and summer extremes, wants new tools” . …. and there will no doubt be many more articles written in the days, weeks, and months ahead. The headline of this is story is that it’s one more reminder that the NEM is facing heightened risk , for a collection of different reasons. We’re grateful that guest author Allan O’Neil has agreed to invest some time to take a measured walk through what the the document says – particularly noting the different issues flagged for summer 2019-20 (hence AEMO’s keen interest in Reserve Trader ) and also summer 2023-24 (probably a year later than it might have been, given the delay in closure of Liddell ). Stay tuned for that…",

    "title": "The Fuel Mix supporting the NEM is at the start of a massive transformation",
    "date": "20-08-2019 02:01:00 PM",
    "content": "Since the release of the Generator Report Card on 31st May 2019 we have been involved in providing a number of briefings to different audiences about different aspects of what we have found in the analytical processes supporting the Report Card. There are two upcoming events currently scheduled that are open more broadly to those who are interested to come along: (tomorrow) Wednesday 21st August from 16:30 Australian Energy Council – Sydney CBD The Australian Energy Council has organised this event for their members (but are happy for others to come along as well). They have created this page with details of the event, including how you can register . Tuesday 10th September approx 12:00 Queensland Smart Energy Conference – Brisbane The Smart Energy Council has organised the “Queensland Smart Energy Conference” for Tuesday 10th September at the Royal International Convention Centre and has asked me to be involved in a session (11:00-12:30) on “Market and Technology”. I have not given it much thought to this point, but am sure whatever I present will utilise some of the insights gained from the analytical process supporting our Generator Report Card . Following some of the prior events (including last Wednesday’s event organised by the Australian Institute of Energy ), we’ve received several requests from attendees wondering if we could share three specific figures we have used to illustrate how the fuel mix supporting the NEM is at the start of a massive transformation . (A) Theme 3 (of 14 themes) This fact is of such importance that we highlighted this as Theme 3 (of 14 key themes) within Part 2 of the ~170-page Analytical Component provided in the Generator Report Card: Given requests coming from different people about this one in recent days, we’ve chosen to describe (here) some of what was discussed in the Generator Report Card under this theme. (B) Two important aspects about the transformation There are two aspects of the above statement that need to be understood together . Unfortunately, different parts of the broader energy sector commentariat seem to selectively ignore either one, or the other, of these aspects (seeming to reflect the views at either extreme of the Emotion-o-meter ). One of these aspects can be seen in the trended, stacked fuel mix chart that was featured on page 9 within Part 2 of the Generator Report Card: (click on the image for a full-screen view of this page) In the Generator Report Card we utilised 20 years of generation data to provide a broader context to what’s changed (and what’s not changed) in relation to this transition. In Figure 2-4 shown in the page above, we consciously limited the date range to show only the most recent 9 years ending 31st December 2018 in order to focus on the following two aspects: Aspect 1 = the transformation is “ massive” As can be seen in the chart above, the bulk energy supplied by the wholesale National Electricity Market is still dominated by energy supplied by coal-fired generation . As noted in the Report Card under this chart, “coal capacity still supplied ~75% of grid energy in the 2018 year” . 1a) Furthermore, this large volume of energy has been supplied, following the closure of Hazelwood at the end of March 2017 , is supplied by just 48 units across Queensland (22 units), NSW (16 units) and Victoria (10 units). (i) For comparison purposes, there were 242 units in total that were available to the market in December 2018; (ii) That’s 48 units supplying 75% of the “grid energy”, whilst close to 200 other units supplying the remaining 25% (using gas, hydro, wind, solar, etc…). 1b) These 48 units could be viewed as the current “work-horses” of the NEM 1c) As noted on the page above, all of these units will be closing in the years ahead (some sooner than others) – because of their criticality to the current energy mix (and because of the other services they provide – with inertia being just one) it will be a complex , and very important , process to ensure that this is done properly. 1d) Unfortunately the closure of Hazelwood showed some examples of what not to do (prior closures – like Northern, Wallerawang and so on – were far less critical as the share of energy supplied by those plant when they closed were much lower). That’s another reason why the level of risk in the NEM is increasing . Aspect 2 = however the transformation just “at the start” On the following page in the Generator Report Card, we included a pair of trends that typify the dichotomy (or even the “schism” ) that has opened up in the conversation about this evolving energy transition : 2a) The top chart (fig 2-5) shows the change over 5 years in installed capacity of registered generation assets supporting the NEM, aggregated and identified by fuel type. (i) In this chart we see the growth in capacity of wind farms and solar farms (over 4,000MW in new capacity split evenly between both). (ii) We also see that there is a similar-sized decline in capacity for coal-fired power (almost 5,000MW for black and brown coal together). The most recent (and largest) step change down was the closure of Hazelwood at the end of March 2017 . (iii) This is a picture that some like to show when talking about the pace of the transition – and one which people might mistakenly interpret as implying that the solar and wind generation has replaced that lost from the closed coal. (click on the image for a full-screen view of this page) 2b) The bottom chart (fig 2-6) shows quite a different picture – but over the same 5 year period. In this case we show the change in energy supplied by those same fuel types over the period. (i) In what may be a surprise to some readers , it shows that the reduction in supplies from brown coal (much moreso after the closure of Hazelwood, which was heavily utilised, than after the earlier closure of Northern, which was only used sporadically) have been supported mostly be an increase in production from black coal. 1. The existing black coal fleet had spare capacity to ramp up and support the loss of energy – however this does mean that they are running at higher utilisations (across fewer units across the whole coal fleet) – hence higher risk . 2. Unfortunately, a somewhat mistaken obsession with installed capacities has obscured this important fact. (ii) Whilst this “black for brown swap” has had the net effect of reducing the emissions intensity of the NEM, it also raises questions about what might actually support the next withdrawal of a coal-fired plant (be that Liddell as announced, or some other station that might close more unexpectedly)? In simple terms, there is less “spare” energy that the remaining coal units would be able to ramp up further to supply – and level of risk will increase still further because of less units supplying the bulk of the energy … As noted in the Report Card itself, “whilst installed capacities are perhaps the most widely quoted numbers, it is production volumes that are more important from an operational and pricing perspective” . We hope this helps to clarify why this is the case – and one of the big challenges to be resolved as more of the coal fleet close in the years and decades ahead… (C) Why did we choose to exclude the impact of rooftop PV from this chart? Astute readers (of this article, and of our Generator Report Card itself) will notice that we have excluded consideration of rooftop PV (and embedded unregistered generation more generally) from these trends. We have done this consciously , and after careful consideration – and will explain why in a follow-on article in the coming ways. For those with their own copy of the Generator Report Card, you can find some discussion of this under Theme 14 in Part 2 of the ~170-page Analytical Component that constitutes one of the core pieces of value in the Report Card. ————— Those in Organisations who have already arranged access to the Report Card can download it here with your organisation’s email address.

    "title": "Transitional challenges require greatly enhanced analytical capability (exemplified in MT PASA Rule Change proposals, for instance)",
    "date": "15-08-2019 12:29:00 PM",
    "content": "Yesterday evening, I spoke (with co-author Jonathon Dyson for his Greenview team) in Sydney at an event organised by the Australian Institute of Energy about the Generator Report Card . The crowd was good, and the questions were great (with some spilling onto social media, into email – and it’s too early for the carrier pigeons to have arrived). Thanks to those who attended. On that note, we’re looking forward to a similar Q&A session with AEC members (and others welcomed as well) in Sydney next Wednesday evening, 21st Augus t. I expect that the questions will be different, because the audience is different again. However the story today is about something else I was able to do yesterday – afforded by the opportunity of being in Sydney yesterday, and with submissions closing today at the AEMC. I was invited to meet with the relevant people in the AEMC to speak about our views on two rule change proposals submitted by ERM Power relating to the AEMO’s MT PASA process (in part due to prior comments at the end of this note here on 7th August ), with suggestions both for: 1) Improved transparency of data flowing out of it along with an improved methodology; and 2) An extended data range included in the process (to line up better with the specifications of the Retailer Reliability Obligation, amongst other thing). In talking through the proposed changes (and the challenges we’re already experiencing with the energy transition) with the AEMC, the parallels between what ERM Power had proposed and what we had summed up in Theme 14 within Part 2 of our Generator Report Card were unavoidable: We summed up this theme by noting that the “Transitional Challenges require greatly enhanced analytical capability” (and talked through a few examples of how we have seen this present during the AIE session). We did not have the specifics of what ERM proposed in mind when we wrote the report card ( released on 31st May – nearly 3 months ago) – however we do believe that the general thrust of what ERM is asking for is aligned with the general sense of what we were stating under this theme: It’s worth noting that what ERM has proposed was through two different rule change proposals – but the AEMC have (thankfully) chosen to address them together. My shorthand (with limited time) of what the ERM are proposing is as follows: ERC0270 Rule Change Request: MT PASA ”Transparency and Accuracy Amendments Rule Change Request ” ERC0271 Rule Change Request: MT PASA ”12 Month Extension of Duration Rule Change Request” This first part of the ERM submission is here . If we’re talking about “parts” of a rule change request, then this one would seem to be able to be considered in 2 parts (making 3 parts in total, including ERC0271). Part 1 = Firstly, to extend data transparency into the MT PASA time horizon: 1a) It was late in 2010 (a long time ago now!) when real-time generation data began being published for all Scheduled and Semi-Scheduled (and some Non-Scheduled) generators – a great boost to transparency. 1b) the proposal asks that DUID level available data also be published with each weekly update (or ideally every 3 hours, we hope!) with the MT PASA Region Availability data sets. Ideally this should be done for all DUIDs for which real-time data is also available – not just Scheduled Generators. (i) This would include Semi-Scheduled plant (ii) It ideally should include significant Non-Scheduled plant (using the same logic as used to determine their need to be visible in real time) ; and (iii) It should also include the DUIDs that would be created for the new “Demand Response Service Provider” category that might be implemented ( discussed further here – notwithstanding the concerns raised previously here about mooted change) 1c) there’s also a suggestion to require publication of the forced outage rates assumed in the probabilistic modelling. Having invested effort through the Generator Report Card process in trying to interpret forced outage rates purely from the public data published in the MMS, this would be a welcome addition. 1d) finally, there’s also suggestions about what specific measure of demand should be published in the data set (see this prior article for discussion about the confusingly large number of measurements ) Part 2 = the second part relates to the methodology used in the MT PASA process. Recently this moved from a deterministic process to a probabilistic process (resulting in the publication of metrics like LOLP (Loss of Load Probability) and USE (Unserved Energy) such as noted here for the coming summer ) – there are a couple components of this 2a) modelling the outcome of a 90%POE assumed demand trace , and including this in the combination of 50%POE and 10%POE 2b) ERM suggests that the AEMO include consideration of the probable contribution of generation projects that are committed and under construction, but not yet registered (so not included in the modelling methodology currently). This second part of the ERM submission is here . Part 3 = this component of the proposal asks that the time-range covered by the MT PASA is extended from a 2 year time horizon out to a 3 year time horizon. Amongst other benefits, this will make the MT PASA updates: 3a) line up better with obligations for wholesale market customers that could well be triggered under the Retailer Reliability Obligation as soon as this month of August (somewhere in the next 2 weeks) when the 2019 ESOO is published; and 3b) It will also line up better with the notice of closure obligations … though it would seem that these types of requirements would essentially imply the need for MT PASA to be extended somewhat beyond 3 years, perhaps? To the extent that we have been able to think this through, it all seems a fairly reasonable request, and likely to deliver good value to wholesale participants, but also to the growing number of retail customers signing up to renewable PPAs stitched to the output of particular renewable projects, also (the anticipated maintenance schedule for which should also be visible in MT PASA with the same level of accuracy required for Scheduled generators). It is understandable that the AEMO (in particular) might be daunted by yet one more change to the information management processes on top of the huge job that is 5 minute settlement. Seems to me that this means our conversation should focus on “what do we have to do to enable this to happen”? Submissions to the AEMC are due today – further details from the AEMC are here (perhaps the AEMC will take these thoughts here into account) .",

    "title": "5 FAQs we’re asked about the Generator Report Card (for discussion at AIE this evening)",
    "date": "14-08-2019 11:52:00 AM",
    "content": "Our co-author (Jonathon Dyson of Greenview Strategic Consulting) and I are speaking this evening at an event organised in Sydney by the Australian Institute of Energy , providing some context from our Generator Report Card about what the 20 years of generation history we’ve just clocked over in the NEM might tell us about what could happen over the next 20 years: For those who can’t be there (I’m told the event is sold out) I agreed to post some of* the presentation we’ll be walking through this evening * note that what I can post here is limited primarily because we’ll be investing most of the time walking through parts of the 530-page document itself, particularly in response to questions we’re asked by the audience. Because the Generator Report Card is so deep , and so broad , in terms of the analysis completed and insights conveyed, it’s not possible for a pre-canned presentation to properly convey all that it entails. Hence our keenness on seeing where audience questions take us – after setting the scene. In order to provide some context to this more interactive Q&A, I thought it would be useful to answer 5 of the most commonly asked questions we have consistently heard since (or even before) we released the Report Card on 31st May 2019 – less than 3 months ago now: Q1) Why did we invest the ~10,000 hours in developing the Generator Report Card? That’s a very good question (and one we asked ourselves a number of times as weeks stretched into months earlier this year as the analytical effort rolled on!) . In reality, there are a number of different answers to the question, each of which is relevant – and each of which is important in their own way. Four of these answers are shown here: Reason #1) Because the NEM has reached a 20 year milestone It’s hard to believe in a way, but it’s been a little over 20 years since the NEM first commenced at the end of 1998 (and almost 20 years since our company has been in operation in helping clients make better decisions – by making complexity understandable for them ) . Given the 20 year anniversary , it seems a great opportunity to look back over the 20 year history, in order to see what can be learnt (what the data is actually telling us) that might help to inform views of what might be coming down the wire for the next 20 years – both risks, and opportunities. Note that we have found it a little strange that none of the official organisations who we might think might be entrusted to do something like this seemed to be organising to deliver something like this – but then, on the flip side it’s represented a commercial opportunity for us (and our customers have thanked us for investing the time). Reason #2) In response to confusion, misunderstanding (and what seems some pretty shallow analysis on occasions) Especially as this energy transition gathers pace (but also compounded by the natural attrition of organisational experience as older hands have progressively exited the industry, and due to increased complexity in the industry, and for other reasons as well) we have witnessed what seems at times to be increasing levels of confusion and misunderstanding amongst the growing pool of those directly involved in the wholesale market – but also in the much broader (and perhaps even more rapidly growing) group of spectators, observers and commentators on the wholesale market. The term “energy expert” is a greatly over-used, and abused, term (and I am not claiming to be one of them ) . Rather, we are intensely interested in understanding what an objective and detailed view of the data actually shows – warts and all. Reason #3) As intensive R&D for our software Over the (almost) 20 years we have been serving our clients, our software (i.e. the primary means by which we serve) has come a long way. However we know that we have much that still needs to be done to meet our client’s emerging challenges in the years ahead. Initiating this Generator Report Card process was a legitimate “excuse” for us to focus on a very intensive period of research (leading into a development phase we have moved into) in order to ensure we continue to help clients to meet their needs (and, in some cases we hope, meet their needs even before they are generally aware of it. Some of the insights generated through this process did not make their way into the report itself, for a variety of reasons. Rather we’ll look forward to delivering them through software like ez2view (and to a more limited extent NEMreview and NEMwatch etc) in the weeks and months ahead. Reason #4) Because we’re just naturally insatiably curious. This was not the main reason why we did it – though it sure did help through some very long weeks as we struggled with some of the more complicated things we were trying to do with an AEMO MMS Data Set that really is not fit-for-purpose in terms of some of the things we are trying to do. Across the two main organisations , we appreciate having people onboard who are naturally inclined this way (and the external analysts helped as well), and would certainly welcome others if they could let us know of their interest . Other reasons… Those 4 are not the only reasons – there are others we might shed light on in future (or perhaps keep to ourselves). If you have any questions about this, please let us know. Q2) What is the Generator Report Card? For those who purchase the Generator Report Card, they receive a hard copy of the Report, and also access to the electronic PDF that they are welcome to use across their organisation: Inside the report itself is essentially two separate (but complementary) pieces of value – there is ~170 pages of analysis across Part 2 and Part 4, and there is 328 pages of stats (condensed down to 1 page per generator – each page encompassing millions of points of data): ~170 pages of Detailed Analysis 328 pages in a unit-level “Generator Statistical Digest “ Using the extensive 20-year history of NEM generation we have assembled in a transformation of the AEMO’s MMS database (plus some additional data from the Clean Energy Regulator and the Bureau of Meteorology) we have performed numerous discrete pieces of analysis – many of which could warrant a separate report in their own right. Rather than split these pieces of analysis separately, we deliberately chose to include them all in this Generator Report Card to reflect the holistic nature of the challenges inherent in this transition. We chose to split this analysis between: Part 2 (14 x Key Themes ~60 pages); and Part 4 (Aggregations ~100 pages) …for easier readability . This analysis is described further here . Included as Part 3, we have compiled a rich statistical page for every DUID (i.e. unit) in the NEM for which there was operational data within the 10 year period to 31st December 2018. This covers both: 1) Generators visible to AEMO; and 2) Scheduled Loads (i.e. charging of batteries, and pumping for pumped storage hydro). The structure, and content, of each of these pages in the Statistical Digest are explained here . On WattClarity, we have posted already a number of different articles referencing some of the Themes contained in Part 2 – as just 60 of the 110 pages of analysis: Theme 2 In Theme 2, we explore a number of different ways in which of “The level of Risk in the NEM is escalating” . For instance, on 9th August 2019, we posted this article that spoke to some of the analysis contained within the Report Card (but pertaining to what was reported in some of the media reports related to pricing patterns occurring at the time). Theme 5 In Theme 5, we explore how “the NEM is developing a them-vs-us schism” – with a particular focus on why this has come about, and what the implications This schism was discussed briefly in this article of 8th August 2019 (and even as far back as August 2014 ) – and was also mentioned in Giles’ initial review of the Generator Report Card . It will be explored further in future articles on WattClarity here. Theme 8 In Theme 8, we explored a number of different aspects of “Thermal plant is ageing, and this brings concerns” with a focus (intentionally) heavier on coal than gas, given the much larger share of energy generated by coal-fired plant in the NEM in calendar 2018: For instance, on 14th June 2019 we posted this article that included some introductory trends included in Theme 8 within Part 2 of the Report Card (noting that there were another 38 pages included in Part 4 about different measurements of the “dependability” – or not – of thermal generation ). Theme 9 In Theme 9, we explored a number of different aspects of “Emerging challenges for managing system security” in Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) For instance, on 12th August 2019 we posted this article including excerpts from this Theme within the Report Card, highlighting calculated values of inertia supplied by synchronous generation. Theme 10 In Theme 10, we explored the challenges inherent in times “when the Sun does not shine and Wind does not blow” across all Renewable Energy Zones defined in AEMO’s Integrated System Plan 2018: For instance, on 26th July 2019 we posted this article highlighting the analytical framework used to interpret the correlation co-efficient As opportunities arise, we might link in more of the analysis we have performed for the Generator Report Card into articles here on WattClarity… Q3) Who’s the audience for the Generator Report Card? Because of what we do, our client base is naturally broad (much broader than just those directly involved in the wholesale market, for instance). It was our intention (and it has turned out to be) that the Generator Report Card would also be similarly broad in its applicability: Those who have already come onboard provide some validation of our sense that would be of high value to a wide range of stakeholders in the NEM, and the NEM transition: Government Departments and Market Bodies Direct NEM Participants Indirect NEM Stakeholders All the NEM-focused departments of Energy have purchased their own access to the Generator Report Card (across Canberra, Adelaide, Hobart, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane). Most of the Market Bodies also have access to the Generator Report Card. A growing number wholesale market participants have purchased access to the Generator Report Card – be they registered as: 1) Generators; 2) Retailers; or 3) Large Energy Users.Some of these market participants are newer entrants to the NEM (in which case the insights we share about the Semi-Scheduled category, and battery storage, will be particularly relevant). Others are older hands in the market (each of whom will gain differing value depending on their own particular operations in the NEM). Beyond these direct wholesale market participant, a broad (and still growing) number of other stakeholders are enjoying access to the Report Card. These include: 1) Network companies; 2) Investors, and investment banks; 3) Fuel suppliers; 4) Consultants and other services organisations; 5) Equipment suppliers to the NEM; 6) Industry organisations; 7) Educational institutions; and so on… If you work in one of the organisations above and were unaware that you already have access, simply download your copy of the Report Card here – remembering to register an account using your work email address. If you have specific questions about how the Generator Report Card might be of use to you, please call us +61 7 3368 4064 ) or tell us more of your question here . Q4) How did we prepare the Generator Report Card? In the process of completing this process, we came to the clear (and much deeper than had been the case previously realisation that the AEMO’s MMS is designed for operational purposes and is far from fit-for-purpose for completing the type of analytical assignment we took one in starting the Generator Report Card process. We knew of a number of these before, but we became aware of so many more shortcomings as we built a specific analytics-friendly post-process database we conveniently labelled “Beast”. Part of our challenge, moving forwards, relates to several aspects of making this data store accessible to our clients in various ways, and at various different levels. Q5) How to access the Generator Report Card? Last but not least, one of the most Frequently Asked Questions has all been to do with how people can access their copies of the Generator Report Card: Depending on whether your organisation already has access set up (or not) this is how you can access: This is how to Access your Copy … for those who have already ordered This is how to Place your Order … if you have not yet done so Clients should have their access to the electronic copy Generator Report Card here: Generator Report Card Download PDF You’ll need to set up your own unique log-in, using your organisational email address in order to access: it’s a 76Mb PDF so keep this in mind if on a low-speed link this process works in Chrome, Edge and Safari (but not currently in Internet Explorer). One bound hard-copy is also being supplied as well (if we have your best postal address). Given the report grew to be 530 pages long, we realised that a physical copy would also be very useful on occasions. Additional hard-copies could be supplied, for a small additional fee (basically cost recovery). It’s a simple matter of completing the Order Form and sending back to us: the Order Form for the Generator Report Card … and send back to us. We’d then: (1) Set you up with electronic access at the site above (hence be sure to specify your corporate email address); and (2) Deliver your bound-hard copy; and (3) Process your payment and provide a tax invoice. ———- … and so (with the above background completed) it will be on with the show this evening… For those who can’t make it, there’s another opportunity back in Sydney next Wednesday 21st August, where there may still be tickets available …",

    "title": "Initial thoughts and questions about last Friday’s under-frequency load shedding in Great Britain",
    "date": "12-08-2019 02:17:00 PM",
    "content": "Towards the end of the working day in Great Britain last Friday afternoon (9th August 2019), a sizeable volume of electricity consumption was cut from the electricity grid as AUFLS (automatic under-frequency load shedding) was triggered. What followed was a bit of a frenzy of interest on formal news media, and also on social media – so much so that it attracted the attention of energy sector nerds and data junkies like me as far away as Australia. Now it does occur to me that the British might view as a little strange articles like this one posted from afar: i.e. an Antipodean article, which attempts to piece together a possible sequence of events from scant data, when both: (1) The official investigation (being completed by National Grid at the request of the regulator, Ofgem) would barely be starting up and would have a long way to run; and also (2) Whilst Australians have not covered themselves in glory in this energy transition either, both: (2a) with the SA System Black event itself on 28th September 2016 – and then (perhaps moreso) (2b) with the 3-year-long-and-counting argument of who/what was at fault and what should be done about that has continued since that time . However ultimately “curiosity killed this cat” – and I reasoned that guest author Simon Bartlett already posted some initial analysis of a load shed event in Argentina , so WattClarity has some form in looking internationally (and also I thought that any offence taken, though not intended, would not be at the scale of the feelings registered in England following the come-from-behind victory in the 1st Ashes Test just a week ago) . Hence here’s a first – and probably last – grab of what I could piece together from various sources (with what seems like some key questions highlighted in this colour ). (A) Underlying fuel mix at the time of the event Being the data junkies that we are, we’ve been collecting various data feeds from electricity grids across the world for some time now (including from Elexon in the UK). In the time I have available today, I could quickly dig up this trend of aggregate output by fuel type in the UK: Note that the time shown on the axis is NEM time (i.e. UTC+10), so you need to translate back to UTC to link to the event. Noting that the cadence of this data is only every 30 minutes (far from sufficient for a detailed dive into cause-and-effect in cases like these) we can still see the general picture of the supply mix at the time of the event: 1) Aggregate output from wind had ramped up to approximately 8,000MW around the time of the event, which was a big increase from the day before. It’s not possible to discern the trip of the large offshore Hornsea Wind Farm in the data (the data is not granular enough, and the 30-minute time step is too long) but we can see some significant natural variability through the day. 2) As a result, aggregate production from gas had ramped down considerably compared to the day before. Coincidentally , supply from gas on Friday afternoon is also sitting around 8,000MW – and we can see resultant variability in gas output (at least in part compensating for the variability of wind). 3) Nuclear steady at around 6,000MW as it had been all week. 4) We see solar had peaked just below 5,000MW that day (1,000MW below the prior day) and had been ramping down through the afternoon as expected. 5) Hydro generation had ramped up in the afternoon, which I presume had been to supply a late afternoon peak in demand with the solar waning – and we also see a spike of of about 500MW around the time when we suspect the other two units tripped. 6) We see the coal unit that had been running through the week (approx 500MW output) switched off later that evening. Not included in this image, of course, are either: 1) What the level of consumption was from the grid; and 2) Imports from other grids (mainland Europe, and Ireland) at the time. Hence it is far from a complete picture. (B) What might have been the sequence of events Perhaps moreso than Australia, the UK is blessed with numerous news media outlets, and a number of them were running stories about the load shedding event through Friday evening and into the weekend. With these news media stories, and also selective noting from social media posts (where I think they seem credible – part of the ongoing challenge with social media! ) I have tried to piece together the following sequence of events: Event #1) Sudden drop in generation supply It seems pretty clear that there were two generators that came offline in quick succession. What caused them to come offline (and whether they were both trips) could not be ascertained at this point. Event 1a) Little Barford CCGT comes offline – trip, or not? From what I can gather, Little Barford is a gas-fired CCGT plant which appears to be 737MW in aggregate capacity (across 2 x GE Frame 9FA gas turbines = 241MW each) and a Stein HRSG and Alstom Steam Turbine at 256MW. From what I could find, it looks like the GTs can’t run in isolation from the steam turbine – so similar to some CCGT configurations in the NEM where there is no bypass for the GT exhaust. In this article “London Blackout Blamed on Drop in Wind and Natural-Gas Power” on the Bloomberg network I read the following: “RWE said its Little Barford gas station, which has a capacity of 730 megawatts, shut down in line with normal practice when demand hit 23,000 megawatts. National Grid and Ofgem need to investigate what was behind the wider system issues, spokesman Lothar Lambertz said.” Little Barford (in Bedford) appears to be NNW of London but east of Coventry. The Bloomberg article (nor any others that I could find) gave a specific time for when the unit came offline – but this article does helpfully include a chart highlighting a drop in output from gas which they attribute to Little Barford coming offline. I am also unclear what the reason was that the unit came offline – was it a trip, or was it some planned maintenance (would seem a little early in the evening for the unit to be coming offline given what I expect the summer demand shape to be net of supply from waning solar that afternoon)? In any case, energy grids certainly need to be resilient in the case of single large units like this coming offline. Event #1b) Hornsea Wind Farm comes offline – trip, or not? Also included in the same article from Bloomberg, we see a rapid drop in aggregate wind output of 1,000MW – which the article suggests happens at 16:50. Other sources note that this happened at the large offshore Hornsea Wind Farm, which from what I gather is a multi-stage project being developed by Orsted (DONG Energy) and Global Infrastructure Partners: Stage 1 is around 1.2GW and is operational – which implies that the drop in production was probably its whole of its output at the time. Stage 2 is around 1.8GW, but I gather still under construction Stage 3 is around 1.2GW, and I also gather under construction/development. Hornsea WF connects into the grid at the 400kV Killingholme substation and appears to be a long way north of Little Barford. An obvious question for Australian energy nerds (given what might seem some similarities to the linked sequence of events in the SA System Black event) is whether the Wind Farm coming offline was in some way linked to the earlier outage at Little Barford – e.g. perhaps by some form of “fault ride through” issue which was experienced at the sub-set of South Australian Wind Farms that tripped on voltage fluctuations. Did something similar (i.e. linked) happen with Hornsea, or were the outages entirely coincident (it seems more likely that they were related in some way)? An observation I did make in the research process was that the Hornsea turbines happen to be Siemens machines (so the same manufacturer of the turbines used at Hornsdale and Snowtown Wind Farms in South Australia – though this could well be an entirely innocent coincidence). Event #1c) Other generation units? There were some discussions I saw on social media about possibly other units being affected, but I’m not sure of the accuracy of those comments so have not included specifics here (though did want to flag them as possibility). Event #2) Frequency dropped rapidly When any generation unit comes offline (all else being equal) the system frequency will drop to some extent – those who are a little rusty might appreciate Jonathon Dyson’s handy explainer of why system frequency is so important , and also Allan O’Neil’s prior case study of what happens when a generator trips . The rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) is inversely related to the amount of inertia available in the grid (all else being equal). Hence a lower inertia grid will experience higher ROCOF – which is one of the reasons why it is of such interest as the NEM progresses through this energy transition. 1) As noted in this other article posted today the level of inertia supplied by synchronous generators in the South Australian region of the NEM had been declining in the South Australian region up until the time of the SA System Black. 2) In our Generator Report Card , we also explore what the trend is for the other mainland regions (the same calculation for Tasmania is more problematic, for reasons explained in the Report Card). Frequent WattClarity guest author Allan O’Neil obtained a dump of frequency data from www.bmreports.com over the weekend out of curiosity, from which I’ve put together the following image: We see the frequency drop from the “normal” notional 50Hz level down to a low point of 48.889Hz at 15:53:45 (which implies that the data set is published with a UTC timestamp and not adjusted for daylight savings (a sensible thing to do)). Zooming in more closely to the event time, we see two sequential low points 45 seconds apart: Note that whilst the two dips on the chart are 45 seconds apart, there is some uncertainty about the specific period between the actual lowest points, because the samples are only of 15 second cadence. Hence they might be further apart (or closer together) than 45 seconds. As noted on the image, we wonder whether the first low point is entirely the result of the drop in generation from Little Barford coming offline? The frequency drop (from above 50Hz to down near 49.1Hz within 30 seconds – and most of this within 15 seconds) at first glance seems a relatively large change, which suggests other questions about: Q1) the level of inertia in the grid at the time (noting the lower level of synchronous generation in the grid at this time, compared to others in the week); along with Q2) the operation of whatever (market-based or other?) frequency raise services were in place at the time. In the NEM these are bundled under FCAS Contingency Raise Service umbrella, but we have not invested time to learn how the arrangements work in the UK and on what time horizons. The second low point is lower – and could possibly be explained by the secondary trip of the Hornsea Wind Farm (perhaps in response to the rate of change of frequency, or some other disturbance), the effect of which would have counteracted the “raise” effects of whatever frequency support services might have been activated in response to Little Barford coming off. Event #3) Automated Under-Frequency Load Shedding (AUFLS) kicks in We presume that at around this point (e.g. frequency dropping below 49Hz perhaps) the AUFLS would have triggered, as a result of which we see the system frequency recover back to 50Hz with (lower) supply and (now lower) demand coming back into balance. This would then have allowed more time for other generators to ramp up, hence allowing all shed load to be reconnected reportedly by 18:30 local time (which would be 17:30 UTC in the frequency plots here). Interestingly, in this discussion on Twitter over the weekend and today , Glenne Drover (another energy sector nerd with not enough to do on the weekend perhaps?) comments that he had heard that load was lost in addition to what was triggered by the AUFLS protection systems. If you know of which media report this was noted in, feel free to link below as a comment? I did see this particular note on a BBC news feed at 19:25 on Friday (UK time) quoting Professor Keith Bell at University of Strathclyde noting that the frequency drop had been larger this time around than when there had been a similar loss of supply event in May 2008. One of the possible reasons for this might have been a higher ROCOF resulting from a combination of any or all of the following: 1) More supply being lost, in aggregate 2) Lower inertia in the grid (perhaps because of less synchronous generation); and 3) Lower levels of regulation FCAS support (or whatever it is called in the UK market). Another interesting contrast to what happened in the SA System Black event was that the AUFLS schemes enabled in South Australia did not have time to operate, as the rate of change of frequency in the (then islanded) South Australian grid was too fast after the Heywood interconnector tripped following the loss of supply from the group of wind farms. This is one of the reasons why level of inertia is important – though, as noted in today’s other article (and in the Generator Report Card ), we’re not implying the SA System Black would have been avoided had inertia been higher. Also worth flagging some similarity to the way in which AUFLS kicked in successfully in the NEM following the rare double-islanding on 25th August 2018 . Event #4) Ofgem asks National Grid to report on the event This article “Transport chaos across England and Wales after major power cuts” from the Guardian notes that: “On Friday night, the energy watchdog, Ofgem, warned it could take “ enforcement action ” over the outage, saying it had demanded an “urgent detailed report from National Grid so we can understand what went wrong”.” … with the ‘enforcement action’ being something quite familiar to NEM stakeholders, given court action announced by the Australian Energy Regulator only last week with respect to the SA System Black event nearly 3 years ago. Event #5) The “Energy Wars” get another boost The energy wars ( last discussed here ) don’t operate on geographical boundaries – but rather on ideological ones, ratcheted up at both ends by the far-too-influential rumps at both extremes of the Emotion-o-meter , who seem to persist with their ideological wars despite the fact that the more considered people in the middle are more concerned about that train that continues to hurtle down the track . It did not take some of the broader group of energy sector stakeholders and spectators too long to tie together these two coincident pieces of news from the UK National Grid Operator (i.e. high wind event as a share of total supply mix, followed in the same day by the load shedding): To paraphrase one of our (many!) recent ex Prime Ministers it seems likely that the high wind conditions probably won’t explain everything that happened with the load shedding events on Friday 9th August in the UK, but then they also probably don’t explain nothing as well . We will have to wait for the more considered (and resourced-up) report from National Grid ESO to understand what actually happened and why… (C) Other useful media (and other) reports In no particular order, I found these specific media reports to be of some use in trying to gain an understanding of what happened through Friday: (C1) From National Grid As the event was unfolding, and afterwards, National Grid published some useful pieces of information: 1) Julian Leslie, Head of National Control at National Grid ESO published this recorded video message here on Friday; 2) There was this statement published on Saturday ; 3) Via the BBC Radio 4, ESO Director Duncan Burt provided an explanation as part of this audio recording (skip to 1:14:26 in the recording) and note that he talks about: the automatic protection systems of the generators (i.e. plural) firing, so this would be something further to explore if time permitted. other responses (like batteries and demand response) – yet collectively insufficient to prevent the AUFLS schemes triggering. … which suggests an N-1 security standard and a single unit tripping being a “credible contingency” but not multiple units tripping. (C2) From BBC This image from the BBC provides some useful context to how the lost load was spread across England and Wales (though not Scotland?) The link in the tweet links through to this article “Major power failure affects homes and transport” on the BBC news site – and that article in turn linked through to this Live Feed of updates (which has ceased now). It was on this page that I’d seen the reference to Professor Keith Bell (image above). (C3) Other Sources What follows is a collection of sources that will be added in progressively as they come to hand: 1) On 12th August (UK time) this article “What caused the UK’s power blackout and will it happen again?” was published (by Kathryn Porter?) on the Watt-Logic energy-focused site that explains some things in more detail than I was able to uncover. 2) more, as time permits, and they come to hand… ———————— That’s all I have time to do in analysis of the UK at present – have to start preparing a couple things for the discussions in Sydney on Wednesday evening about the Generator Report Card . See you there! ——————- PS on Tuesday 20th August 2019 ——————— For those who have an interest in understanding more, National Grid has released its “Interim Report into the Low Frequency Demand Disconnection (LFDD) following Generator Trips and Frequency Excursion on 9 Aug 2019″ here . Two quick observations: #1) It was a lightning strike on the network which appears to have triggered the event; and #2) There were three (not two above) discrete losses of generation supply – independent, but commonly caused by the lightning strike: 2a) Hornsea Wind Farm 2b) Little Barford Gas CCGT 2c) A collection of smaller embedded generation. Together, this totaled almost 1,900MW – so significantly more than the 1,000MW of “spare” capacity that had been procured under normal conditions.",

    "title": "Calculated level of inertia in the South Australian grid, supplied by synchronous generation plant",
    "date": "12-08-2019 07:54:00 AM",
    "content": "Late on Friday afternoon last week there was a significant AUFLS (automated under-frequency load shedding) event in the electricity grid of Great Britain. This sparked much discussion, online and offline, over the weekend between various groups of data junkies (myself included), and led to this somewhat-related article here on WattClarity also today . Given these discussions, I thought it would be handy to publish openly here some of what we included within Theme 9 within Part 2 of the Generator Report Card for the Australian grid – as there do appear (at least on initial review) to be some significant similarities: As illustrated, in Theme 9 we explored a number of different aspects of “Emerging challenges for managing system security” in Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM), and the grid underneath that makes this market (or any form of dispatch) possible. Amongst the different aspects we explored within this theme, we reverse-engineered the instantaneous provision of inertia in the grid “naturally” provided by synchronous generation in each of the regions of the NEM. In the following chart and discussion, lifted from the Generator Report Card (p33 of part 2 for those who have their copy ) we show the MAX/AVE/MIN range apparent each month for the South Australian region: Note for those who have more of a real life than us data junkies – inertia is commonly calculated in “megawatt seconds” (i.e. MWs). Also, those who are a little rusty might appreciate Jonathon Dyson’s handy explainer of why system frequency is so important , and also Allan O’Neil’s prior case study of what happens when a generator trips . For illustrative purposes in the Report Card (and because it continues to be just so topical) we “zoomed in” to trend our calculation of the instantaneous level of inertia supplied by synchronous generation plant at the time of the SA System Black on 28th September 2016: Apologies for feeling the need to be pedantic (triggered in part because of these two very vocal and far-too-influential groups ) but I re-iterate last week’s caution that this article is posted, and the details explored within the Generator Report Card, to in no way attribute “blame” for the events leading into the SA System Black. It may well prove that there were similar contributing factors just experienced in the UK – though one would need to delve into the high-speed sub-second data from measurement points across the grid to really discern this. We’re sure that National Grid in the UK will be starting to do this for their report to Ofgem. ——————————– For those who wish to discuss this further, or more generally explore the insights shared in the Generator Report Card, these events in Sydney on Wednesday this week and Wednesday next week would be a good opportunity (or just let us know via this feedback form ). … and finally: 1) Those who already have access can download the Report Card here ; and 2) Those who do not access can arrange this by returning the Order Form to us .",

    "title": "Heightened Risk an increasing feature in the NEM these days…",
    "date": "09-08-2019 02:15:00 PM",
    "content": "Busy times in the NEM currently, with 3 articles already within 24 hours and this one making 4 (for a “spare time” commentary site, that might almost make a record?). This morning I noted Angela Macdonald-Smith and Mark Ludlow writing in the AFR that “Risks take the shine off solar” , with the article referencing the work we have done in compiling the Generator Report Card – in collaboration with Jonathon Dyson and his Greenview team, and with additional assistance from a range of other people as well . The online article talks about “threats” whereas the print article used the word “risk” on a number of occasions. In Theme 2 within Part 2 of our Generator Report Card , we explore a number of different dimensions of this risk (and also elsewhere, like in Theme 9 where we explore implications for System Security). Coincidentally today, our NEMwatch dashboard presented us with an ever-present reminder of one aspect of this risk – here in the 13:55 dispatch interval down at –$1,000/MWh in South Australia : For frequent NEM watchers like us, we might all have become a little more blasé about dispatch interval prices down at the Market Price Floor of –$1,000/MWh. However (as noted on this image) what about seeing that the time-weighted average dispatch price in South Australia today across all 14 hours to 13:55 was down below –$20/MWh …. and it has been falling over recent hours! Risky business indeed… ————- Don’t forget that Sydneysiders have these two opportunities during August to meet with us and talk through what’s in the Generator Report Card – and you can: (a) download the report here , for those who have access; and (b) order your copy here , if you don’t. ————- PS on Sunday 11th August Following publishing this article on Friday afternoon, I also posted a short note here on LinkedIn noting that: “I don’t think I can ever remember seeing a *daily average* price down below $0/MWh at 14:00 in the afternoon…”. True to form for an industry full of data junkies (like myself) Josh Stabler did point out an outcome where daily (time-weighted) average price in South Australia did drop down to –$103.81/MWh for the whole day. Josh’s point, and some other questions I received from others, prompted me to power up NEMreview v6 to quickly generate a trend (which I posted on LinkedIn that afternoon ) trend average price for each day from 1st January 2010 (which i really should have been done before I posted in the first place!). Here’s the same chart updated today to include the day’s results also for Friday 9th and Saturday 10th August: As we can see over this date range of almost 10 years: Observation #1 = there were a number of days where the daily average spot price was below $0/MWh, with most of these being prior to 2013: 1a) There were 15 days below $0/MWh in South Australia: (i) with 30th June 2012 being most severe, down at –$103.16/MWh on 30th June 2012, just before the Carbon Tax period started Note that this number is slightly different than what Josh noted LinkedIn (i.e. $103.81/MWh) which appears to be because of an easy-to-make error Josh made in treating the price for 00:00 on 20th June 2012 as pertaining to the 20th June (whereas it’s the price for the last half hour on the prior day). (ii) and the most recent period being 11th July 2019, down at –13.03/MWh (iii) only four days since 2012 1b) There were also 1 instance in QLD, 2 instances in VIC and 9 instances in TAS Observation #2 = the way the rest of Friday panned out, the average price for the day actually ended up being above $0/MWh in South Australia, due to some volatility later in that day.",

    "content": "Many thanks to the great many people who have met with us over the past two months following the release of our Generator Report Card , which we developed in collaboration with the team at Greenview Strategic Consulting and with the assistance of a broader range of people . Thanks especially to those who shared their feedback, and asked their questions, at our recent Q&A events in Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney. Two other independent organisations have also organised events at which they have asked us to speak a little about some of the main lessons we’ve learnt through the process of putting the Generator Report Card together. Both are in Sydney in the coming weeks, and both organisations have noted that they are happy for us to invite you along in this way: Wednesday 14th August from 17:15 (already held) Australian Institute of Energy – Sydney CBD Wednesday 21st August from 16:30 Australian Energy Council – Sydney CBD This event has now been held, with some notes from the event made here on WattClarity. The Australian Energy Council has organised this event for their members (but are happy for others to come along as well): Details of the AEC Event … including how to register. Both organisations operate in the Australian energy sector, but have different constituents – hence I would expect a slightly different audience mix. Both Jonathon Dyson and I are keen to meet with both : (A) Any of the hundreds of people across the scores of organisations who have already purchased the Report Card, hence can download from here with an account created with their organisational email address; and (B) Others who are curious about the Report Card (but have not yet submitted their order ) hence would like to come along and learn a bit more, and perhaps ask questions. We’d look forward to seeing you on Wednesday 14th August, or Wednesday 21st August, in Sydney.",

    "title": "Two different storm warnings in South Australia – one literal, and one metaphorical",
    "date": "08-08-2019 10:08:00 PM",
    "content": "APOLOGY. Another late post to follow yesterday’s, so please excuse any lack of clarity (and especially errors) in what follows… Quite coincident today that there are effectively two different types of storm warnings present affecting the South Australian region (amongst others) of the National Electricity Market – one literal, and one figurative: (A) The literal storm warning At 13:11 today the Bureau of Meteorology issued Severe Weather Warning IDS21037 noting “damaging, locally destructive winds” across much of the state: Taking this into account, AEMO published Market Notice 69177 at 11:51 of a “Protected Event” because of a risk of “the loss of multiple transmission elements causing generation disconnection in the South Australia region during periods where destructive wind conditions are forecast by the Bureau of Meteorology.” As noted here in the snapshot from ez2view at 14:35 this afternoon, the AEMO invoked Constraint Set “I-VS_250” which operates with Constraint Equation “VS_250” to limit the maximum flow west from Victoria into South Australia to no more than 250MW (i.e. providing headroom for a rapid increase in flow west should generation disconnect in South Australia, dropping the frequency as a result). We see that the dispatched flow is heading east on the Heywood interconnector at the time, with the high wind speeds powering most wind farms up near their maximum capacities: Note that some wind farms (along with other assets) are being limited by the “S>>PARB_RBTU_WEWT” constraint equation, related to the trip of Robertstown-Tungkillo 275kV line. The affected elements are shown with “+” and “-” symbols on the schematic. For those a little rusty, Jonathon Dyson’s introduction to (frequency responses and) FCAS is a useful refresher to understanding how frequency responds to sudden changes to supply (or demand). Intentionally limiting the interconnector flow in advance of a possible contingency event (e.g. some operational generators in SA tripping for reasons related to the high wind speeds, directly or indirectly) is one of the approaches that has been used more frequently in the wash-up following the SA System Black back on 28th September 2016. We need to keep in mind that this does have a cost (i.e. leading to more expensive generation operating in some instances), but the decision has been made that this cost is outweighed by the benefits of added system security: The list of references to the SA System Black provided here might be useful to some readers – and please add comments on that page if you know of others . (B) The metaphorical storm warning Coincident with the current-day physical system storm warning today, yesterday we saw notice of another (bigger) storm brewing, this time in a figurative sense , with the announcement that AER has commenced proceedings in the Federal Court against four wind farm operators for alleged breaches of the National Electricity Rules (NER). Proceedings have been brought against subsidiaries of: AGL Energy Limited (ASX: AGL) in relation to the Hallett 1, Hallett 2, Hallett 4 and Hallett 5 Wind Farms (Suzlon turbines); Neoen SA in relation to the Hornsdale Wind Farm (Siemens turbines); Pacific Hydro Pty Ltd in relation to the Clements Gap Wind Farm (Suzlon turbines); and Tilt Renewables Limited (ASX: TLT) in relation to the Snowtown 2 Wind Farm (comprising Snowtown Wind Farm Stage 2 North and Snowtown Stage 2 South Wind Farm) – Siemens turbines. This decision has certainly surprised many people for a number of reasons – including because of what’s been inferred from the “we do not intend to take formal enforcement action in respect of this matters” statement from the AER itself in the Executive Summary of their their own “The Black System Event Compliance Report” published 9 months earlier on 14th December 2018: Note that various others have inferred, with respect to this AER statement: Caveat #1) That this statement seems to refer to AEMO only (given that it is the primary actor mentioned in the paragraphs above); and, more significantly; Caveat #2) That this event report covered the Pre-event, System Restoration, and Market Suspension aspects surrounding the 28 September 2016 event – but not the Event itself (they note, on the page before that “The AER’s work surrounding the actual Event is ongoing and is therefore not a focus of this report.” ) 2a) I am currently unaware of an AER Report on the Event itself being published in the 9 months since the release of this report; 2b) It would seem logical (with court action proceeding) that this report should be available at the same time? 2c) If anyone knows where it is, I would like to link it into this list of key reference documents about the SA System Black (so please contact me directly, or leave a comment on that page). Now let me be clear that I am not in the best place ( nor am I the best person) to be commenting on the court action itself or the specific parties involved – hence I am intentionally NOT doing so in the following comments. Readers should take the clear hint also not to read anything like that into the following … The metaphorical storm clouds that are gathering seem, to me, to be massing for storms at two different levels: (B1) Re-ignition of “the Energy Wars” In reality they never really went away, though perhaps the atmosphere did cool a little after the crescendo of that particular RET Review . However it’s been only 36 hours or so since the publication of the AER announcement, and already I’m sensing a marked escalation of thunder and lightning amongst a broad group of commentary in mainstream media, in specialist niche media brands (i.e. energy sector focused, like WattClarity ), and in an eclectic assortment of corners of social media… This time it might even be worse, in a way: (a) With a federal coalition government (with certain elements particularly re-energised after winning the “unwinnable” election) and a deflated opposition licking its wounds after losing the same; and (b) Throwing in an enquiry into nuclear just to make the mixture truly challenging. Continuing with the electrical analogies, I expect that after much heat and noise has been generated in the process, we’ll look back (once again) and see that not much useful work will have been actually been performed . As you can probably tell, I’m pretty pessimistic about this storm – given the motley collection we have of emperors with no clothes , our own confused crowd of us as the voting public , and a the far-too-influential rumps at both extremes of the Emotion-o-meter , whilst all the while that train continues hurtling down the track . (B2) A reasoned discussion (rather than a religious battle, I would hope) about Generator Performance Standards There is a lower altitude storm that is also amassing that might actually end up doing something useful – in terms of washing away much obscurity and confusion relating to the purpose, the nature, and the content of Generator Performance Standards. Again note that: 1) I am not commenting about the specific nature of the court action itself, 2) Nor am I commenting about the actors involved; 3) Nor am I commenting about the System Black event …. but it does occur to me that there may be a flow-on benefit in this particular storm, if it leads to a genuinely reasoned and detailed discussion (and heightened awareness) about the specifics of what we need to expect that generators will be able to provide (and the standards under which they do this) into the future of our energy transition . Perhaps I am naively optimistic about what might actually be achieved outside of the attention of the broader gaggle of stakeholders that seem to be swarming into the energy sector? It was only in yesterday’s article that I noted that we’d explored (in Theme 14 within Part 2 of the Generator Report Card ) how we all need much better mental models of both the electricity grid and its intertwined (but still distinct) electricity market. The ones we have grown up with are, even if we’ve been in the industry for decades, are struggling to keep up with the growing complexities. This is particularly challenging for new entrants : (a) At the downright scary end of the spectrum, we have been told stories of prospective generators who have been confused between the NEM’s GPS (i.e. Generator Performance Standards) and the more widespread use of GPS (Global Positioning System) – even at the point where their projects had secured significant funding (from who?!) and were into construction. Would be downright funny if it was not so scary… (b) In Theme 5 within Part 2 of our Generator Report Card , we explore how there’s an emerging schism between “us” and “them” in the NEM that is leading to a growing gap in organisational capability (as distinct from capacity ) amongst stakeholders in the NEM. We hypothesise that this is due, at least in part, because of the specific mechanisms used to support “Anytime/Anywhere Energy” . Let’s hope that the people most affected in this particular storm can approach it with a mindset of building a NEM 2.0 that actually delivers an energy transition that works (as distinct from what we’ve been witnessing over the past 10-15 years). I’ll be watching this particular storm with interest (whilst trying to avoid being pounded ‘cats and dogs’ in the Energy War Storm)…",

    "title": "Questions and Observations–about AGL’s Liddell, Torrens A (and Loy Yang A) stations",
    "date": "07-08-2019 07:56:00 PM",
    "content": "APOLOGY. It’s getting late today, but I really have to post this now in order to get back to other commitments in the morning. Hence I do apologise for any lack of clarity (or ideas not fully thought through) – and, of course, mistakes – in the following… Last week on Friday 2nd August (ironically in the same week as the CEC’s Clean Energy Summit on Tuesday/Wednesday) we noted the decision made by AGL Energy: to slightly extend the operations of the Liddell Power Station (coal-fired) in NSW past the previously noted retirement date of 2022 (for three units into 2023); and also to delay the closure of Torrens A (gas-fired) station in South Australia until after summer 2019-20. This was noted in this announcement to the ASX and media by the company – and then picked up and discussed on that day in various news media outlets (including Angela Macdonald-Smith in the AFR , Perry Williams and Olivia Caisley in the Australian , by Fergus Hunter and Peter Hannam in the SMH/Age , and by Michael Mazengarb and Sophie Vorrath on RenewEconomy ). (A) Vision clouded by the #coalfail meme? Sadly, what I observed via social media following the AGL announcement seemed be to almost automated reactions conditioned to occur following the long, concerted and vocal campaign under the #coalfail meme. Some of the responses (which are not worth linking to here, as they would just compound the distraction) seemed to imply that because both plants are old, and hence implicitly unreliable because of age, extending their operations over summer 2019-20 (Torrens A) and summer 2022-23 (Liddell) might actually make the situation worse than it would otherwise be if the extension decisions had not been made. These reactions were most prolific (from what I saw) in relation to the decision at Liddell – which is I presume at least in part because it’s coal and not gas, and was a core focus of the stoush between (former CEO) Andy Vesey and the federal government back at the time of the initial closure announcement. These reactions seem to me to be just another symptom of what I noted last year as a general malaise of “not focusing on the real problems” (Villain no5) – at least in part because of the yawning gap in our energy literacy (Villain no4). Given the thinking space afforded by our focused efforts with respect to the Generator Report Card , we were able to expand on this thinking inside the report card with a broader/deeper observation that the “Transitional challenges require greatly enhanced analytical capability” – so much so that we explicitly discuss this observation over several pages at Theme 14 within Part 2 of the Report itself: TO BE CONTINUED LATER… As time permits I will post more separately about the aspects of the “dependability” of the Liddell power station itself, sourcing data compiled for our Generator Report Card. However I stress that there seem to be more pressing questions currently than exploring #coalfail in relation to Liddell. (B) More important observations/questions … in my view Since the AGL announcement there have been a number of questions buzzing around in my head – so, in between other commitments, I’ve been trying to puzzle through – so I will try to outline some of these below (with more to come as time permits)… Q1) What’s the underlying reasoning behind the brief extensions? It’s important to keep in mind that the AGL notice pertained to two different stations and two different timeframes (though this might be crowded out if you just tuned into the push-back against Liddell extension). The AGL release was not long on detail, so I have annotated this with a few comments below: As both closures are real-life examples we should be learning from in terms of charting the broader energy transition (phasing legacy assets out, and new assets in), it seems to me that we should be seeking to understand as much as we can about what’s going on in this live-line experiment . Q2) What’s the story for summer 2019-20? There are a few moving parts with respect to summer 2019-20, a number of which fall into the AGL portfolio (which is a story in and of itself, in terms of accessibility of information): Moving Part #1 = we have the decision above to ask for – though not yet confirm – a delay to the scheduled closure of the Torrens A units to beef up dispatchable capacity available in the South Australian region. Moving Part #2 = we have the linked commissioning of the (somewhat replacement) Barkers Inlet station in South Australia in the same vicinity. Moving Part #3 = we have the very significant extended outage at Loy Yang A2 in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria: 3a) I posted an initial note about this here in June after an AGL notice to the ASX and then Allan O’Neil followed up with more details on 14th June . 3b) Given the significance of the asset to AGL, the fact that there has not been any further updat e since that time leads me to presume that there are people at AGL running around quite stressed at the moment, trying to work out how they can possibly repair the unit in the shortest possible time (by repairing the existing generator, beg/borrow/buy another existing generator from somewhere else around the world, or manufacturing a new one (hopefully unnecessary, as it might take years to secure a slot, overcome technical issues with the manufacturer effectively not existing anymore and so on)) – my sense is that “no news means bad news ” Moving Part #4 = we also have the extended outage at Mortlake unit 2 close to the VIC-SA border – which I posted about on 9th July and then Allan O’Neil followed up with more on 23rd July . Given that we’re now into August, this means only a few months away from summer-induced demand peaks (and high-temperature limitations on almost all types of electrical assets ( including significant effect on some wind farms! ), hence I would expect that there will be people at the AEMO who’d be getting nervous about all of this and contemplating pulling the trigger on mechanisms like the Reserve Trader – which was in place for summer 2017-18 (though not used) and summer 2018-19 (and used on January 24th and 25th 2019 ). Using our ez2view software (including the Time-Travel functionality) I have tried to piece together some view of what’s been happening in the broader SA region, both in terms of visibility of prices of ASX futures (Base for SA) and also what the AEMO is saying in MT PASA focused on the coming summer. Here’s a view from earlier this afternoon: Here’s the same chart (showing exactly the same data series) time-travelled back 2 weeks (to 24th July, so before the 29th update of the Generator Information Page shown below, and before the AGL announcement on 2nd August). Note no change in the forecasts for demand or available generation in the SA region (and yet we see that the level of Unserved Energy forecast for the month of January 2020 has grown in between this earlier update and the one (further above) 2 weeks later on 7th August). Tracking further back (to 1st May) we see that the forecasts for available generation and demand have been quite stable – and yet back then there was much less Unserved Energy forecast back then (and the futures price for Q1 2020 was understandably lower). This helps to highlight that AEMO’s expectations of unserved energy in the South Australian region are increasing (now even under a 50% POE scenario) – even though assumptions about demand and supply in the region have not changed. Hence this suggests either/both: (a) something happening in neighbouring VIC, or further; or/and (b) something different coming out of the Monte-Carlo model. Q3) What’s the story for summer 2022-23? Into the AEMO mix also throw the annual update to the Electricity Statement of Opportunities for 2019, due in the next couple weeks – which I expect will contain some white-knuckle periods in the forecast horizon (and possibly also call into action the Retailer Reliability Obligatio n). In that framework, I am very curious about the “independent engineering assessment” AGL talks about in their notice. Those three words could be inferred as meaning pretty much anything, but I do have a few specific questions: Q3a) What happened to the replacement capacity that Vesey was so public about? In the very public stoush of a couple years ago, Andy Vesey was quite vocal about sufficient replacement plant being in place in time for Liddell to retire in 2022: (a) What happened to that – is it merely delayed (by how long?) or is something larger at work? (b) Was the “Vesey the Salesman” over-optimistic on what would be done by when, with the remaining people now at AGL a little more realistic about what could be done and by when? Q3b) Heaven forbid, there’s no risk of Loy Yang A2 being out that long? The horrid thought did occur to me (and perhaps to others as well) that part of the thinking might pertain to a risk that AGL need to contract to build a new generator to replace the damage one, with some difficulty in obtaining a slot at GE or somewhere else, and a suitable design (given the age of the unit, and the fact that Brown-Boveri does not exist anymore). In the absence of any update from AGL, I wonder who else has had that horrid thought … Now AEMO’s MT PASA window currently only extends out 2 years into the future, and generator availability is only published on an aggregated-to-region basis currently. Hence the only AEMO resource I know of that can be somewhat useful at the current point (until the ESOO comes out, and then that is only annual anyway) is this Generator Information Page . However you’ll note that the most recent update there currently is one from Monday last week (i.e. 29th July before the AGL announcement): Hence it is understandable here that the XLSX file provided still shows the schedule at the time that Liddell was to be closed before summer 2022-23: No update, in this file (which was published before the AGL announcement) to reflect the longer run time – and also no update about Torrens A and Barkers Inlet (and that file still showed the assumption that Loy Yang A2 would be back by summer 2019-20). How MT PASA evolves (and the ASX contract pricing with it) in the next few weeks will be of considerable interest…. (C) We can do better, in terms of visibility – we need to! At this point I am running out of time this evening, but wanted to note that the ASX Futures Contracts (out to Q2 2023) will have traded since AGL’s announcement last Friday and yet (to my knowledge – please let me know if I am wrong!) there is no corresponding AEMO information published about the physical market that maps to the markets consensus expectations of what the Liddell extensions (and whatever drove them!) mean in financial terms. Almost in parallel with these current developments in the market, I’ve been aware of this Rule Change proposal submitted by ERM Power to improve the transparency and extend the duration of MT PASA . Sounds to me like an almost universally beneficial change (though of course we are already working through a significant backlog of information system changes following from Five Minute Settlement and so on). Stay tuned for the publication of the ESOO in the next couple weeks (and, I expect, some form of triggering of the Retailer Reliability Obligation ). This will make it even more important that we get better visibility into the future, which is: 1) Longer range (beyond 2 years) 2) More granular (down to the day, like in MT PASA) 3) Updated more frequently (every 3 hours, like in MT PASA availability); and 4) Showing visibility down to the DUID level. Sorry I don’t have more to note this evening (and also apologies that this rushed article is not as coherent as I would like it to be).",

    "title": "Assessing the diversity of intermittent (wind and solar output) as one piece of analysis in the Generator Report Card",
    "date": "26-07-2019 05:29:00 PM",
    "content": "Over on RenewEconomy today, David Leitch of ITK has posted some analysis here using our NEMreview software to compare actual outputs of wind farms through the past 9 months (including Mt Emerald Wind Farm as the first wind farm in Queensland, thousands of kilometres away from the wind farms clumped together in the south-eastern corner of the NEM). This coincided with a conversation I had earlier today with a client about the same subject matter (diversity of intermittent supplies). In Theme 10 within Part 2 of our Generator Report Card 2018 , we published the results of some significant analysis we performed, which would augment the results that David has presented there for RenewEconomy readers. However it turns out I can’t add in images there anymore – so it occurred to me to also copy the three main points in here for WattClarity readers: 1) Readers need to understand the difference between three types of outcomes (high correlation, randomness and high anti-correlation), and why randomness is not the ideal outcome we would be hoping for. See the table cut from the Report Card: 2) In the GRC2018 , we investigated displayed degrees of correlation between all wind and solar plant (in Renewable Energy Zones) over a number of years to 31st December 2018. This needs to be done at a dispatch interval basis from the perspective price outcomes, constrained outcomes, firmness and so on (though chunking up to days or larger time slices would help in understanding energy balance and storage requirements and so on). 3) We also explored hypothetical wind production across all Renewable Energy Zones using 3 years of granular (i.e. close to 5-minute) historical wind speed readings in those REZ. We hope that the results presented in the Generator Report Card can raise the level of awareness of what’s actually happening (and possible) in order that we can move on to explore approaches that will actually help the energy transition succeed – rather than just re-hashing old debates. From an “ideal outcome” point of view, “just” randomness is not enough . PS1 Diversity is not a magic wand On 24th May 2020 we shared more from the GRC2018 in the article ‘Villain no 6d – Diversity is not a magic wand’ :",

    "title": "War of Losses",
    "date": "26-07-2019 08:41:00 AM",
    "content": "Firstly thanks Paul McArdle for the invite to be today’s guest author. My interest in Marginal Loss Factors (MLF) is because my view is the existing rules are outdated and not fit for purpose. I have proposed several suggestions for rule enhancements as the current rules are resulting in high inaccuracies and hence are distorting the market though inefficiencies in operational and investment decision making. The rule changes are here on the AEMC website . These can be summarised as follows 1. Currently the generators do not receive any allocation of the bucket of money left over each year called “Int ra -Regional Settlements Residue” (IRSRs) that accrues due to MLF inaccuracies. Note don’t confuse this with “Int er -Regional Settlements Residue” which is the other bucket of money left over due to the difference between state pricing. The Int ra bucket of money is handed entirely to the TNSP to give back to TUOS customers. I have proposed to share this bucket fairly with generators who are also paying dearly for inaccurate MLFs. 2. We should also reduce the size of the bucket of money every year by half by using average or compressed loss factors (and not Marginal) as these better represent true losses. True engineering losses on the grid are not marginal as this is an economic theory (and based on extremes) instead based on averages. Hence the current rule (aligned to marginal price setter) over-recovers. The marginal loss calculation also uses the formula Losses = Current ^2 X Resistance This is fine for a simple DC circuit however using this calculation for losses in the NEM is simply bogus and defies reality. Our complex power transmission system is AC and flows two way. We should be measuring electricity in vs energy out at every point in the system to see actual losses. Arguments over electrical losses aren’t new as good nerds know from the famous “war of currents” fought between Nickola Tesla (AC) and Thomas Edison (DC) over whose electrical system would power the world. Eventually Tesla won based on the fact his AC system had less losses. Today there is a similar but different “war of losses” being argued. I have argued over the past year that our current MLF framework is out of date and not fit for purpose. This is evident though the increase in the IRSR as a lagging indicator of the increasing inaccuracies. The IRSR can be thought of as the cumulative error that arises because actual losses (average) on a system are half marginal losses (MLF) by definition. The error also arises because actual generation and load patterns change from year to year yet MLF are static and forecast a year in advance. For example thermal generators may generate more or less as a result of changing fuel costs, market prices or unplanned outages. Turning back the clock, it is also worth noting that as generation in the NEM is dispatched optimally based on marginal costing, so it’s understandable how economists win the argument that transmission should be costed marginally as well. However I do have an issue saying in one breath “Losses are real” and then pointing to our present economic construct based on a simple one way DC circuit law of physics. When we strive for perfect information in every other aspect of the electricity supply chain to create economic efficiency, why neglect transmission? Why aren’t the actual AC transmission loss calculations (including my personal favourite – Corona losses) visible to market participants and who is best place to manage transmission loss risk? For true economic efficiency, risk should sit with those best placed to manage. Is this generators, TNSP or customers? Hence the war and starting to feel like a little bit of history repeating Edison vs Tesla. Enough of that, back to the IRSR which has been a significant and growing amount over the past few years, highlighting inaccuracy due to the current MLF process. For the last two years in QLD this has amounted to $82M per year with the trend rising in each region (excluding SA). Negative IRSR generally will occur when there are extreme price event (high demand) in any region due to the asymmetric nature of spot prices (and windfall gains by generators relative to the market settlement). I can’t explain why the spikes in 07 however the spike in 17 seems to correlate to the forecast start of new renewable generation.

    "title": "Keeping the lights on this summer – possible impact of the Loy Yang A2 and Mortlake outages",
    "date": "23-07-2019 03:02:00 PM",
    "content": "Two large thermal generating units in Victoria with combined capacity of over 800 MW have recently experienced major electrical faults each requiring many months to repair. Previous WattClarity posts have covered initial assessments of the outages of AGL’s 530 MW Loy Yang A unit 2 (followed up here ), and at Origin’s 283 MW Mortlake unit 2 . Announced return-to-service dates for both units fall in December, but with extensive and complex repairs required, there are inevitable risks of slippage in these targets. The affected units provide about 7% of Victorian large-scale generating capacity and nearly 9% of the state’s dispatchable capacity, so there are valid concerns about impacts on supply reliability over summer 2019-20 given the already tight supply-demand balance and the load shedding required in Victoria last summer during two days of very high temperatures and generator failures . In this post we’ll update some of the forward market data reflecting possible impacts on reliability and electricity prices, and compare Victoria’s position lacking these two units with the situation that transpired in January this year. In the earlier post on projected impacts of the Loy Yang A2 outage I included the following chart drawn from AEMO’s MTPASA projections for supply-demand balance: The corresponding current outlook is shown in the following chart, and a close comparison between the two shows increases in the assessed risk of load shedding (“Loss of Load Probability” or LoLP, as well as increases in possible Unserved Energy – the grey columns in the chart) in the mid-November to mid-December period, driven by the absence of Mortlake unit 2 until late December, overlying the LYA2 outage and previously scheduled pre-summer outages at other generators. The final step up seen in the black capacity line below is the target return to service date for Mortlake 2; it is less clear exactly when LYA2 is scheduled to return in this view (AEMO does not publish individual unit availability data, only aggregate regional levels): Extending the chart to include the January-March 2020 quarter, we see that even after the projected returns to service of the Loy Yang A and Mortlake units, significantly higher reliability risks appear in January and February 2020, driven by the higher potential maximum demands in the peak summer period: In other words, mid-summer remains the key period of supply-demand tightness in the Victorian region, although the outages at Loy Yang A and Mortlake have increased the risks in the event of high temperatures and demands occurring in late November and December. Of course if the returns to service of either or both of these units were significantly delayed into January or February, then reliability risks in mid-summer would escalate substantially – I’ll return to this point later. The charts above illustrate AEMO’s assessment of the physical supply-demand balance outlook; market participants’ views are in part captured by the dynamics of forward prices for electricity contracts over summer, summarised in the following price chart from ez2view: Key takeouts from this chart are that: Baseload and cap contract prices for Q3 (July-September) 2019 initially showed some reaction to the outages but have essentially returned to their prior levels, Contract prices for Q4 2019 have increased by about $9-10/MWh (baseload) and $4-5/MWh (caps), Contract prices for Q1 2020 have increased by $10-$15/MWh, even though both damaged units are targeted for return to service prior to January, The lift in Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 prices largely preceded the outage at Mortlake – while there were short term jumps in prices for all contracts shown after information on the severity of the damage and repair time were disclosed, prices have largely retraced over the following two weeks As a reference point for the forward price levels charted, Victorian spot prices for Q1 2019 averaged $165.8/MWh of which $51.1/MWh was associated with the “cap value” of spot prices in excess of $300/MWh. Most ($41/MWh) of this cap value arose over the two days of load-shedding experienced on the 24th and 25th of January, when spot prices reached the then-prevailing Market Price Cap of $14,500/MWh for several hours. Q1 2020 Victorian forward prices for baseload contracts at close to $150/MWh and caps at close to $50/MWh could therefore be interpreted as a market consensus that supply-demand tightness next summer could lead to events similar to those seen in January this year. Consistent with AEMO’s assessment of lower and less extended risks to supply reliability in Q4 2019, forward prices for that quarter are significantly lower, despite the absence of LYA2 and Mortlake 2 for most of the quarter. Concentrating on Q1 2020, it is possible that the recent increases in forward prices reflect a combination of market participants: fearing that the Loy Yang A and Mortlake outages will extend into the higher risk peak summer period, directly increasing the chance of load-shedding and extreme prices, focusing their attention more generally on the outlook for summer reliability and the chance of plant outages, even if repairs at Loy Yang A and Mortlake are completed on target There isn’t space in this post for a deep analysis of the events of last summer, in particular January 24-25 in Victoria (see AEMO’s very detailed report ), but I thought it would be useful to close with a chart summarising performance of the Victorian thermal generation fleet (coal and gas-fired units) over those two days of very high temperatures and demand, just to put into perspective the size of the outages under discussion in this article: This chart shows that on the first day of load reduction / shedding, when temperatures peaked at over 47 degrees in Adelaide and 41 in Melbourne, two large thermal units with combined capacity of 940 MW were unavailable due to repair work, and there were further capacity deratings of around 400 MW at units online. By 25th January when Melbourne reached 43 degrees (46 in some suburbs) a further coal fired unit had gone offline and larger deratings were experienced across the remaining coal and gas fleet. A fourth large unit failed later on 25th January but this happened after a cool change had lowered demand and load-shedding had ended. While there has been new renewable capacity commissioned in Victoria and South Australia since last summer and more is in the pipeline, this may contribute little additional supply at a time of peak demand stress. The only new dispatchable capacity which may be online is at AGL’s Barker Inlet station in South Australia (up to ~200 MW in late 2019 or early 2020). Were similarly extreme temperature and demand conditions to recur this coming summer and repairs at Loy Yang A2 and Mortlake 2 had not been completed, then supply-demand balance could be broadly similar to that seen on 24 January. Of course if other thermal units failed, supply would be lower, whereas if better wind conditions prevailed (unlike January 24th when wind strength fell away over the evening peak), supply-demand balance would improve. Given the importance of having maximum levels of dispatchable capacity available to meet extreme summer demands in Victoria and South Australia, should these eventuate, the progress of repairs and likely return to service dates for Loy Yang A unit 2 and Mortlake unit 2 will remain of critical interest to everyone involved in or affected by the market. We’ll continue to monitor developments here on WattClarity. ——————————————- About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

    "content": "No time today to delve into detail, but a few phone calls and messages prompted a quick look at Mortlake unit 2 outage which began yesterday morning.

    "date": "27-06-2019 03:23:00 PM",
    "content": "Today I had the pleasure of presenting at the Solar Asset Management conference in Sydney, concentrating on the key issues around storage and curtailment, a hot topic for all fuel types but especially utility scale solar. Given the recent findings from the Generator Report Card , I thought I would also share the presentation here given the cross-over in content and findings. In taking a birds eye view on recent operations for solar, the findings of the Generator Report Card helped considerably, highlighting just how much constraints have already been occurring, not just what may happen in the some way-off future. Pages 3 and 4 of the slide deck (here) were straight out of the GRC. When I reflected on the capacity factors that we have been seeing in the past 12-18 months, it naturally focussed my attention on why the generation levels are the way they are. And like all good energy traders, it led me to network constraints and pricing. Slide 5 highlights that, once we remove many of the commissioning and hard/soft ramping constraints associated with typical operations, there are two main constraints affecting NSW and QLD solar assets over the months in 2019: system normal (voltage management) in NSW, and network outage constraints in QLD. As I reflected on that further, while outage constraints would have been suspected to cause some issues (albeit rarely), I suspect many would not be suspecting constraints would curtail generation under system Normal constraints in the middle of the day, even without the impacts of duck curves or pricing (as is occurring in SA today!). I then took this to the next level to understand these constraints impact on dispatch outcomes, and the effective nodal price or curtailed price jumped out as something requiring further investigation. Slide 6 highlights the effective average dispatch price at the node that the generators needed to be bid below the prevailing RRP in order to ensure their generation was dispatched, despite the QLD or NSW RRP potentially still being highly positive. When this type of assessment, just for 2019 was, done, it became easier to see that the constraining operations are well and truly underway . I then drew the conclusion that with the ever changing energy landscape, the operations of the incumbents, new entrants and impending participants will all need to progressively adapt and adjust with close-in monitoring of dispatch outcomes, and that the resulting market outcomes will start to push and develop more sophisticated generator setups such as pure solar/battery and wind/battery hybrids. With these increased levels of close-in monitoring , automated bidding and new types of generators that can start to move and optimise generation that would otherwise have been curtailed, not to mention changes to 5 minute settlement that is now just 2 years away, there is no doubt what has happened in the past will not be the future. The ‘set and forget’ generator will become a thing of the past. ————————————– About our Guest Author Jonathon has nearly 20 years practical experience in the Australian NEM, having held senior operational and trading roles in participant organisations and now as the Director of a specialist market consulting organisation, with a specific focus on renewable energy integration.

    "title": "Which was that ‘mystery DUID’ that apparently ‘can’t stand the heat’*?",
    "date": "26-06-2019 09:06:00 AM",
    "content": "* Please note that I’m not a big fan of terms like ‘can’t stand the heat’ as they tend to evoke emotional responses (which I can understand might be the objective for others). Given the growing complexities (and risks) inherent in delivering an energy transition that actually works, it seems to me that we’d be better off staying rational and objective with respect to a holistic view what the operational data is actually telling us – which is certainly what we’ve striven to do in preparing the Generator Report Card . ——————————— Frequent readers might remember that in April I posed a challenge for NEM observers in terms of guessing** which unit I’d featured as a “mystery DUID” was so significantly affected in output such that: (a) its capability (in terms of peak output) was seen to start to decline from around 30 degrees local to the unit, (b) with the capacity limitation severe from around 37 degrees Celcius . ** or statistically identifying, for those with the means and motivation Here’s the output boundary curve for that “mystery DUID” again: Since the release of the Generator Report Card on 31st May , I’ve received a few friendly nudges from people who were curious about which generator was the one featured here. Those with their own copy of the Generator Report Card can see the result above on Page 85 in Part 4 (along with the results for the majority of the units in the cohort of similar units under the relevant Fuel Type in Part 4). I’m not going to share all those data points here today, but am happy to talk about this particular unit featured above… (A) Clarifying what the chart shows As discussed back in April, one piece of analysis we performed in compiling the Generator Report Card was: Step 1 = to map each DUID to nearest BOM weather measurement station for which we have good data for the three year period 2016, 2017 and 2018 (as a result of this exercise, the farthest separation was something like 100km for some generator in Western Queensland – I believe this was Barcaldine). Step 2 = with this mapping in place, assemble 2 linked series of data on a 5-minute basis (Output and Local Temperature). Step 3 = normalise the instantaneous Output to instantaneous Capacity Factor, for easier comparability across all units. Step 4 = for a given DUID, assemble a distribution of instantaneous Capacity Factor for each degree of Local Temperature. Step 5 = choose the largest value of instantaneous Capacity Factor in each degree of Local Temperature; and Step 6 = hence produce an “Output Boundary Curve” such as shown above. Step 7 = repeat the process for all DUIDs that were operational across 2016 to 2018. Step 8 = plot these curves for all DUIDs in a given fuel type, and include under the relevant Fuel Type heading in Part 4 of the Generator Report Card. Those familiar with NEM analysis will understand that this exercise has identified a number of supplementary questions that could be the topic of follow-on analysis. Such questions have been posed in the Report Card. (B) Why is analysis like this important? We really should not need to be stated – however the fact that it does need to be clarified is just one more example of the mess we’ve been making of this energy transition , to date: B1) We need much clearer, and broader, visibility In the Generator Report Card, we discuss how the NEM is becoming increasingly dependent on the weather ( Theme 6 in Part 2 ) and how, partly as a result of this, the level of risk in the NEM is escalating ( Theme 2 in Part 2 ). It should be clear, therefore, that the energy industry needs much clearer and broader visibility of how the weather (and particularly the extremes in weather) can impact on all technology types in the generation sector – and an early warning system if such patterns were to materially change over time. (a) This is true not just inside the core industry bodies (COAG Energy Council, ESB, AEMC, AEMO, AER, Government Departments, etc…) which, at their core, need a solid understanding of technical fundamentals that support the grid. Most of these organisations are now poring through the details within the Report Card ( download your copy here ), so that’s a great start. (b) In the increasingly vocal space that is the broader group of energy sector stakeholders , we also need a deeper level of understanding – for in the absence of this we’ll continue advocating for “solutions” that won’t actually meet our needs moving forwards. B2) … but have been poorly served, to date Unfortunately, it’s been the view of the authors that the broader energy sector has been poorly served to date with analysis such as this – or such as the broader Generator Report Card in more general terms. (a) As discussed in the Generator Report Card ( Theme 14 in Part 2 ) the transitional challenges require greatly enhanced analytical capability . (b) The little analysis that’s we’ve seen in this area, to date, has been fairly shallow in nature – and (in our view) a little too ideologically focused to have a real sustained benefit. (C) If you thought coal (or thermal), you guessed wrong Let’s get the main point out of the way, for a start – it was not a coal unit (or, indeed, any thermal plant) that was profiled as the “mystery DUID” as having such a marked limitation in output at high temperatures. Impatient readers can skip to (E) below to learn which it was. Those with their own copy of the Generator Report Card ( under each Fuel Type in Part 4 ) can see that each type of technology has its own specific profile of output limitations – which are more a function of the technology itself than the particular fuel that they use (though obviously there is some link). (D) What were the guesses we saw? Given the above as the starting point, we were not really too surprised to see a number of the guesses rolling in very wide of the mark . Again, just another demonstration that there’s quite a poor level of understanding of critical limitations (such as the above) across a broader group of energy sector stakeholders, including amongst prolific commentators who (we would hope) should know better. At the time of writing this post, there were 14 comments at the bottom of the original article . Further afield, we also saw comments roll in over various platforms (including LinkedIn here , Twitter here (and elsewhere), and further afield on social media and in one-on-one contact). D1) Those skewed towards thermal plant There were a significant number of people whose guesses were skewed towards thermal plant – and particularly coal plant . The following are some of those guesses I was able to record, though note that the number was considerably larger – and that these ones are only included as examples to help readers here understand the “starting point” we’re facing in terms of helping people understand what’s actually happening: Our suspicion has been that many (though not all) of people who are guessing coal and/or gas units might have been erroneously influenced by a very vocal #coalfail campaign that seems to have confused many people about what are the true limitations of coal plant. D2) The Analysts However there were a (albeit smaller) group of people who did contact me in various ways to submit their guesses that were actually based on real personal experience – and also (in even rarer occasions) had gone to the extent of performing some of their own analysis* to try to replicate what we’d done, and so were able to get much closer to the mark. * If only there were more people in the NEM who’d actually do that, and not just blindly accept whatever is the most vocal group out there! A copy of the Generator Report Card would be a close second best option. A special mention goes to Mike Hudson with this string of comments on the prior article on WattClarity : (E) Which was the offending unit? The “mystery DUID” was the Ararat Wind Farm – as this very astute contributor noted on Twitter: Thanks Geoff! E1) Some reasons why Wind Farms might be so significantly affected by high temperatures As discussed in the Generator Report Card, there are a number of possible reasons that a wind farm might face such severe limitations in output at high temperatures (noting that these may, or may not , affect Ararat WF in particular): Consideration #1) Remember that a number of wind farms are located in inland rural areas, which are more affected by extremes in temperatures than those located within the catchment area of coastal sea breezes. Consideration #2) A number of turbine suppliers are European, and are known to have European-style “high temperature” protection systems that start affecting output at relatively low temperatures (by Australian standards). It might have been the case during construction that supplementary cooling systems were not added to gearboxes and so on… Consideration #3) It is fairly well understood that the weather patterns in some parts of inland Australia that low wind speeds are tightly correlated with high temperatures . Hence wind farms located in these places would have energy resource limitations that deliver low output. Consideration #4) It is also noted that transmission constraint s might have bound consistently at high temperatures, hence limiting output at higher temperatures. At the end of the day, from a system security point of view, it’s a secondary consideration which are the contributing factors in each case – the broader take-away is that Ararat Wind Farm: (a) never saw output rise above 85% capacity factor when local temperatures were above 35 degrees, and (b) saw output potential drop precipitously for each degree of temperature rise above that level. E2) What’s the broader concern We found other wind farms displaying similar characteristics (Mike Hudson hints at some above – see Part 4 of the Generator Report Card for some details) this should be a matter of serious further investigation , to ensure that we can take these limitations into account in the design of the system. Given the number of DUIDs across the NEM (remembering that we performed this analysis across all DUIDs) we did not have time to drill into further details for specific DUIDs – though this surely should be something that the industry would have a crucial interest in, given that the NEM is likely to experience more extremes in temperatures moving forwards ( Theme 2 in Part 2 ). (F) Want to understand more about the Generator Report Card?

    "title": "Some very preliminary details of the possible causes of the Argentinian Blackout",
    "date": "18-06-2019 02:08:00 PM",
    "content": "The limited public information on the cause of the Argentinian Blackout on Sunday, indicates that their 500kV grid may have been operating insecure due to a long term outage of one 500kV line when the unexpected outage of another 500kV line led to a cascading event resulting in the collapse and shutdown of the entire Argentinian and Paraguay power systems, blacking up to 50 million people for up to 14 hours. Following is some information found on the internet that may explain what happened, noting that a detailed investigation is underway into the event by the Argentinian authorities that will identify the root causes. Attached is a map of the Argentinian grid, dated 2004, indicating that new 500kv transmission lines were planned at that time, however it is understood that these grid augmentations were delayed due to a freeze on electricity prices, resulting in a shortage of funds needed for the upgrades. Argentina’s economy is in a state of crisis. Gerardo Rabinovich, an energy consultant who is vice president of the Argentine Energy Institute says that “Although it is true that Argentina has solid generation and distribution capacity, transportation clearly needs an upgrade because there are lots of parts of the system that are saturated,” As illustrated on the map, one 500kv line was already out of service since April. This appears to be a critical line connecting the northern region (which has large hydro-electric power stations), to the main load centre at Buenos Aires At 7am on Sunday, a 500kv transmission fault appears to have taken out another 500kV line further north – which may have left only a single 500kv line connecting a region with high generation to the rest of the Argentinian 500kV grid. It appears that a cascading situation or grid instability, appears to have occurred that separated major hydro stations from the power system. There is some mention of over-supply causing generators to trip which could be referring to the complete islanding of a region with lots of generation. Whilst there is no information on how the incident spread further, the result was the blackout of the entire Argentinian and Paraguay power systems. Interestingly Argentina is the only other country, besides the Australian NEM, that relies of a market for frequency regulation and allows generators to not participate in the restoration of large frequency deviations. It remains to be seen whether poor frequency regulation contributed to the ultimate collapse of the entire Argentinian power system in the latter stages of this event.. Please note that the above is based on very limited information or knowledge of the Argentinian power system ——————————————- Some Information reported on the internet on the event: Since April, an electricity transmission connection between two power plants in Colonia Elia and Nueva Campana has been out of service. Even with that connection not operating, Argentina’s electrical grid was prepared to withstand another connection being severed from the grid. However, it wasn’t able to. A second connection went offline on Sunday, effectively destabilizing two power stations and triggering safeguard mechanisms that put them out of action. That sent the whole grid offline and created the blackout. Authorities are investigating how the latter connection was disrupted, with energy officials saying it could take up to 15 days to determine the cause. Although officials said every possible cause would be considered, “we do not believe that a cyberattack is within the possibilities,” said Mr. Lopetegui, the energy secretary. “This was an extraordinary event that should not have occurred,” he said, calling Argentina’s electrical grid “robust with excess capacity in both generation and transportation.” Although it is true that Argentina has solid generation and distribution capacity, “transportation clearly needs an upgrade because there are lots of parts of the system that are saturated,” said Gerardo Rabinovich, an energy consultant who is vice president of the Argentine Energy Institute. “Generally, though, these things happen not because of a lack of robustness in the system but rather a lack of coordination,” Mr. Rabinovich said. “Failures in lines can happen, but what cannot happen is for this failure to then propagate to the whole system.” While big questions remain over what caused the blackout, Edesur said a “collapse” in Argentina’s government-operated interconnection system occurred around 7 a.m. local time on Sunday (6 a.m. ET). Utility distributor Edenor, which controls 20% of the Argentine market, about 3 million customers, said a transmission system at Yacyretá Dam — on the Paraná River near Ayolas, Paraguay — failed “without human intervention,” forcing an automatic shutdown. Edesur added that the failure began in a transport connection between the dam and the Salto Grande power stations on Argentina’s coast. The shutdown was a protective measure, it said. ——————————————- About our Guest Author Simon Bartlett is an experienced electrical engineer who has six years experience as a professor and forty years’ experience in the power industry in electricity transmission, power systems and generation in Australia, Europe and Canada (including as Chief Operating Officer at Powerlink Queensland).

    "title": "Extended outage of Loy Yang A unit 2 – reliability and forward price impacts",
    "date": "14-06-2019 04:27:00 PM",
    "content": "As highlighted in Paul McArdle’s initial post on this topic this week, an extended outage of unit 2 at AGL’s Loy Yang A power station has generated considerable interest in the media (conventional and social) and speculation about price and reliability implications for Victoria, extending into the early summer period. This brief post examines what we can see in data published this week in AEMO’s medium term reliability outlook (“MTPASA”), and any impacts that knowledge of the outage has had on forward electricity prices for the second half of this year. A little bit of history Just before that, some might be wondering why such a long outage period is required to repair the electrical damage sustained by LYA unit 2’s generator . The complete answer to that question requires going back to the 1970’s and the history of the Newport (yes Newport) gas-fired power station, which was originally designed as a 1,000 MW station comprising two 500 MW units. The then State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) had proceeded as far as ordering two turbine-generator units for Newport from their chosen suppliers (Alstom/Brown-Boveri) before their plans were derailed by concerns over metropolitan air quality impacts and an ultimate decision to downsize Newport to a single 500 MW station. This left the SECV with the problem of what to do with an extra 500 MW turbo-generator package for which the order could not be cancelled. Someone in the SECV had the bright idea of installing Newport’s unwanted sibling generator at Loy Yang A power station which was then less advanced in design and construction, and reducing the planned order for that station of four 500 MW turbo-generators from proposed suppliers Siemens/Kraftwerk Union, to three. While this solved the SECV’s immediate problem of where to store an otherwise surplus-to-requirements multi-million dollar piece of equipment the size (and many times the mass) of a large bus, it bequeathed a number of headaches to the designers, operators and later owners of Loy Yang A, in running and maintaining two different types of turbo-generator unit in the one station. This is particularly relevant when it comes to managing spare parts for very large and expensive pieces of kit like generators. These essentially comprise two very massive parts known as a stator (what you can see on the outside) and a rotor, the rotating part inside the generator, spun in the stator’s magnetic field by the power of the steam turbine to create electrical power. In a multiple unit station, or group of stations, all using the same brand of generator, it is reasonable to carry a spare rotor and stator which can be used to replace a damaged component on any of the operating generators in the station or fleet. AGL does carry such spares for the generators in use on Loy Yang A units 1, 3 and 4. But doing this for a single generator of a different type – the situation for Loy Yang A2 – is much harder to justify and it appears AGL do not carry such spares for this unit. As a result, the damaged stator and rotor at LYA2 can’t be “swapped out” for replacement with spares on hand (a big job anyway), but will have to be fully repaired before the unit can come back to service, potentially in early December. Reliability Outlook Back from the history lesson, what are AEMO and the forward market telling us about the impacts of the outage? First, here’s an ez2view trend chart showing data from AEMO’s weekly MTPASA reliability run for Victoria, published later than usual this week to factor in the potential length of the LYA outage: Purple lines on this chart show potential maximum daily demands (on 1-in-2 and 1-in-10 year bases) across the balance of this year, while the dark line is available dispatchable (scheduled) generation capacity – clearly obvious and highlighted are two periods in September- early October and November-early December where significant groups of outages are currently planned at other Victorian generators. The orange bars show AEMO’s assessed “Loss of Load Probability” metric under the assumption of maximum demand actually occurring at the relevant times , with this rising to high levels (up to 100%) during the November – early December period. This is driven by the higher potential demands as we move into summer, together with the previously discussed outages. I’ve previously discussed the basis for and interpretation of these reliability assessments in this earlier WattClarity article . What’s not explicit on this chart is how much lower the risk of load shedding would be without the extended LYA2 outage. A hint of this can be gained from the change in LoLP values after the nadir in available capacity seen in mid-November. The capacity line steps up by about 500 MW (LYA2’s capacity), and despite higher potential demands as we move towards summer, LoLP values fall significantly in late November, before virtually disappearing the back half of December, at which time LYA2 is presumably assumed back in service in this analysis. So we can probably broadly conclude that without the LYA2 outage, this assessment would be showing some LoLP in the depth of the November outage period, and little or none outside that window. It’s also worth emphasising that there are lots of moving parts and assumptions built into these assessments, such as the timing of other generator outages which might well change as participants assess the impact of the LYA2 outage, and that any actions that AEMO might take on the RERT front to bolster physical supply reliability are not taken into account. Market Price Outlook This second ez2view trend chart shows the market price impacts – if any – of the outage, on both spot prices in Victoria and forward contracts for quarters three and four of 2019: The stepped green line shows that Victorian spot prices, expressed as weekly averages, have not changed markedly since the outage commenced on May 18th. The blue and red lines show traded forward prices for Victorian Q3 and Q4 baseload futures contracts respectively. These do show a reaction, having risen about $5-10/MWh and with more evident volatility since the outage commenced. Cap prices (the lower orange and green lines) have shown considerably less reaction, indicating that market sentiment sees less risk of outright volatility (“spikeiness”) in spot prices than of a general upward drift with the absence of lower-cost supply from LYA2. A final observation on this chart is the very large volume of baseload contracts (the chart columns) apparently traded just after the outage – over 1,000 MW of each. This is probably not new contracting activity but more likely an artefact of futures contracts being “exchanged for physical” – however the timing is very coincidental and reasons for it not at all clear. Impact on AGL Financials What if anything can be deduced from AGL’s announced FY2019-20 financial impacts from the outage (in the range of $60-$100M after tax)? A very simple computation of energy not generated as a result of the outage (around 1,500 GWh over July-November) implies a net before-tax cost to AGL of $60-$100/MWh. This is broadly in line with the gross cost of buying energy from significantly higher cost sources such as gas-fired plant or even directly from the spot market, and while AGL’s figure may include some element of repair costs on the damaged generator, it highlights the financial impact of losing access to a low variable cost source of energy in brown coal generation. ——————————————- About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

    "title": "17-year trend of aggregated coal unit unavailability as from the Generator Report Card",
    "date": "14-06-2019 09:11:00 AM",
    "content": "Firstly, my apologies for those who tried to wade through my imprecise verbal explanation (in Thursday’s RenewEconomy podcast ) of the analysis we’d done of generator ‘dependability’ as one part within the mammoth Generator Report Card – I note that Giles called it a “compendium” and David called it a “weighty tome”. Add that to the list of adjectives , but the best feedback for me is that those who have bought and read a copy have been very positive about the effort. Makes the 1,000s of hours invested worthwhile. However, back to the podcast – where it seems that I have a ‘voice for mime’, along with a ‘head for radio’. Perhaps I just stick to the written word on WattClarity for now! Because I was not as clear as I would have liked to have been, I thought I owed it to those listeners who took the time to listen to explain (in clearer written English) what we’d done – particularly with respect to the availability of coal units. ———————– Amongst the 530 pages that the Generator Report Card encompasses, we included: (1) 6 pages under Theme 8 in Part 2 where we discuss some aspects of how “Thermal plant is ageing, and this brings concerns”; along with (2) Another 38 pages in Part 4 about a range of different data on coal-fired power that now operates across 3 regions of the NEM (down from 4 with the closure of Northern in South Australia in 2016). That’s a few pages (not counting the individual pages for every DUID – i.e. fancy AEMO term for dispatchable unit, for those who asked before – in Part 3 ), but the reason why such a focus is given is that ( as ABC journalist Stephen Letts quotes here ) 75% of the “grid energy” supplied by the NEM is still supplied by coal-fired power stations, of which there are 48 units still operational (10 brown coal in Victoria, and the rest black coal in NSW and QLD). Hence they are critical to supplies – and effecting an energy transition that works must incorporate proper, rational (and not so emotive) consideration of what’s actually happening with these coal power stations. (A) Assessing different facets of ‘dependability’ Hence we took at detailed look, which I tried (unsuccessfully?) to explain in the podcast. Key to this was a consideration of these different aspects of the ‘dependability’ of coal-fired power : 1) In the podcast, I just tried to explain what we’d done with Availability – 2) Whilst David also mentioned one of the three different methods we used to look at “Sudden Failure” ( chart already included in this post ). … it’s important for readers to understand that these two measures are somewhat related, but also separate as well, and that all 5 have their own value in the understanding of broader ‘dependability’ (and, as we note in the report, these 5 are not the only ones that are important). (B) One facet is Availability In the podcast, I tried (unsuccessfully?) to explain what we had done in analysing the level of availability (or, more specifically, the un availability as a monthly volumetric measure ) of the 48 x operational coal-fired plant across 20 years of history, noting that 6 of the units in QLD (super-critical units – with HELE seeming to be the latest buzzword descriptor, and a very vague one at that) were only fully commissioned at the end of 2007. I spoke about 3 charts we produced, so I thought it would be clearest if I included them here, along with the relevant accompanying text from within Part 2 and Part 4 of the Report Card. This excerpt came from the summary in Part 2, showing unavailability as a volumetric measure: We then broke this down into two broad categories “fully unavailable” (i.e. unit offline) and “partially unavailable” (i.e. unit availability lower than registered capacity), as follows – and then further sub-categories (not shown here): We then looked first at full unavailability, and noted that the 17-year trailing annual aggregate trend (because availability was not published by the AEMO in the first couple years) was quite flat , allowing for variation in the timing of major outages for these units and periods of over supply and under supply. However taking a look at partial unavailability, we saw a fairly consistent trend of increase : As noted, this is worth further investigation – however we do not know of any other analysis (at least in the public domain) that has been completed to this level of detail, or which has taken it further. If readers do know, we would be grateful if you could note this below? ——————————– Don’t forget that you can order your copy here today (to receive your own hard-copy, and an electronic PDF for your organisation’s internal use).",

    "title": "Brief comment on the extended outage at Loy Yang A unit 2",
    "date": "10-06-2019 08:37:00 AM",
    "content": "In the early hours of Saturday 18th May 2019, Loy Yang A unit 2 tripped and came offline, as shown in this snapshot from ez2view Time-Travelled back to just after that time: Almost 3 weeks later, on Friday 7th June AGL published this ASX notice of “FY20 impact of extended unit outage at Loy Yang” . It seems that the use of the “extended” word sparked some more widespread concerns: 1) particularly given that the Victorian region was with South Australia in suffering through 24th and 25th January , now only 5 months ago; and 2) with the AGL notice stating that the outage “may extend seven months” , which would bring it into summer 2019-20 . It is entirely understandable that there is concern – which is something we might look at further later in the week on WattClarity, time permitting. (A) Coverage in the media, and on social media Following from the AGL notice, I saw some coverage on Friday which both seem to use a Reuters feed in both: the Age by Michael Fowler and others with “AGL Energy flags seven month outage at Victoria’s Loy Yang power plant” and also in the AFR under “AGL Energy flags seven month outage at Victoria’s Loy Yang power plant” Over the weekend it was predictable that there were a number of notes that hit social media about the outage, including these ones (images linked to the discussions that followed): The flurry on social media (beyond just the above) was followed on Monday morning with an article in the Australian by Perry Williams “States facing summer of blackouts as coal generator goes offline” . Perry asked me a few questions whilst writing his article, so I suggested he read some of what we’d put together in the Generator Report Card as it would help to provide some context about coal unit “dependability”. I expect that social media will continue doing what it does this week, particularly with Energy Week conference on in Melbourne, along with this energy storage conference in Sydney. Hence I thought it might be useful to provide more context… (B) Some initial comments from us, in the light of the Generator Report Card The extended outage of Loy Yang A2 unit is a significant concern – particularly if that outage were to extend into summer 2019-20, which seems possible. On January 24th and 25th we saw what can happen in an electricity grid that experiences extreme temperatures simultaneous with outages of a few key dispatchable plant and relatively low yield from intermittent resources. Perhaps later this week, we will have time to post on WattClarity some deeper analysis of possible implications if the outage extends into summer . Management of an electricity grid (and hence market) has always involved elements of risk , and management of that risk. As we have explained through the Generator Report Card , that overall level of risk has been escalating in recent years (for a number of reasons). It’s like we’ve been playing Russian Roulette with the grid/market, but with more loaded chambers than there used to be. Unfortunately, mistaken comments amongst the broader energy commentariat are actually contributing to this higher risk environment (it’s part of what we discuss in Theme 14 within Part 2 ). This is why we invested so much time in the production of a Generator Report Card, in order to show how things actually are. Concerns about ageing assets , and a possible decline in dependability with them, are not new – I wrote about “doomsday predictions” back in September 2014 , for instance. In more recent times a more concerted campaign has started to attribute every instance where a thermal unit comes offline to the ageing of the asset. However that’s not the case – and indeed such a simplistic generalisation is one example of a deficit in energy literacy that’s contributing to the escalation of risk. For instance, our deep analysis in the Generator Report Card does not show a clear systemic trend across the 48 operational coal units for them becoming less reliable as a fleet (though readers might like to reference these notes specific AGL units ). Here’s that chart from the Report Card again that looks at one measure of “Sudden Failure” in this broader framework of “dependability” : Readers will also note that the highest bars in most years tend not to be during the hottest months of the year , which is also interesting in the context of claims that “coal units break down more in the heat”. What do seem to be the case are two things: 1) Firstly (because there are fewer units, and because demand is increasingly peaky) a small number of outages during times of high demand places much more stress on the grid than used to be the case; and 2) Because there are an increasing number of NEM observers equipped with the latest tools (some of them ours), and because we all know that summer is the critical time, we notice outages a lot more when they happen during summer. These things do happen from time-to-time. Loy Yang A4 unit was offline from December 2001 to May 2002 as a result of major failure of its generator that warranted a replacement being shipped in from Siemens in Germany: having Siemens supply a replacement in that way ensured a significantly shorter outage than would otherwise have been the case under a “repair” scenario – a replacement might also be an option on this occasion as well (from its own OEM in that case). that was 17 years ago, when the station was obviously much younger than it is today. Age is not the only factor we should be looking at. This recent outage (and, importantly, the early reactions to it) is just one more reminder of the “world class mess” we’ve all been making of this energy transition. That’s something we’ve been very conscious of in the 7 months of development of the Generator Report Card . We’ve done our job, in putting the Report Card together – now it’s over to the broader audience, to use it to help drive positive change and avoid what’s hurtling down the track towards us . This week’s Q&A Event in Melbourne is sold out, but there’s still a few spots at the upcoming sessions in Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney for those who would like to learn more about the Report card. ————— The order form for the Generator Report Card is here.",

It shows a figure we drew to explain some of the different ways in which we assessed the degree of “dependability” of coal-fired power in the NEM , and the extent to which that’s been changing over time – using 20 years of historical performance data as a base. As noted in the footnote on the page, the authors deliberately chose to use the word “dependability” precisely as an attempt to help the reader focus on the intent behind the word, rather than have some readers get stuck in discussions about established industry definitions.",

    "title": "Some early comments made about the Generator Report Card",
    "date": "03-06-2019 08:51:00 AM",
    "content": "Last Friday 31st May (3 days ago) our Generator Report Card was released – with: electronic access established to those clients who had previously pre-ordered their copies (and also those who purchased on the day of release). a bonus hard copy was also provided to each client (this was something we’d not initially promised to do, though it became apparent over the 6 months of development, as the report grew to be a 530-page monster, that the hard-copy would be a very useful ready-reference point in the weeks and months into the future (especially the 328 page 10-year statistical digest provided in part 3 )). One of the challenges we’ve been grappling with has been how to convey the breadth , and the depth , of what we’ve done. As the Report Card came together, we increasingly came to the perspective that it was quite different from anything that had been done beforehand in the NEM – at least to our knowledge. Hence we thought we’d share some of the comments we’ve received that (we think) help to sum up the scale of what’s available to you in this report (and we’re also arranging for informal Q&A sessions in various locations through June and July where you’d be welcome to come in and flip through a copy to see for yourself – more on that at WattClarity shortly). Whilst what we reference below are other people’s words, so may not be 100% reflective of what we’re actually saying in the Report Card (you’ll need to read the Report Card yourself to understand the points of difference), I’ve flagged a few particular points that do help to convey breadth and depth…. (A) Comments in the general media On Friday morning, ABC journalist Stephen Letts published an article “National Electricity Market lacks holistic thinking and risks failing to keep the lights on” . Within this article, what particularly resonated was that: 1a) Stephen stated it was a 600-page report. This is entirely understandable, given he was flipping through a bound hard-copy (and with 5 separate parts), it’s not possible to quickly see how many pages are therein. However given we’d invested thousands of hours and agonised on trying to ensure that the data we were using was correct, and that we were correctly interpreting it as much as possible, I’ve felt it necessary to clarify that it’s “only” 530 pages all-up. 1b) In discussion that’s followed subsequently on social media (personally I only use LinkedIn and Twitter , so have not checked elsewhere) there’s been some inferring that the report is focused on government policy, market structure and regulation – and, whilst there is discussion there, we’ve consciously tried to write from the perspective of helping individual organisations (participants in the wholesale market – particularly new entrants, and also organisations on the outside providing services to these wholesale participants) identify opportunities and risks for their businesses. 1c) Thanks also to Stephen for the comment here on Twitter “ impressive & important work on the NEM … get a copy if you’re an energy policy wonk” – though I’d add that I hope it’s particularly useful to those who don’t have their “wonk-o-meters” dialled all the way up to 11. By Friday afternoon, Giles Parkinson over at RenewEconomy had published his own synopsis of some of what jumped out to him for his readers in “Energy transition has only just begun, but solar has already changed the game” . In this case, what particularly jumped out to us was: 2a) First and foremost what jumped out was Giles noting that what we have delivered was “unique” (which, it seems to us, it is) and that “It is, literally, a mine of information ” (which was our intention when we started the process around October 2018. Giles notes “More stories will inevitably emerge over time as we digest the data-rich pages ”, so we will watch with interest to see what else resonates. 2b) Given that new entrants, which RenewEconomy speaks directly to, was one of the audiences we envisaged would gain value from the Report Card, it was particularly of interest to us to see what was selected in this first article: (i) First was a comment about rooftop PV and declining demand – clearly one factor that’s growing in reduction of “grid supply”. Given that I’d already posted this back in 2011, would be useful to link in this longer list of factors that have contributed to the change in consumption patterns – but also caution, as we do in the Report Card, not to assume that this “grid supply” is continuing to decline. (ii) Second was the note Giles made that “The number of coal trips in the NEM – a source of consternation for the market operator and analysts alike – are actually significantly lower than the were a decade ago. In fact, over the last five years, they have been reasonably consistently inconsistent at around 200 trips a year (down from a peak near 300 in 2004, and between 2007 and 2009).” . This was made with respect to this image from the report: Note that Part 4 of the report contains a detailed (38 page) discussion about coal, given it’s still such a large share of the energy mix – and includes consideration of different aspects of what we term different aspects of what we call “the dependability” of coal ( using this framework ). Give the detail of the coverage in the Report Card, it’s not possible to comment more here in relation to other aspects of how coal unit performance is a little different than what some might have believed beforehand based (some results surprised us). (iii) Giles also included a comment about how we’ve taken a deeper look at the degree of anti- correlation apparent in the data across the NEM for three scenarios: Group 1 = all operational wind and solar plant (operational data 24×7) Group 2 = operational solar plant (operational data, just daylight hours); and Group 3 = wind patterns by Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) over 11 years of history. … in order to see how much anti-correlation we could see (we describe in the Report Card under a Part 2 Theme called “when ‘the sun does not shine and wind does not blow’’” why this is the ultimate objective we’d be striving for to reduce the cost of the transition). Giles included this figure of a sample week in the NSW region which did show a degree of anti-correlation between wind and solar – one waxing whilst the other waning: On Monday morning, we noted that Peter Hannam in the Sydney Morning Herald had written about “National electricity market becoming riskier as stresses mount: report” , and highlighted what we’d noted in the Generator Report Card about several things: 3a) The NEM becoming a higher risk environment, not the least of which because of increased dependence on the weather, in a number of different ways; and 3b) How we’ve included some consideration of several factors about the exit of thermal plant (which we’ve noted is something that’s not really been given the considered attention it deserves – and we’re not just meaning here in general planning documents, but also from a new entry business development perspective). (B) Comments on social media As we all know, social media is a bit of a minefield, with a diverse range of views expressed there (with respect to the energy transition ) coming from people at all points of the Emotion-o-meter . Given the profile of the Report Card, it was expected that there’s be a bit of commentary about it in different quarters – what follows is a very brief not about some particular comments we noted: 1) I noted somewhere (can’t remember where) that it was mistakenly claimed that the report was commissioned by the AEMO and/or some government – it wasn’t clear in my reading which organisation was supposed to have commissioned it. Let me be clear that the Generator Report Card was certainly NOT the case that the AEMO, or any Government, or anyone else, commissioned the report . (a) Indeed Stephen Letts here was very clear in faithfully nothing that “The report was not sponsored by an organisation or interest group, nor does it take sides on fuel type or technology, but was prepared for commercial energy users and industry analysts.” so I am not really sure where that author mistakenly inferred that idea from? (b) The Report Card is deliberately, and definitely, independent of any of the combined clients across the two collaborating organisations (Global-Roam and Greenview Strategic Consulting ). 2) The above just seemed to typify the general problem with social media, in that many people seemed to be commenting on the Report Card itself without having read it , and merely just reading through the articles on ABC or RenewEconomy or SMH above (each of which do contain some of the general ideas in the Report Card itself – though there are some findings lost in translation): (a) One of the underlying failings that we’ve tried to emphasize in the Report Card is that the shallowness of the level of thinking surrounding this energy transition (particularly at both extremes of the Emotion-o-meter ) is one of the main reasons why we spoke about train-wreck coming down the line at us. (b) Somehow misconstruing (or perhaps just misrepresenting, for unknown purpose) that the report was commissioned by particular parties just typifies that… 3) For those of you who follow “energy Twitter ”, we’ve tried to tag comments that have come in with #GeneratorReportCard2018 so as to make them accessible later . These might be useful to our readers. 4) Over on LinkedIn , we’ve used the same #GeneratorReportCard2018 tag and expect that the references will build up more slowly over time there. 5) We don’t particularly follow, or use, any other platform – hence can’t help with any of the others… (C) Comments direct from clients In the 7-month gestation period that occurred for the Generator Report Card , we appreciated the opportunity offer those who showed keen interest in the product (even from late 2018 when it had only started coming together) the chance to get their pre-orders in early at “early bird” pricing. These clients received access to the Generator Report Card on Friday, with most also receiving their hard copies on that day as well. Those who ordered on the day itself received electronic access, and should receive their hard copies this week. A number of points of feedback were submitted, with some particularly resonating in terms of the the breadth , and the depth , so we thought we’d share some briefly here … with details client details anonymised: 1) One client (a newish entrant generator) made the comment that “Thank you, this is amazing ! You have dramatically reduced productivity in the office with everyone trawling through it ” , which did give both Jonathon Dyson and myself a chuckle, and also noted that “the hard copy did turn up – and is now on the table in our lunch room”, which does seem a logical place for the hard copy (especially if you understand how the office functions), as we see numerous people flipping through the document, particularly the statistical digest in Part 3 , whilst waiting for their coffee in the weeks and months ahead. 2) Another client (another generator) noted “Hard copy has arrived. It’s so good to actually hold it in my hands to feel how much work has gone into this. A pdf does not convey the immensity of the work you have done.” . It’s nice to hear that, as we certainly came to the view that a hard-copy would be more useful long-term in terms of quick access to certain parts of the Report Card (we’re already finding that in our conversations). 3) A third client noted “What a rich resource ! I look forward to exploring it over coming weeks.” For us, it’s nice to get to this end of our process, as there was certainly a share of blood, sweat and tears in putting it together in recent months – and we would particularly like to thank our pre-existing clients for being so patient with us whilst we were (in some senses) distracted with the Report Card. 4) Given that they’re a client who received their copy on Friday, this public tweet by Flow Power “ Great read …” is worth referencing as a general point of feedback on the Report Card. 5) Also able to flag the “great report, very useful” comment from Samantha Christie inside the NSW Department Planning and Environment. 6) After first glancing through the copy that was delivered to another of our clients they noted “At first glance it looks like you guys have done a fantastic job! ” . They have promised more feedback after digesting, and we look forward to that. 7) Another comment “Will need to make the time to read it / do it justice ” reflects, to us, the size and scope of what we have delivered. 8) Another client noted “We received a hard copy in the post today, so fantastic service ! ” – which seems to be essentially a comment about the addition of the hard-copy report, despite the fact that it was not originally promised to those who ordered early (but is now, for those who order now ). 9) One academic who received his copy noted “very much look forward to working through what looks like an incredibly detailed and valuable set of reports and tools” . 10) A client in another government department noted “It looks great, a terrific layout , and I have shared it with colleagues” . We’ll look forward to more feedback from them. … and we could go on, but the above should provide some indication of initial response from those who ordered in advance and so received their copies on Friday last week. Many of the comments could be summed up as “Wow!”. —————– Don’t forget that you can order your copy here today .",

    "content": "This morning (Friday 31st May 2019) our Generator Report Card was finally released! This was a collaborative effort between the team here at Global-Roam Pty Ltd and the team at Greenview Strategic Consulting . The exercise certainly challenged both organisations (and we thank our broader client base for being so patient with us during the 7 months we devoted to the exercise). We’re very pleased to reach the finish line – and, in particular, with the breadth and depth of what we’ve been able to deliver. (A) Accessing your copy of the Generator Report Card Which category do you fit in: Which group are you in? This is how you access your copy Your organisation has already purchased access to the Report Card? Clients who pre-ordered their copy in advance for your organisation’s internal purposes (between 29th October 2018, when we commenced the process , and yesterday) should now have their access to the electronic copy Generator Report Card here: if you have a licence… Download the Generator Report Card PDF If you have not already done so, you’ll need to set up your own unique log-in, using your organisational email address in order to access: if your organisation already has a licence you’ll then download the electronic copy – it’s a 76Mb PDF so keep this in mind if on a low-speed link this process works in Chrome, Edge and Safari (but not currently in Internet Explorer). One bound hard-copy is also being supplied to these clients as well. Given the report grew to be 530 pages long, we realised that a physical copy would also be very useful on occasions. Additional hard-copies could be supplied, for a small additional fee (basically cost recovery). Payments will be processed shortly and Tax Invoices provided. —- We’re very, very keen to hear your feedback about how the Generator Report Card helps you . You’ve not already organised your copy? Not to worry – it’s a simple matter of completing the Order Form and sending back to us: the Order Form for the Generator Report Card … and send back to us. We’d then: (1) Set you up with electronic access at the site above (hence be sure to specify your corporate email address); and (2) Deliver your bound-hard copy; and (3) Process your payment and provide a tax invoice. No matter which category describes you, we look forward to hearing back from you. (B) What’s in the Generator Report Card Back in October 2018 when we set out on this process , we undertook to take a deeper dive into a number of curly questions that we were seeing repeating themselves in discussions about different aspects of generator performance, particularly in relation to this energy transition . Over the months since commencement, as the we processed through the analytical process, it became clear that the report should be provided in 5 parts as follows: Obviously with something that’s 530 pages long, it’s difficult to sum it all up in a single graphic such as the above… (C) If I wanted more information about the Generator Report Card If you want more information about the Generator Report Card, the information provided on pages starting here could be of some value. Given broad interest in the Generator Report Card that we’ve already seen in the broad range of individuals and organisations who have pre-ordered their copies, we are organising informal Q&A sessions on the report card (at least in Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney – and possibly other locations) through June and July. When more details are known we will post another article on WattClarity here , so keep an eye out for it, if this is of interest. Of course, you could also either: 1) Give us a call on +61 7 3368 4064 ; or 2) Use this Feedback Form to let us know how we can help. —————————— PS – don’t forget that the Order Form for your copy of the Generator Report Card is here .",

There are still a few (too many!) gaps that need to be filled in commentary on the analysis we have been doing, but we’re starting to see the end in sight of what has turned out to be a very intriguing (though also sometimes grueling) 6 month process. We’ve learnt loads, and are looking forward to sharing more with our clients.

I trust that this will answer some of the questions – though note that Part 3 is only one part of 5 Parts comprising the Report Card… —————— Back to the completion task now (for another 2 weeks or so) before we call “stop” and bundle it up to deliver to those who have already pre-ordered their copies.

Here’s one sample from the analysis this week for a “mystery DUID”: This analysis is being included with all the other analysis performed in our Generator Report Card – which will be released shortly after the federal election (to be held on Sat 18th May). ——————— Happy if you want to leave your guesses in comments below as to which DUID the above chart refers to.

    "date": "01-04-2019 03:08:00 PM",
    "content": "As frequent WattClarity readers will know, we’ve been investing thousands of hours in an extensive review of 20 years of a wide variety of generation performance data in order to prepare our Generator Report Card (with data generally to 31st December 2018). Over the past couple weeks as part of a broader combined team, my role has been to delve into considerable detail with respect to what we can see evolving with respect to production from Large Solar plant across the NEM (whilst others are applying similar levels of analysis for the other fuel types*). * note that Fuel Types are just one of the dimensions we’re using to determine what can be seen in the data. Given the recent after-effects of Tropical Cyclone Trevor last week, I thought it might be useful sharing this particular (preliminary!) trend more generally with WattClarity readers here: You’ll note in this case we have extended data beyond 31st December 2018 because of the more recent growth in large solar and lack of insufficient history beforehand. For all generators across the NEM, we’re particularly interested in varying aspects of dependability (as we define it in the Report Card). We’ll explain all of this in more detail in the Report Card (and still have to correct some of the foibles in the data set) but am particularly interested to note that, despite the growth of large solar capacity (even after commissioning) we see some significant reductions in output NEM-wide over multiple consecutive days as a result of major weather events. A couple are flagged in the chart about, with brief discussion below: late March 2019 Last week we saw the lingering after-effects of Tropical Cyclone Trevor turn into a rain depression that (amongst other things) dropped aggregate solar output across the NEM by almost half at its peak. late Jan 2019 and early Feb 2019 On 4th February I had previously noted how the north Queensland deluge (leading into the Townsville flooding event) had slashed output from solar plant across a wide area in the north of the state. 27th June 2018 Whatever caused this event is still to be investigated. 8th and 9th June 2018 I note that these low days of solar output (back when it was concentrated more in NSW) was unfortunately coincident with this “shaky week for the supply-demand balance” in NSW. We will be drilling into these types of results in more detail in the Report Card. ———————– Given the current toxic political climate leading into the Federal Election, we’ve elected to delay the release of the Report Card until after the election has been completed so to reduce the risk that our Report Card ends up a political football, and increase the likelihood it might help to achieve something constructive in this challenging energy transition. I’ve already notified those clients who have already chosen to pre-order their copy (at early-bird rates), but thought it worth noting more broadly here.

    "title": "About claims that AGL was responsible for the uplift in prices after Hazelwood closed",
    "date": "27-03-2019 09:30:00 PM",
    "content": "Every good story seems to require a gripping villain – and in the “Evolution of the NEM” storybook it appears we have found our own Voldemort, which goes by the name of Hazelwood. Here we are, 2 years after its supposed death, and it’s still making headlines. I know I should be focused on the strategic analysis that is a core part of the work that’s still incomplete on our mammoth Generator Report Card (a 20-year review of the generation sector the National Electricity Market). However this week I’ve felt the pull of that black hole that’s opened up where Hazelwood used to be – hence today I thought I’d try to make it constructive by offering some thoughts here. ———– (A) Context Let’s start with some context, about 2 different things: (A1) Setting the scene in the who-dunnit with respect to prices post-Hazelwood Rather than dive straight into the detail, I thought it would be useful to sum up a potted history of the path to closure at Hazelwood, and its aftermath: DATE EVENT prior to Nov 2016 ( prior to closure announcement) In the months and weeks leading up to the closure announcement there had been increasing speculation that the owner of the station (Engie) was having a change of heart and mind with respect to the assets for a variety of reasons. For instance: 1) I found our WattClarity article from September 2016 discussing some aspects . 2) An astute reader has pointed out “Victoria can survive Hazelwood closure” by Ben Potter in AFR on 17th October 2016 , which is particularly relevant given statements about possible price impacts.Even prior to the decision, and subsequent announcement, there had been plenty of questions asked about what the price implications of closure would be – which was one of the prompts to talk about these three reasons why no-one could actually “know” in advance, how substantially prices would shift . (a) Perhaps a little prescient, given we’re now sitting here almost 2 years after the station has closed arguing about the extent to which different factors are to blame for how much prices have risen. (b) Even moreso, it should be a reminder for us to keep a lid on any ideas we might have to “know” what the price impacts might be with the closure date of Liddell fast approaching as well, as the next domino to fall in this multi-faceted energy transition. November 2016 to March 2017 ( between closure announcement and closure) On 3rd November 2016, we noted how the closure announcement for the Hazelwood station was quickly reflected in the drop in available capacity in MT PASA . This is as would have been expected, and should be non-controversial. What’s proving more open to subjective judgement, it seems, is understanding the flurry of activity that the closure announcement prompted – both in the physical market and in the financial/hedging market. With the closure of Hazelwood looming, we noted on 14th March how hedge prices had started to climb , for instance. end March 2017 (closure) By the end of March 2017, Hazelwood had closed . March 2017 to March 2019 (two years after closure) In the two years after closure, it seems that Hazelwood is still having an impact on the NEM – even though it’s no longer around. Around August 2017 there were some claims made in analysis by Schneider EMS (I can’t find record of it online, but if someone points me to it I will link it in here) that, by my recollection, were implying generators were using market power to raise prices higher than they should be following the closure of Hazelwood. The claims by Schneider were echoed in various places, including “AGL, Origin bidding up power spot price, says Schneider” by Matt Chambers in the Australian on 30th August 2017 . Following from these claims, on 3rd November 2016 the AER was asked to investigate, as a result of which they published “AER electricity wholesale performance monitoring: Hazelwood advice” in March 2018 , after a 17-month investigation ( PDF report is here ). In parallel with this specific AER review (and not specifically related to Hazelwood but certainly with that as one factor), the ACCC had been directed (on 27th March 2017) to hold an inquiry into the supply of retail electricity and the competitiveness of retail electricity prices. (a) A preliminary report was published on 16th October 2017 ; and (b) The final report was published on 11th July 2018 . —– The volume of chatter about Hazelwood seemed to wane somewhat since that time, until the publication of “The exercise of market power in Australia’s National Electricity Market following the closure of the Hazelwood Power Station “ by the Victorian Energy Policy Centre this week on Monday 25th March, as a result of which the dial’s gone up to 11 again. Amongst other coverage, there was this coverage on the 7:30 Report on Monday night . We noted “Coal constraints in NSW and energy prices following the sudden closure of Hazelwood” in response from AGL Energy on Tuesday 26th March. Finally, also yesterday I received a call from Cole Latimer at SMH asking questions about the report. Given our focus has been on the longer-term context of our 20-year review of the generation sector NEM-wide (i.e. our Generator Report Card ) I spoke with this broader perspective in mind. However in the article “’10 years late’: Calls mount for greater watchdog bite in power sector” that was published at the end of the day, I note the following passage: “Energy expert Paul McArdle agreed AGL and other companies had worked within the rules. However, to avoid the jump in wholesale prices since 2017, it required either a change of the rules or the market’s structure, he said.” This has pushed me a little further into the rabbit hole today, as a result of which I have invested some time today (27th March 2019) to piece this together. —– PS.. After posting this article I noted that Danny Price at Frontier Economics posted this article “Market Power Misdiagnosed” on 12th April 2019: (a) The short (5-page) paper is here . (b) The synopsis is here . Following from this, Bruce Mountain posted this short rebuttal of the Frontier claims on RenewEconomy in an article Hazelwood market analysis stacks up – consumers were well and truly “done over” on 16th April 2019. Voldemort is alive and well, it seems… If there are further developments (and I remember) I might update the table above. (A2) Some phrases that I don’t use This week (and also on prior occasions) I have noted that a number of people are keen to use a number of phrases to give some colour to claims that essentially amount to a view that generators have made too much profit as a result of some particular action. I note this use, but also want to make it clear that I try not to use these terms , as I don’t find them particularly helpful in assisting rational discussion (good for evoking an emotional response, if that is what you want to extract, though). Terms such as: “gaming the market” – this has been used in the past by others, but not sure I have heard it on this occasion. “price gouging” – pretty sure I have heard lots of this in the past couple days. “market manipulation” – I am especially keen to stay away from this one, as (my understanding is) it has a specific legal definition. I did note that Matthew Stevens wrote about “price manipulation” on Tuesday for instance. Also, as an aside, I note that Cole Latimer has referred to me as “energy expert” and I would like to note that I’m not an “energy expert”, and don’t like to be referred to as such: 1) My own sense is that it is an increasingly abused term, and that the quality of logic in any person’s contribute should determine the extent of consideration it is given. 2) Personally, I’m just someone driven to always understand more, so I continue asking questions (some of which might turn out to be useful). (B) What can I say, about prices after Hazelwood In my conversation with Cole (and in questions fielded from others this week) I did try to explain a number of things – though perhaps I was not as clear and concise as I would have hoped to have been. Today I hope the following will help with the clarity (I know I have not had enough time to make it concise). (B1) About following the rules In the SMH article it states that I “agreed AGL and other companies had worked within the rules”. To try to avoid any reader launching off in the wrong direction on this one, let me try to explain more clearly: 1) It is not our role to systematically investigate whether any particular generator is following the market rules in how they operate in the market. 2) In pursuing our broader mission of striving to understand complexity, to help others also understand we certainly invest a fair amount of time in watching the market, and in post-event analysis. 2a) On occasions where we see things that don’t make sense, we sometimes flag them with questions (more often direct to the parties involved – but sometimes in posts online, like this odd example here where actions seem mismatched to stated intention in the bid ). 2b) For the Generator Report Card , we have systematically reviewed portfolios which seem to have submitted bids “Not Well Formed” as one part of the AER’s latest Rebidding Guidelines. As time permits, we are trying to alert the portfolios flagged in the Report Card where they are highlighted in relation to metrics used For the avoidance of doubt, bids from AGL Energy seem to generally fit in the “Well Formed, if we use a looser interpretation” category – or, in plainer English, nothing to suggest not following the rules there. With that in mind, understand that what I said was something along the lines of “I’ve not seen anything to suggest that AGL was not following the NEM Rules in terms of how it bids in the market”. However what was lost in the translation was that this should not be taken to imply we’d done anything specific in reviewing outcomes post-Hazelwood, nor comprehensively reviewed bidding practices. We just don’t have the time. Hence we’re not in any real position to be definitive in “agreeing” that (AGL or) any generator follows the rules. (B2) About prices having increased Yes, wholesale prices have increased in the past 4-5 years in the NEM (retail prices are a whole other can of worms, and generally out of scope of what invest time in analysis). 1) I have already called b*llsh*t on claims by others that would seem to attribute this broader increase in pricing to [Insert Hobby Horse Here]. Astute readers will note that this almost 20-year trend included in that article shows that the kick in prices began around the start of 2015 – i.e. before the closure announcement for Hazelwood. 2) I have already also noted (reviewing Q2 2016 and then Q2 2017 ) that the pattern of prices has been changing in the NEM, due to a number of different factors. In July 2017 I posted about my own forecast of sorts about our energy transition train running off the rails as a result of the actions of a number of different villains . With this broader context, we see that the closure of Hazelwood was one step in a journey that has seen prices continue to rise. Any action taken (by AGL Energy or others) in response to the closure will only be one factor in these rises. Given the complexities inherent in the NEM (including challenges with understanding what would have otherwise been ) isolating cause-and-effect is more difficult than it might initially seem. (B3) Are prices (and profits) too high? Ask any shopper if they wanted the price for [INSERT PRODUCT] to be lower, then the answer will almost always be “YES!”. Electricity as a product/service is not really any different. (B3a) Concerns of Energy Users I have written numerous times how we’re particularly concerned that the recent escalation in wholesale pricing is bringing many additional challenges to the business of large energy use rs in the NEM (a growing number of whom are clients of ours). That’s why I can understand Andrew’s sentiment when he is quoted in that SMH article as follows: Andrew Richards, chief executive of the Energy Users Association of Australia, said the recommendations by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to curb any firm’s market share to 20 per cent were “10 years too late.” “There’s a pincer movement underway for energy users and we’ve exhausted every escape hatch,” Mr Richards said, referring to soaring gas and electricity prices. However I do read this and remember examples where energy users have not exactly used “every escape hatch” – like the time I suggested to the EUAA that they help organise a group of energy users to buy one of the NSW generation assets, which just happened to be on the sale block at the time (i.e. for the GenTrader contracts). 1) As it turned out, the Sunset Power business demonstrated how that might have happened…. 2) It was a different EUAA management team at the time, but my sense is that it is useful to keep these things in context. I also am personally aware of residential energy users who do find it quite difficult to meet their general cost of living (including cost of power), which was one of the reasons why we were initially very hesitant to sign up the very over-generous long-lasting 44c FIT for our residential rooftop system . At least there sanity has prevailed and the costs have been paid for by the QLD State Government, rather than smeared inequitably as a cost on all energy users. I did not the broader recommendations in the ACCC report with respect to rooftop solar. (B3b) Looking at the right numbers? More generally, though, I am also aware that there is an element of this concern in the broader group of energy sector observers and commentators that stems from a broader misunderstanding of the difference between “Pay as bid” model and “Marginal Price Setter” model for dispatch and market operations . These concerns manifest themselves in questions about why generation might be priced at $X/MWh in one dispatch interval and yet priced at $Y/MWh in another dispatch interval – with concern particularly noted if Y >> X. For the avoidance of doubt, readers should note that I am certainly not implying that the authors at the Victorian Energy Policy Centre suffer from this. (B3c) How much profit is “too much”? Leaving aside the challenge that profit and revenue are confused far too often in the broader society (including by prominent journalists sometimes) we eventually end up at the ultimate question about determining how much profit is “too much”. That’s a challenging question that I don’t really know how to answer – or even if an objective answer is actually possible. I’m far more confident that there would be a broad cross-section of different views amongst readers of this article, some with arguments more compelling than others. With the sudden increase tightness in the supply/demand balance arising from the closure announcement, it makes sense to me that both input costs and risks for the generation sector would have increased. What’s a “fair” price, revenue and profit outcome in a situation like this for all of the generators involved? (B4) If you wanted prices to be lower In the discussion this week, it does seem that the general view is that price outcomes are too high – and that they need to come down. Hence the way the conversation with Cole progressed, where it is noted that I said something along the lines of: However, to avoid the jump in wholesale prices since 2017, it required either a change of the rules or the market’s structure, he said.” The point I was trying to make here is that, if we assume that the generators were operating within the market rules (again, not my role to confirm this), then we would need to consider other options in order to reduce prices. Two of those options were mentioned there. Here’s some elaboration: Approach #1) Introduce more competition – by changing market structure In my conversation with Cole, I do remember noting that I’d seen that the ACCC had opposed both : Merger #1) The purchase by AGL Energy of Macquarie Generation: I saw Rod Sims’ comments in this coverage on the 7:30 Report on Monday night Merger #2) The 3-into-2 merger of QLD Government generators: In July 2017 I had identified this as one of the three factors contributing to the rise in wholesale prices in Queensland seen to that point. The effect of having a uniform shareholder across the combined Stanwell and CS portfolios was discussed here the month before. That’s also essentially the point that Angus Taylor was making in the interview tonight on 7:30 report with respect to Queensland GenCos. I’d made the point to Cole that one of the justifications given by renegade MPs for supporting a move to build a new coal-fired power station in northern Queensland was because the 2 remaining GenCos were achieving higher prices by [GOUGING, or other EMOTIVE PHRASE HERE]. I’d also noted that the move to create CleanCo as a third GenCo was being made, at least in part, to assuage those concerns. In general terms, having more competitors in the market will lead to more vigorous competition . What’s less immediately clear to me is the extent to which the bidding behaviour at Bayswater and Liddell would have been different in this specific case if the stations had been owned by an entity independent of AGL Energy all else being equal (i.e. faced with the same fuel supply constraints and so on). It might have been, as a portfolio with less capacity options, that they ended up being more conservative – knowing that they were faced with a conflict: 1) Knowing that the market would being relying on their capacity more, with the withdrawal of a large volume of current supply; but 2) Also knowing that they had limited stock of fuel and risks and increased costs of obtaining more. Perhaps we need to wind the clock back earlier, to wonder whether an independent generator would have been more risk averse and hence maintained a more robust coal stockpile, and more supply options (if that was possible). … though of course these sorts of thought exercises are in the impossible space of determining what would have otherwise been . These sorts of examples should be remembered as Case Studies (i.e. times when the market is under stress) to understand potential implications of future structural changes in the NEM. My recollection of the little that I saw at the time is that this sort of approach was not really used at the Competition Tribunal when the AGL merger with MacGen was passed through several years ago. Approach #2) Introduce more competition – by building more capacity Additional supply capacity would also deliver competition benefits – especially if operated by independent parties. The added value of independence is one reason I was pleased to see this note in the Government’s announcement of its 12 (+1 dark horse* ) project shortlist under FUNGI program: …and the Government decided not to pursue proposals submitted by generators/retailers that currently hold significant market share, in line with the recommendation by the ACCC Again it’s the times when the market’s under stress that the value of the additional capacity might be more apparent – but this comes hand-in-hand with the related question about how much is enough insurance, as that capacity comes at a cost? * About the Dark Horse, possibly the Dhalgan Energy Park For reasons discussed here , northern Queensland would not be the location I would be choosing to build my own large generator if I wanted to achieve either (or both): (a) Help to lower wholesale prices for energy users; and (b) To earn a reasonable return. That’s the point I was hoping to make in this exchange here today about the feasibility study into proposed generation capacity in northern Queensland: It doesn’t matter whether the plant is fired by coal or powered by the sun (or even a mix of solar, wind and hydro). If it’s going to be located north of Rockhampton, it would be bumping into the same general limitations. More generally, we continue to reflect in our Generator Report Card process (as part of the new capacity we see that’s entered the NEM over its 20 year history and the reasoning behind that) on the reasons why we seem to have arrived at a situation where we have a tight supply/demand balance arising as a result of an unscripted departure of a large contributor to the energy mix – hence Approach #4 below. My sense in reading some commentary about Hazelwood is that some view its former contribution as “only” 5% of the energy NEM-wide as if: (a) That percentage was small; and (b) That the exit of such a volume should not have caused any major digestion issues. If that’s the case, then I have a contrary view – given that averages mask and lot of very important nuances at the extremes in what’s a very volatile electricity market. Approach #3) Change the rules? Of course, it would be possible to change the rules to achieve lower prices – there are a broad number of changes that could be made to achieve this (a fair number canvassed by people over the years). Unfortunately there are many fewer options that would be “in the long term interests of energy users, with respect to …” (i.e. fulfilling the NEO). To take it to the (comical) extreme to make the point clear, it would be theoretically possible to change the rules to say that the wholesale price outcomes should always be set at $0/MWh. Such an approach inevitably just ends up with: (a) The supply side exiting the market (or looking for some form of subsidy to prop up their business – be that capacity payment, or other form of support); and (b) On the demand side we see poor choices made that end up coming to bite us later when prices are reset to (perhaps) “more realistic” levels (e.g. poor energy efficiency embedded structurally into our economy at many different levels). Whilst it might be easy for readers to see that such a hypothetical approach would not be sustainable (in the long-term interests of energy users) some of the rule changes that have been proposed in the past, and are probably being dreamed up in response to the latest concerns, would (though more subtle) also raise similar questions. Leaving aside the (very valid and necessary) questions about how effectively they do their job (I’ve already provided my constructive feedback in the AEMC’s survey), that’s one reason why I am a keen supporter of having an independent body assess rule change proposals and determine if they are (in their considered view) in the long term interests of energy users. Approach #4) Governments set durable policy, and stop tripping over its clumsy feet! A couple months ago, all we seemed to hear about was the Federal Government taking their own “big stick” to the “price gouging” energy companies (their own form of magic wand , perhaps). However the more they spoke about “big stick” the more I pictured the current Federal Government as the clumsy dancing partner on the dance floor trampling over every else with two left feet and oversized shoes . Clearly earning their status as Villain no1 in our energy transition train-wreck. With this as our starting point, I am forever hopeful that we can find a way for governments to assume their role as direction setters for the broader energy sector transition, whilst resisting the (irresistible?) urge to meddle in the details. One glimmer of hope, then, in the COAG Energy Council direction to the ESB to be a bit more strategic in implementing NEM 2.0 by 2025 . This would surely help to achieve Approach #2 (more capacity, of the right sort) and might even help the AEMC take a more strategic view with Approach #3 (evolving the rules in parallel with the transition). Who knows, we might see more rational market structures evolve as well (Approach #1). ———————- … and on that note, it’s back to the Generator Report Card. A big thanks for the patience shown by the growing number of clients who have pre-ordered the report at early-bird pricing whilst we do all that’s necessary to complete the report ( information about the status is here ).",

    "content": "In the office early this morning to continue the analysis and insight generation for our Generator Report Card , I glanced across to the NEMwatch v10 dashboard running in our office and noted the large wad of green colour on the trended “generation by fuel type” widget within the application.

    "title": "Price Setting Concepts – an Explainer",
    "date": "22-03-2019 12:21:00 PM",
    "content": "Paul and the Global-Roam team have produced a great introductory guide to the fundamentals of the NEM’s price setting and dispatch process , and more recently an intermediate guide covering some of the real-world complexities resulting from this process, based on analysis of AEMO’s Price Setter data files. In this explainer, I want to focus on a few of the key concepts needed to bridge the gap between the basic ideas behind price setting via least-cost dispatch and how this plays out in the results we see in the NEM, as described in Paul’s intermediate guide . I’ll be covering: the underlying principle in the NEM (and many other markets) that spot prices are the incremental (marginal) cost of supplying the next unit of demand , how transmission losses, both within regions and between interconnected regions, are treated in the dispatch process and affect NEM price outcomes, why, and how, prices in multiple NEM regions can often be set by the same single generating unit or group of units located in just one region, and how physical limitations of the transmission network and other constraints can impact on the price-setting process and price outcomes. In a later followup piece, building on these principles, I intend to cover more complex cases including why we not infrequently see prices being set by generating units at multiple stations which may be located in separate regions, and how spot energy prices can be affected by the NEM’s associated frequency control ancillary services markets Least Cost Dispatch – Core Principles The first discussion point above is crucial, because it underpins just about every other aspect of the price-setting process and outcomes that we see in the NEM. Most of us are introduced to marginally priced markets like the NEM through the “bid-stacking” analogy. Here’s just one of many ways this can be illustrated, showing prices being set over time: Offers to supply volumes of power are “stacked” like blocks in order of increasing price, with the height of each block representing offer volume, creating a bidstack ; the aggregated demand level is overlaid, and just enough offers are accepted – dispatched – so that the cumulative volume of dispatched offers just equals the demand to be supplied at the end of each dispatch interval . The price of the last, highest-priced offer accepted in each interval – the marginal offer – sets the market price, and dispatch volumes for each supplier are simply the aggregate of its accepted offers. If we assign a cost to each accepted offer, being its offer price multiplied by its volume (or part-volume in the case of the marginal offer), then two results should be obvious: least cost dispatch : for this simple case, dispatching offers by “moving up the bidstack” in increasing price order to meet demand yields the supply combination which has the lowest total cost (where total cost is simply the sum of accepted offer costs), and price = marginal cost : the price of the marginal offer which sets the market price is also the marginal (incremental) cost of supplying one further unit of demand (where this unit is just a very small fraction of total demand and typical offer sizes). Bid-stacking works perfectly well in very simple situations where there are no limitations on which bids can be accepted. But a real world setting like the NEM has many practical limitations. Victoria has enough generation capacity to cover combined Victorian and Tasmanian demand most of the time. But even if all Victorian generators offered at prices below the cheapest Tasmanian generator, it would not be possible for Basslink to physically carry enough power to supply Tasmania by itself. So some Tasmanian generation always has to be dispatched regardless of its offer pricing relative to Victorian generators. In cases where simple bid-stacking doesn’t readily apply, the principles used for dispatch and pricing still embody the two observations above: dispatch is based on the least-cost combination of offers which meets demand and satisfies the physical limitations of the system; spot prices are defined as the marginal cost of meeting an additional unit of demand under this least-cost rule, which is the difference in total cost between the original least-cost combination and the least-cost combination for one extra unit of demand. If you don’t see what I did there, re-read the last point. There’s no reliance in that definition on a single “marginal offer” which directly sets the spot price. Some of the time it may be that simple; in other cases, meeting an additional unit of demand at least cost can involve changing dispatch volumes (and hence costs) by varying amounts across multiple offers within that least-cost combination, with no single offer “setting the price” by itself – examples to follow below. One final and important point – although the concepts of offer cost, total cost, and least cost used above are based on valuing each offer at its offer price, payments to NEM generators for all offers dispatched in a given region and trading interval are based on the common regional spot price, not their individual offer prices. “Costs” calculated from offer prices are fundamental to the logic of the dispatch process, but don’t represent the financial cost of energy in the NEM. Least cost dispatch with marginal cost pricing is a process intended to foster competition for dispatch and seek the most economically efficient balancing of demand and supply – for more discussion on this topic see Paul’s article on approaches to market dispatch and pricing . Price Setting in Practice – Intra-Regional and Inter-Regional Loss Treatment Once you’re across the concept that NEM prices are the marginal cost of meeting one more megawatt-hour of demand , many of the complexities of price setting – and even AEMO’s price setter data – become much easier to grasp. Let’s start with treatment of losses, both within regions (intra-regional) and over interconnections (inter-regional). Conceptually, NEM generators and regions look like this in the dispatch process: Generators in each region are treated like spokes on a wheel, connected to a central hub which is the Regional Reference Node (RRN) . These are not physical transmission connections (which are usually a much more complex mesh). The hub-spoke relationships simply assign each generator to one and only one RRN, and also embody Marginal Loss Factors representing the effect of incremental intra-regional transmission losses – under “typical” or “average” conditions. An MLF represents the power that would effectively be delivered at the RRN – after losses – when one additional megawatt is injected at the generator location. (For a great in-depth discussion of MLFs see this recent piece by Ben Skinner of the Australian Energy Council. ) Treatment of Intra-Regional Losses In dispatch, MLFs are treated as fixed, and are not used – as one might expect – to adjust offer volumes for losses; instead they are applied to “raw” offer prices (in principle a generator’s minimum price for delivering a megawatt-hour into the network at its physical location ) to yield loss-adjusted effective offer prices at the Regional Reference Node. For a generator in a location where power typically flows towards the RRN, offer prices are adjusted upwards (divided by an MLF which is less than 1 for such locations), to reflect power lost between the generator and the RRN. For a generator in a load-heavy region to which power normally flows from the RRN, offer prices are adjusted downwards (divided by an MLF greater than 1), since local generation reduces losses otherwise incurred in transmitting power to that location from the RRN. In analysis and discussion of generator offers, we almost always refer to MLF-adjusted effective prices “at the RRN”, since these are directly comparable across generators and are the prices used to determine least-cost dispatch. A corollary of this treatment is that the actual location of demand and supply volumes within a region can be ignored in the dispatch process. All supply and demand volumes are treated (and measured) on a “generator terminal” basis as though those generators were at the common regional node, with the economic impact of losses accounted for in the effective offer prices. Finally, spot prices determined at the RRN are then multiplied by each generator’s MLF to yield the actual price paid to each generator for its energy. The following diagram provides an example of how this all works in practice: nb This treatment is quite different to electricity markets like New Zealand’s which have a full “nodal pricing” model in which the transmission network, generator and demand locations, and losses are more fully represented in the dispatch process, yielding an explicit set of locational spot prices and network flows for every dispatch interval. Inter-Regional Transfers and Losses Between regions which have one or more direct transmission interconnections, inter-regional losses are treated very differently in the NEM dispatch process. It was recognised from the outset of the NEM design that flows between regions would be highly variable depending on supply demand balance and prices offered within each region, and that more dynamic treatment of flows, losses and price outcomes would be necessary to properly satisfy the least-cost objective for dispatch, and to optimise the value of power transfers between regions. Without going into full detail, the dispatch process uses dynamic inter-regional loss factors across interconnections which vary with the level and direction of flows. As flows from one region to another increase, the incremental (marginal) losses in transferring an extra unit of power also increase. And if flows reverse, losses do not become negative and along with marginal losses again start increasing with the magnitude of flows. This is all summarised by a quadratic loss curve : The NEM dispatch process uses these loss characteristics (with specific parameters for each interconnection) in seeking its least-cost solution. If the price of offers in one region allows power to be supplied into another region at lower overall cost than dispatching offers in the importing region, taking increasing marginal losses into account , then the exporting region offers will be preferentially dispatched, up to the point where either: demand in each region is fully satisfied by local generation +/- transfers, cheaper offers in the exporting region are exhausted, transfers increase just to the level where increasing marginal losses offset the exporting region’s price advantage, or physical network transfer limits are reached. Following this logic allows the NEM dispatch process to find a combination of generation dispatch and inter-regional transfers across the entire NEM that achieves overall least cost for balancing supply and demand in each region. The resulting regional spot prices, and the relationships between them, can best be understood by referring back to the definition of each region’s spot price as the marginal cost of meeting additional demand in that region . The following charts take the relatively simple case of two interconnected regions, and step through the price formation process in both exporting and importing regions, starting from this basic definition of spot price. In the first pair of charts, the lowest cost source of incremental supply for both regions (symbolised as a part-loaded generator) is located in the exporting region – you can think of this as corresponding to case 1) above: In the second pair of charts – perhaps after demand in both regions has increased – the lowest cost available source is now located in the importing region – corresponding to case 2) above. Marginal interconnection losses are also higher: A few important observations from these examples: In each case, a common generator offer determines the spot price in both regions Regardless of which region the price setter is in, the ratio between the importing region spot price and the exporting region spot price equals the marginal loss factor across the interconnection (if it’s not fully clear why, step through the calculation of spot prices for each region, which may involve adjusting interconnector flows and increasing generation in the other region to achieve least cost dispatch). For the assumed change of +1 in demand volume, the spot price can be expressed as a change in supply volume multiplied by an offer price ; but the change in supply volume may differ from 1 – again because of losses. Understanding this process makes some real world AEMO price-setter data – at least in simple dispatch cases – easier to understand. Here’s an actual NEM dispatch interval, as seen in ez2view, where prices in all five NEM regions are being set by a single South Australian generator : And here’s the corresponding AEMO Price Setter data showing that a single offer at $85.80/MWh from Pelican Point in South Australia (PPCCGT) was setting the energy price for all NEM regions at this time: The “Increase” column shows the changes in dispatch volume for this offer required to satisfy a one megawatt demand change in each region respectively: a value of one for South Australia, being Pelican Point’s home region values greater than one for Victoria and Tasmania because those regions are each importing power from South Australia across the relevant interconnectors (in the case of Tasmania, the Increase reflects compounding of marginal losses across the SA-Vic and Vic-Tas interconnections) values less than one for NSW and Queensland because those regions are exporting towards Victoria. Meeting incremental demand of one megawatt in either of those regions involves reducing its exports by one megawatt and increasing Pelican Point generation by enough to offset the reduction in imports received in Victoria; as imports received in Victoria are significantly less than exports from either NSW or Qld due to losses, the net effect is that the reduction in imports can be covered by an increase in Pelican Point generation of less than 1, even after allowing for losses between SA and Victoria. You can check this at home if you like, by remembering that the ratio between adjoining regional spot prices equals the marginal loss factor for each interconnection, and working out the relevant volume changes region-by-region. In each case you can also check that each regional spot price is Pelican Point’s offer price of $85.80/MWh multiplied by the relevant “Increase” value, the result of which is shown in the “Band Cost” column. For anyone wondering about the “T-V-MNSP1,TAS1” entry for Tasmania – it’s technicality to do with the way Basslink is dispatched but in this case it makes no difference to the price outcome, so ignore it. Constrained Interconnectors What happens in case 4) above where physical transfer limits across an interconnection are reached? This is usually pretty easy, since in this case each region reverts to having separate price setting offers: Note that I’ve increased the price of the marginal offer in Region 2, just to emphasise than when an interconnection becomes constrained , price differences are no longer related to interconnector marginal loss factors. A More Complex Case to Finish I’d hoped to cover a little more in this instalment, but one final teaser to finish with. Let’s now assume that in the constrained interconnection case above, the limit on flow across that interconnection is not a fixed value, but varies depending on how some generators in one or other region are dispatched. This is actually the case for many important security and capacity limits on flows between NEM regions. For simplicity, let’s assume that increasing output from the marginal generator in Region 2 by one megawatt permits additional interconnection flow sufficient to deliver an extra one megawatt of import (after marginal losses) to Region 2. Finally let’s assume that at this flow level, marginal losses are 20% so that an additional 1.2 megawatts needs to be dispatched in Region 1 per megawatt received in Region 2. Given these assumptions, here’s the marginal cost derivation for meeting an additional megawatt of demand in Region 2: In this more complex case, the Region 2 spot price is now a “blend” of different offer prices, and meeting one extra megawatt of demand involves changes in offer dispatch at multiple generators in different regions which depend on both losses and also on the precise nature of the variable limit – or constraint – on interconnector flows. This is an example of “Category 3” in Paul’s taxonomy of price setter outcomes , and as Paul’s statistics showed, situations like this occur surprisingly often in the NEM. ——————————————- About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

    "title": "A twenty year review of Marginal Loss Factors",
    "date": "11-03-2019 08:16:00 AM",
    "content": "Last week the AEMO released a draft of the Marginal Loss Factors (MLFs) that would apply to both generation and loads connected to the NEM. This page on the AEMO site links to more details . On that page, the AEMO notes: “The NEM is transforming, driven by new technology and a changing generation mix, newly formed supply hubs, leading to large year-on-year changes in MLFs. In many locations, MLFs have fallen by large margins , which in turn have material financial implications for existing and intending market participants.” Well, the “fallen by large margins” comment has been echoed loud and clear in various pockets of social media. Concurrently with this latest furore, we’ve been focusing our efforts to incorporate a 20-year review of Marginal Loss Factors as part of the compilation of our extensive Generator Report Card (MLFs are just one of dozens of other metric we’re assembling, some of which are described here ) . (A) MLF coverage in the Generator Report Card Over the past couple days we (i.e. the authors ) have tried to avoid getting sucked into the rabbit hole of endless social media, and rather invest time to deliver insights more efficiently and effectively through our 20-year review in the Generator Report Card. We weren’t wholly successful in avoiding the distractions, but are pleased to note that our analysis has been extended with more insights to share with readers of the Report Card – over time, and down to individual details of discrete DUIDs (units within power stations). We’re looking forward to delivering these insights to the growing number of people who have pre-ordered the Report Card at “early-bird” pricing and are waiting patiently (thanks!) for their electronic access to be made available. However for WattClarity readers at the start of the week, I thought it might be useful to share this 20-year trend of the extremes in MLFs in order to provide some context: As can be seen, across all DUIDs in the NEM as they have existed at the end of every month over the past 20 years, there has been a fair range of MLFs across all time. It’s not just a recent development that loss factors have varied significantly – depending on a generator’s choice of location , and their choice of a particular connection to the grid (e.g. connection voltage). 1) Every year over the past 20 years, some generators have been rewarded for locating where there has been a relative scarcity of generation options, hence earning an MLF above 1.0 and hence receiving what’s essentially a bonus on the MWh production sent-out from the station gate. 2) Also every year over the past 20 years, other generators have essentially been penalized for locating where there is (especially after their entry) an over-abundance of generation compared to the local size of consumption, hence earning an MLF below 1.0 and essentially having their production discounted due to losses on transmission (and in some cases distribution) lines back to where the load is. Whilst the specifics of the exact numbers are complex and require sophisticated modelling to determine, the directionality of the numbers should be fairly common sense and is along the lines of Business 101: Rule #1) Locate close to where the customer is, or pay the transport cost (which, in this case, includes losses). Rule #2) If you choose to build remote from your customer, and other competitors also come in afterwards to also build in the same place, then you are all going to suffer more. Yet there was a surprise and outcry back in mid-2018 when loss factors changed – as a result of which I posted this attempt to help address Villain no 4 at the time . In his “Lessons from the trenches” article from September 2018 , Jonathon Dyson notes (about MLFs) that: “physics of the power system beats financial models every day of the week” (B) The current buzz on social media We have noted the furore about the nature of the changes that have been heralded in last week’s AEMO announcements – and especially the claims that these were unexpected and appear unfair. For our future reference, I have linked in the following particular discussions, which we might come back to in another few weeks to review commentary then in the light of the content we have included in the Generator Report Card (i.e. to ascertain whether the content we have completed will assist in answering the questions posed online for those who have arranged access to the Report Card): 1) There’s this article “Wind and solar plants hit by massive de-ratings in congested grid” on RenewEconomy , though to be clear readers should note that it’s not particularly that the grid is congested that MLFs have changed but because losses are high (congestion is, related, but also a whole other can of worms, and another metric we are assessing ) . 2) On Twitter I noted a number of exchanges (particularly this exchange started by Kane Thornton + its many tangents like this one ), but there are bound to be many others. 3) On LinkedIn there were also a number of exchanges ( this one started by Dan Brown and this one by Glenne Drover ) but it’s likely there will be others as well. If our readers know of other worthwhile discussions going on that we should be aware of, please add them in as comments below – or, let us know directly/privately via our feedback form (or just call us on +61 7 3368 4064 ). (C) Some information provided by the AEMO For those who want to know more straight away, a great place to start would be these AEMO reference documents: “Treatment of Loss Factors in the National Electricity Market” from 1st July 2012 … paying particular attention to sections 4 and 5. “Forward-Looking Transmission Loss Factors” from 8th February 2017 … see section 5. It’s also worth noting that the AEMO clearly cautions on page 27 of the document “Draft Marginal Loss Factors: FY 2019-20” from March 2019 that: “As more generation is connected to electrically weak areas of the network that are remote from the regional reference node, then the MLFs in these areas will continue to decline .” (with my emphasis added) I have not checked to see if a similar warning was clearly provided in the documentation in mid 2018 – however now that this warning has been so clearly provided here surely no-one can claim surprise in future (e.g. come mid 2020, when the updates are released and a range of MLFs for remote power stations continue to decline – including the possibility of significant drops in northern Queensland ?) (D) Rule Change Proposals at the AEMC Two rule change proposals submitted to the AEMC in recent times that are related to the current concerns about MLFs (and both submitted by Adani Renewables) are as follows: On 5th February 2019, Adani Renewables submitted an application to change from a marginal loss factor framework ( intra -regional) to an average loss factor framework . Details are here under AEMC Reference ERC0262 . On 7th December 2018, Adani Renewables submitted an application to change the allocation of Inter- Regional Settlement Residues that accrue due to MLF inaccuracie s to ensure generators are also able to receive allocations. Details are here under AEMC Reference ERC0251 . (E) Explanatory Article at the AEC Also worth noting that Ben Skinner at the Australian Energy Council has (on Thursday 14th March) provided this article explaining some of the underlying logic for how MLFs are calculated and why they are used . Worth reading for context. ——————– That’s all for now – it’s back to the Generator Report Card…",

    "title": "A (Much) Deeper Dive into Friday March 1 2019",
    "date": "08-03-2019 02:00:00 PM",
    "content": "Paul has posted a couple of timely and succinct pieces analysing NEM events last Friday in Victoria and South Australia, where hot weather in both states saw significant price volatility and some interesting generator dispatch patterns during a brief period of negative dispatch prices . In this much longer piece (apologies, there’s no test at the end though), I’ll try to wrap up a fuller overview of the day and also take a closer look at some structural and behavioural issues evident on the day that illustrate the complexity and highly dynamic nature of the NEM spot market. There’ll be a lot of charts here, many drawn from Global Roam’s ez2view market viewer and its companion web-based trend charting engine. Overview and Leadup Let’s start with a couple of ez2view trend charts covering the main period of price volatility in the two states: These look almost identical apart from the shape and scale on the demand lines. In particular the price levels in both states (shown at 5 minute dispatch and 30 minute trading granularity) followed each other through the day, differing only due to the impact of interconnector marginal losses between the regions. On the other hand prices in the other three NEM regions were unremarkable, excepting a couple of brief periods of negative dispatch prices in Tasmania (driven by those negative prices in Vic / SA). So for most intents and purposes the two regions behaved as one larger “economic island” on this day. There are a few versions of “demand” on these charts (see Paul’s explainer for a very detailed description of the NEM’s many flavours of demand ). The thicker brown line is 5 minute dispatch interval demand (labelled “metered” as it derives from actual measured inputs to the system from large scale generators and interconnectors – at system level we always measure demand via inputs to, not withdrawals from, the power grid). The smoother lines are 30-minute measures which average these input values across six dispatch intervals. The higher “operational consumption” lines add in AEMO’s estimates of rooftop solar PV production to indicate total usage. Note how this consumption measure is considerably higher – because of the large rooftop PV capacity installed in both states, over 1,400 MW in Victoria and 1,000 MW in South Australia – and that it peaks much earlier in the afternoon and at a higher level than demand seen on the grid itself. A consequence of this effect is that although additional rooftop PV installations will continue to reduce grid demand levels through the middle part of the day, from here forward they will have progressively less and less impact on the size and timing of grid demand peaks, which are now occurring at late afternoon / early evening times when rooftop PV is producing only a relatively small fraction of its capacity. On the other hand widespread adoption of battery storage could make significant changes to the character of grid demand peaks. One thing that’s evident in the Victorian 5-minute demand profile are noticeable falls around the time of some of the price spikes, at 14:05 (NEM time – which is AEST, not daylight saving), 15:45, and from 17:05. The last, largest dip measures about 360 MW or roughly 4%. These may be evidence of some demand side response to high spot prices although the last one might also reflect a weak cool change going through Melbourne just after 6pm local time (17:00 NEM time): More on demand response later. Looking at demand levels in historical context is useful to get a sense of whether the high prices reflect extreme demands or other factors. For comparison in the following charts I’ve picked the two days of highest historical grid demand in each state (going back to 2009 and 2014 for Victoria, 2009 and 2011 for SA), as well as the two days on which load shedding occurred in Victoria this January : This shows that for Victoria, March 1 was fairly similar to Thursday Jan 24 2019, but well below historical peaks and Friday Jan 25 2019 (where extensive load curtailment / shedding and then an early cool change restricted demand from reaching the much higher levels for which it was clearly headed. In South Australia March 1 was not as extreme a day as Jan 24 2019 or historical maximum days (Jan 25 is not shown as temperatures in SA were much lower): Finally looking at combined region demands confirms that March 1 was relatively close to, but slightly more benign than January 24: Without rehashing the gory details of January 24-25, the principal reason those days saw voluntary load curtailment and forced shedding, accompanied by longer periods of extreme spot price, was the coincidence of outages at multiple brown coal generation units in Victoria, along with higher demands. There were no significant generation outages affecting supply on March 1. So what drove the high prices that occurred, and were they expected? Using ez2view ’s time-travel functionality to wind the clock back to the prior Thursday afternoon, we can see AEMO’s “ predispatch ” forecasts for Victoria showing high demands (dark grey), relatively little spare generation (light grey, noting that this doesn’t include interconnector import capability), and an extended period of forecast extreme prices. But the same forecast was also showing extreme prices for Thursday afternoon, which didn’t eventuate: However the demand forecast in this outlook was about 280 MW lower than eventuated. A broader sense of how forecasts evolved leading up to Friday can be gleaned from ez2view ’s Forecast Convergence tool, here showing a series of demand forecasts made at 9am on the day and on preceding days of the week: The corresponding chart for South Australia shows a similar pattern, with peak demand forecasts progressively rising closer to the day. In fact AEMO had previously alerted the market to this uncertainty in forecast weather and demand conditions, via a fairly unusual form of market notice issued on Tuesday afternoon: Forecast convergence for available generation is a more mixed picture and a bit harder to interpret because generation forecasts for more than 24 hours ahead in this view do not include an estimate of semi-scheduled generation output (large scale wind and solar): However the main conclusion is that there were no dramatic changes in available scheduled generation leading up to last Friday. During days preceding Friday, AEMO did issue some forecast Lack of Reserve (LOR) notices for Victoria, which can be summarised as: Wednesday afternoon – forecast LOR2 notice for 16:30-17:00 Friday, cancelled just 90 minutes later Thursday afternoon – forecast LOR1 notice (reserve 81 MW below threshold) for 16:00-18:00 Friday Friday – minor updates to forecast LOR1 condition; actual LOR1 declared 16:30-17:00. As LOR1 means that the system is still two contingencies (eg loss of two large generating units) away from falling into an “insecure state”, potentially requiring forced load shedding, the conclusion from these notices is that the physical supply position remained relatively robust, although with less headroom than usual, throughout Friday. This contrasts with the events of January 24-25 where actual LOR3 conditions (load being shed) occurred on both days. Supply Contributions by Source Type To give an overview of how different generation sources, demand, and interconnector flows played out across the two states on March 1, the following chart summarises demand, supply, and price for the two states combined: This shows steady output from brown coal generation, while gas (here including liquid fuels) and hydro plants together with imports from Tasmania and NSW provided the swing to cover rising demand and decreases in wind generation through the day as well as falling rooftop PV output in the afternoon/evening period. The large decrease in wind generation through the day is not uncommon on hot summer days, and was pretty well captured in AEMO’s forecasts over the preceding week, shown in this Forecast Convergence view (this also includes large scale solar, but the numbers are currently dominated by wind capacity): For South Australia the picture is very similar: While people on one end of Paul’s Emotion-o-meter would paint this falling wind output as a villain of the piece in tightening supply-demand balance last Friday and contributing to the chance of higher prices, others would point to its relative predictability, at least in this instance (better than the demand forecast uncertainties shown earlier), and to the fact that reliability assessments or price forecasts should never assume that wind will supply anything like its nominal capacity at times of system stress – unlike dispatchable sources, this was never intended to be one of its functions in the supply system. To summarise so far, March 1 had high but not extreme demands, and an adequate supply position – despite decreasing wind and solar output through the afternoon. Where next to look for high price drivers? Participant bids. Bidding Behaviour Bidding behaviour in the NEM is by design highly dynamic, with participants able to continually adjust (rebid) volumes offered across ten price bands for each generating unit in near-real time up to a few minutes before dispatch (the price levels for those bands having been locked in day-ahead). Ez2view provides the capability to visualise and drill into the many thousands of offers and rebids made on any day in full detail, interval by interval and unit by unit. I’ll focus here on an overview and pick out a couple of examples of rebidding. We start with an aggregated overview of offers from thermal and hydro generators across Vic and SA captured at 12:00 on Friday, just ahead of the period of price volatility. This shows lots of volume offered at or below $0/MWh (blue area) and a significant volume – around 2,000 MW – offered at 5-digit prices (red area). The period of forecast extreme prices (as per the earlier predispatch chart) corresponds to the region on this chart where the grey dispatch line falls into the red area: After the event taking into account all rebids made across the day the corresponding view shows: This shows that as events unfolded, participants rebid more volume down to market floor price levels (negative $1,000/MWh) in order to maximise their dispatch, but also left material volumes – around 1,000 to 1,400 MW – offered at 5-digit price levels. In intervals where these offer bands were required to be dispatched to meet demand, extreme spot prices ensued. This reinforces the point that extreme prices eventuated not because of physical supply shortfall – with over 1,000 MW of available supply mostly undispatched – but because that remaining supply was only offered at very high price levels. Also seen in the ex-post chart are a few short periods where significantly higher volumes were suddenly and briefly rebid down to low price levels – these rebids were responsible for the negative dispatch prices seen a couple of times in the afternoon and were driven by the so-called “ 5/30 effect ” which we’ve previously analysed extensively on this site (eg here and here ). Interconnectors Given the relatively low prices in adjoining NEM regions, you’d assume that flows on interconnectors from those regions into Victoria (and indirectly into South Australia) were at maximum levels during the period of volatility – here’s an ez2view NEM overview snapshot for the 17:00 dispatch interval: The Basslink interconnector from Tasmania is indeed flowing at its current maximum capacity of 478 MW, which it did throughout the afternoon, but looking closely one might wonder why the interconnection from NSW is carrying only 25 MW into Victoria – surely it has a higher capacity than that? In fact an ez2view time series view of flows and limits on this interconnection is fascinating: We can see that at times during Friday afternoon, despite high demand and high prices in Victoria, flows were actually being forced northward into NSW, and at no time were significant southward flows permitted by the limits on the interconnection. Contrast this with the situation later overnight and through Saturday where the interconnection could carry around 1,000 MW southwards into Victoria. What’s going on? The full answer is very complicated but in short there are two main factors at work: There is a complex “voltage stability limit” on southward flows across this interconnection which at times – such as Friday afternoon – restricts its use to securely carry power out of NSW. The limit is really nothing to do with the physical (“thermal”) capacity of the relevant transmission lines, but is required to ensure overall system security and stability would be maintained in the event of a major disturbance causing rapidly increased southwards flows – such as would occur on the sudden trip of a large Victorian generator. This is represented as the “N^^V_NIL_1” constraint shown in the bottom right quarter. No time to decode this one further here though. When generation from Snowy Hydro’s Murray power stations and AGL’s hydro stations in north-east Victoria is high and flowing southwards to meet high Victorian demand, as it was on Friday, there may be very little spare thermal capacity left on the transmission lines carrying this flow to also carry additional imports from NSW, particularly in hot weather which reduces these lines’ physical capacity (this limitation was particularly relevant back on January 24-25). In situations like last Friday, one or other of these limitations can dramatically reduce the capability of the NEM’s northern states to supply more power into Victoria and South Australia – just when they could do with more. Resolving constraints like these – and the economics of doing so – are complex engineering and analytical questions but no doubt on the radar of AEMO and transmission providers, especially in the context of Snowy 2.0. It may well be though that the more economic answer in the short term at least is simply more dispatchable capacity (generation, storage, or demand response) located in Victoria and / or South Australia. Some Miscellaneous Observations In the remainder of this post, I’ll focus on a couple of detailed aspects of outcomes from last Friday, given they garnered a bit of discussion in the immediate aftermath. Demand Response Near the top of this post I promised to discuss the apparent demand response seen in Victoria. This would be worth post in itself but given time constraints I’m going to leave you with one chart which I’ve assembled from AEMO’s extraordinarily granular (and large) 4-second dataset : The 4-second dataset happens to provide data for Victoria’s Portland Aluminium Smelter (“APD”), and it clearly shows that a lot – although not all – of the significant step changes in Victorian demand last Friday corresponded to changes in the smelter’s load. It would appear that there are contractual / financial arrangements or incentives for the smelter to reduce its load at times of high spot price, which we can see happening from the 15:00 – 15:30 trading interval onwards. It’s a little surprising to see the smelter load increase just after 16:30 while prices are still at extreme levels, before its load drops again just before 17:00. However there are technical restrictions on how long supply reductions to individual smelter potlines can be sustained, and it’s possible that the increase shown was part of managing that process. No doubt there were other demand response actions happening across this day (eg those evident around the very first price spike at 14:05), but this appears to have been the largest one. What did batteries do? While still only a small part of the system, it’s worth looking at responses of the four large-scale batteries now installed and operational in Victoria and South Australia: I haven’t had the opportunity to look too closely at why, but only the Hornsdale (Tesla) battery in South Australia and to a lesser extent the Ballarat battery in Victoria supplied power into most of the periods of extreme price (pink areas). The Gannawarra facility shares its transmission connection with the adjacent large-scale solar farm and its ability to supply was probably constrained down significantly because the solar farm was producing at near full capacity in these periods. Note that 1 hour of just 20 MW supply constraint represents foregone revenue of nearly $300,000. In the case of the Dalrymple North battery, no real idea about the absence of supply from 4pm although given the absence of any charging activity I wonder if it was flat by then! Generation Response to Negative Prices Paul has posted on this issue already but has asked me to look a little deeper. This chart of 5 minute generation, price and net interconnector flows for Victoria across the period of price volatility shows generally steady generation levels in that region, with gas and hydro dispatch rising steadily across the afternoon, falling wind as previously discussed, and net interconnector flows (on the lower panel) switching from export to import as Victorian demand rose. However there are some clear dips in brown coal generation and large scale solar associated with the negative dispatch prices at the back end of the 30 minute trading intervals ending at 14:30 (highlighted), where we also see an abrupt shift from net interconnector exports to imports, and at 17:30: Seen at this granularity these generation dips are not surprising – with the dispatch price set at -$1,000/MWh in Victoria, even generators with volumes offered down at this lowest possible price level are competing against one another for dispatch and might expect to see volumes reduced. Generators with higher bids should expect to see no volumes at all allocated to them in these intervals (except that ramp rate constraints and other complex factors can prevent them being turned off completely). But what is quite surprising is the increase in imports into Victoria while prices are at this lowest possible level. Why should more power be flowing into a region where the market price is the minimum possible? Looking at the corresponding picture for South Australia further questions emerge: Look at the 14:00-14:30 trading interval highlighted. After the price spike in the first 5 minutes of this interval, generators in both South Australia and Victoria rebid volumes down to -$1,000/MWh to maximise dispatch (the 5/30 effect ). We saw above that Victorian generators lost volume despite this, and here we can see that the reason was that the NEM dispatch algorithm chose to dispatch way more gas- and liquid-fuelled generation in South Australia, reversing flows on the interconnectors to Victoria from net imports of over 700 MW to net exports of about 200 MW, and forcing down generation in Victoria (and also Tasmania, not shown). But prices in SA at -$800/MWh to -$900/MWh were above prices in Victoria at -$1,000/MWh, so it seems this change in flows was uneconomic – increasing output in the higher price region and decreasing it in the lower price region. And anyway, why weren’t prices in SA set at -$1,000/MWh given that’s where most volume was being bid?? Even stranger, flows on one link of the Victoria-SA interconnection – Murraylink – were going one way and flows on the Heywood interconnector were in the reverse direction. And while all this was happening there were zero flows out of Victoria into NSW despite the hugely cheaper Victorian dispatch price (remember that generators offering at negative $1,000/MWh are essentially willing to give away dollars along with their megawatts!): The puzzle about zero flows into NSW is relatively simple (for the NEM), resulting from a so-called “negative residue management constraint” (OK, that doesn’t sound simple). Despite 5-minute prices being low in Victoria, the price spike at 14:05 meant that the half hourly price in Victoria was almost certain to exceed that in NSW, so net flows northward, which are settled on half-hourly prices, would have been a losing proposition. In these circumstances, a clamp is often applied to prevent 5-minute interconnector flows which appear economic from causing half hourly “negative settlement residues” – a fancy term for financial losses on transmission between regions. As to the rest of the puzzle about increases in SA generation at the expense of Victoria, despite the spot price differential being the other way, I’m far from sure about this but a possible answer may lie in the intricacies of the dispatch algorithm’s economic objective, which would seek to maximise the total combined output from generators offering at prices of -$1,000/MWh. It’s possible that in order to do this, the algorithm found a dispatch solution which maximised transmission losses across the two Victoria – SA interconnectors, thus maximising overall generation levels! For reasons that are a bit lengthy to cover here, such a solution could also explain why the dispatch price in South Australia was set above that in Victoria. This still sounds perverse and I haven’t had the time to investigate further, so if anyone has a better explanation, I’d be happy to hear it! ——————————————- About our Guest Author Allan O’Neil has worked in Australia’s wholesale energy markets since their creation in the mid-1990’s, in trading, risk management, forecasting and analytical roles with major NEM electricity and gas retail and generation companies.

    "title": "The Network Investment Paradox",
    "date": "07-03-2019 02:23:00 PM",
    "content": "Power outages have long been a fact of life in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Particularly over the humid summer months where the air-conditioners are permanently switched on. While staying in Buenos Aires for five months in 2017, street navigation by back-lit phone, and (non-romantic) candle-lit dinners, were common events. What has caused this? Ultimately, the poles and wires and substations that make up the city distribution networks ( distribution infrastructure ) can no longer sustain demand. This has badly impacted the reliability of the network, but (as we shall see) has also impacted on retail prices. By way of contrast, Australia is a case study in how over- investment in distribution infrastructure can inflate retail prices. I call this the Network Investment Paradox: Invest too little, price rise; invest too much, same thing happens. I examine the phenomenon and ask; are the regulatory policies implemented in Australia enough to maintain the right balance of network investment going forward? 1) Understanding Under-Investment The causes of network under-investment in Buenos Aires (and Argentina more generally) are complex and interwoven with broader economic, social and regulatory trends. The distribution networks were privatised in the early 1990s with two private companies Edesur and Edenor ( the distributors ) running the distribution networks for the south and north of the city respectively. Throughout the 90s there was relative reliability and stability to the distribution infrastructure due to regular maintenance and upgrade. This changed, however, with the Argentine economic crisis of 2001/2002. The federal Government froze electricity prices, (including the regulated network component) to relieve pressure on consumers. While the distributors limped along via subsidies, inflation and repeated political interference in network cost recovery, stymied distributor access to capital and disincentivised investment in the distribution infrastructure. With retail prices frozen, and inflation rampant, consumers had no incentive to reduce their demand on the system, despite paying an ever-decreasing proportion of the cost of that electricity. The graph below from The Economist shows the effect very low electricity prices had on electricity consumption in 2015. This demand in combination with a swelling population has resulted in a network that can no longer guarantee reliable supply. The election of the Macri Government in 2015, saw a plan to improve distribution infrastructure and for utility bills to better reflect the cost of producing the utility. Combined with pressure from the International Monetary Fund to manage the deficit, in the last two years Buenos Aires has experienced massive jumps in retail prices. The most recently slated increase is for an average of 55 per cent per consumer ( noted here ). Increased retail prices have facilitated a range of network investment to improve the distribution infrastructure. See, for example, https://www.smart-energy.com/industry-sectors/smart-grid/edesur-argentina-enel/ , for improvements occurring in the broader province as well as in the city of Buenos Aires. In short, the costs of chronic under-investment will eventually be passed on to the consumer, and likely at a higher cost than would result from regular maintenance and upgrade. 2) Understanding Over-investment The ‘gold-plating’ of Australian transmission and distribution networks has been the main driver of rising retail prices over the last decade or so. The ACCC Retail Pricing Inquiry and the Australian Energy Regulator ( AER ) identified inefficient regulation of network pricing as the cause of this over-investment (see page 158 ). Previous regulatory settings meant that the AER had to accept expenditure proposals if it was satisfied that they ‘reasonably reﬂected’ efficient, prudent and realistic expenditure. This enabled distributors to submit the highest possible demand forecasts and, left the burden for the AER to show that the distributors did not meet the standard. Those forecasts, in turn, enabled distributors to invest excessively in the reliability of distribution infrastructure. The graph below demonstrates this trend by showing the increased in the ‘Regulated Asset Base’ for distributors over time (see page 159 ). Focusing on the 2014-2016 period this graph shows the increases starting to level off. This has been attributed to a range of regulatory measures including: giving the AER greater ability to assess network revenues and proposed costs; a focus on benchmarking and changes in assessing debt and rate of return; and, increased stakeholder participation in price-setting. 3) Lessons for Australia It is essential wherever distribution infrastructure is privatised that the right incentives are in place to support reasonable investment in the upgrade and maintenance of that network. If the business’s ability to make a reasonable return is stymied, that investment won’t happen. However, excessive investment will unfairly pass extra costs on to consumers. While network investment in Australia is arguably approaching a reasonable balance between over and under-investment, are there any emerging trends that should make us worry? There are two trends that are worth pondering: 3a) Embedded Networks Private electricity networks, often called ‘embedded networks’ and located in apartment buildings, shopping malls, retirement villages and caravan parks, are a growing form of electricity distribution in Australia. It is estimated that there are between 3,000 and 4,000 embedded networks in National Electricity Market jurisdictions, serving between 213,000 and 227,000 customers (see page 15 ). While the Embedded Network Operators (ENOs) are entitled to pass on the costs of the wider distribution network to their small customers, they are not permitted to charge for the costs of maintaining and upgrading that private network. See Electricity Network Service Provider – Registration Exemption Guideline, Version 6, March 2018 , p64 . While there are reforms in development intended to require ENOs to register as a class of distributor, there are no proposals currently that they will need to meet the reliability standards of distributors or to allow ENOs to charge for internal network costs. This means that there may be insufficient incentive for ENOs to invest and ensure that their networks meet reasonable reliability and security standards. Over time, this could lead to significant under-investment in the resources used to supply customers. 3b) Embedded/Distributed Energy Resources (DER) The rise of solar power in Australia has meant a significant increase in embedded or distributed generation. This is small-scale, de-centralised generation connected to the grid at a distribution (rather than transmission) level. Common instances include rooftop solar PV, battery storage, electric vehicles (EV) and EV chargers, as well as demand response initiatives. There are concerns that this might have an impact on the broader network (see page 1 ). Concerns include: overstated or understated network demand forecasts through a failure to account for behind-the-meter generation. This could affect distributor forecasts as well as those made by the market operator (AEMO); safety risks to workers, installers and the general public through emergency services and line workers or electricians not having adequate information on sites with distributed energy resources. A planned register of distributed energy resources (Guidance is expected to be released in mid-2019) may improve visibility of these assets. Editor’s Note At Global-Roam, we collaborated with the Energy Storage Council (now the Smart Energy Council) to invest considerable resource into the development of an Energy Storage Register that would operate on a beneficiary-pays basis. This process began prior to the COAG Consultation, and continued in parallel with this – and is discussed here . Given the route chosen by COAG as the result of this consultation, we suspended further investment in our proposed solution. In the case of both embedded networks and DER, regulators need to take special care to ensure that there is transparency across the broader network and incentives in place to ensure sensible investment.

    "title": "The death* of “baseload” and rise of “cycling”",
    "date": "07-03-2019 06:20:00 AM",
    "content": "* Note – “death” has not happened yet, but these numbers do show how the NEM is evolving. As frequent readers of WattClarity will recall, we’re buried in data and analysis for our extensive Generator Report Card , which is looking into 50+ different metrics covering different aspects of performance for all generators in Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM). Current ETA for the report is early April at which point the special early-bird pricing lapses. —– As part of this process, the following graphic dropped out that summed up, I believe, the scale of the transition that has already overtaken the NEM, and also gives some clue of how radically different the supply mix will look in the decades ahead. (A) The rise of cycling To help us delve into, and hopefully answer, a number of overlapping questions about technical and commercial aspects of power station performance, one of the metrics we’ve derived from original AEMO data is the number of starts for a unit (i.e. number of times the unit has increased output from 0MW to something measurable). Number of starts is also the number of full cycles they have completed – with cycles (for thermal plant in particular) affecting certain aspect of damage on high cost components (e.g. fatigue), hence affecting remnant life . An increased number of starts might be a clue into some future change in forced outage rate for the plant, for instance (though obviously there are other factors involved – such as the maintenance regime and so on). There’s much more for us to do with this discrete data, which we have down at the level of every single unit across the NEM. However I thought the following chart was worth sharing as it summed up one of the headline changes in the NEM . On the right axis, we trend the number of generation units (i.e. DUIDs) operational in the year and, only a slightly smaller number, the number of those units that cycled at least once. This should highlight, to those who are unaware, that most units do cycle at least once in a year. There are relatively rare occasions where units run continuously for longer than a year (like Stanwell unit 1 which operated continuously for 1,076 days and set a world record through to 2015 ), but that’s the exception more than the rule. On the left axis, we show the cumulative number of cycles across all units in that year. There’s a step up in CAL 2018 due in part to the influx of large-scale solar plant commissioned through the year. Obviously each solar farm cycles every day (it’s actually more than once per day – more on that in the Report Card). However that’s only part of the story – even before the influx of solar, the trend had been upwards, growing more quickly than the growth in units. To me the one thing that jumps out from this chart is that we’re entering into a world that will have an exponentially greater number of unit cycles each year than was the case when the NEM started 20 years ago…. (B) Implications of this change That’s going to have all sorts of implications to how the market and grid operate, and to what needs to happen physically to keep supply and demand balance. Here are a couple off the top of my head: (B1) Pricing patterns are already changing As noted at the end of Q2 2016 , and then updated again at the end of Q2 2017 , there has already been a significant change in the pattern of pricing we seen across the NEM. This has happened, in part (though not wholly) because of the changes illustrated in the trend above – with implications flowing through in a number of respects, including the following. We need to recognise that this shift is already happening, and not continue to think with yesterday’s paradigms (as discussed here earlier in the week) (B2) What happens to “baseload” energy users? The term “baseload” has been used by some to refer to large power stations, which are high capex and relatively low opex (per unit of production). In the NEM, these have been predominantly coal fired – plant which have already begun phasing out of operations, a trend which will continue in the coming years (with much conjecture and debate about the actual rate of closure). My understanding is that the term “baseload” was originally used on the other side of the supply/demand mix – to “loads” that share similar basic properties, in that: they are high capex and relatively low opex per unit of production, hence find it most economically efficient to run 24x7x365 with as little downtime as possible. These are the major energy users which represent a significant chunk of the total energy consumed from the NEM . There are questions being raised by a number of these large energy users (a number of whom are our clients) about the looming exit of baseload on the supply side, and the implications of that for them. I understand their concerns and we are trying to help them as we can. Already we have seen the shape of prices begin to change, and (below) I note about how orchestration is becoming more complex. There are valid concerns for these energy users, though working through to the answers is complex. (B3) Increasing need for more Demand Response Across the demand side in more general terms, it’s obvious to me that the increasing dynamic nature in the supply mix will also bring with it challenges (and opportunities) for increasing flexibility and responsiveness on the demand side – otherwise known as Demand Response in its various forms. I recently posted these thoughts here about the latest round of AEMC deliberations about Demand Response , noting that: my sense is that the rule changes proposed won’t get us where we need to go; but that there does appear to be alternative approaches that could deliver more upside, with less downside. (B4) Increasing need for balancing on the Supply Side It should go without saying that there will be a need for increasing flexibility of other assets on the supply side to balance the intermittency of wind and solar. That’s one reason (numerically) for what could be an exponential rise in the “# Unit Cycles” measure in the chart above moving forwards – i.e. we know Large Solar plant will cycle once per day, notionally (it’s actually more than that). One of the implications is that each cycle of a Solar Farm will also mean cycling at other dispatchable assets (almost certainly many more than 1 other “matched but inverse” plant). Many of these cycles won’t be full cycles (i.e. ON-OFF-ON), but they will still contribute to some aspects of plant degradation. Hence the need to track this sort of metric in order to understand how quickly we’re using up remaining life in the current plant mix, and what that means (in terms of durability) of the plant that will be built to replace them (for instance, implications for Barkers Inlet in SA). (B5) Orchestration becomes more complex It’s a bit (a lot!) of a simplification, but one of the inferences that we could try to draw from the chart above is that we’re moving from a “set and forget” world in AEMO’s operations centres and the network control rooms of our TNSPs (where those days of extreme activity were the perhaps more exception than the norm), to an environment where there are many more moving (and independent) variables. This flags that there could be increased challenges ahead – which is why we are taking so much interest in metrics like the extent each individual unit has been Off-Target over all Dispatch Intervals in the past. I posted some early thoughts on 7th January , including highlighting a number of different reasons why a generator might be significantly Off-Target. Our analysis has continued since that time and (over a few different time ranges) we have tabulated a list of the “worst performers” – i.e. the DUIDs that have most frequently been more than 100MW away from their dispatch targets (sometimes higher than target, more often lower than target). We’re double-checking the results before inclusion in the Report Card , but have already flagged some intriguing questions that we are exploring, such as: (a) Why do some particular wind farms appear as poor performers in this respect – and how does that correlate with Causer Pays Factors? (b) Why are coal units in one particular region (across multiple portfolios) worse performers than coal units in the other regions? (c) What technical characteristics are there at hydro that give rise to the results we’re seeing? (d) If a unit is small but the percentage off-target is large, though perhaps under 100MW, what’s the significance of that from a system predictability point of view? (e) Which fuel types are under- represented in the current “worst performers” list, and what are the reasons for (and possible implications of) this? (B6) Implications for hedging But the implications go further than that – into (for instance) what will be the nature of hedging required for participants in the wholesale market (and down into the retail market with a growing number of energy users if the transition proceeds down the “Left Turn” route here . After all, we have for 16 years had a Base Load Futures contract traded on the ASX and it is still the most commonly traded contracts in the suite of energy hedges (historical data for which is available in both NEMreview and ez2view ). Is this going to continue into the future, or are different (i.e. cycling-related) options going to become more dominant ( like those Dave Guiver talked about here )? —– That’s all I have time for today…",

    "title": "Some thoughts about Demand Response, in parallel with AEMC deliberations",
    "date": "05-03-2019 10:30:00 AM",
    "content": "Back on Friday 21 st December 2018, submissions closed for consideration in parallel with AEMC’s deliberations about these three Rule Change proposals relating to one method of Demand Response in the NEM . In 19 years of operations we’ve only made 1 or 2 formal submissions, so it should be no surprise that we did not make one in this case, either. We do, however, try to make it along to public forums where rule changes we’re particularly interested in are discussed – which is why I am disappointed I can’t be at the AEMC’s Public Workshop on the demand response work program in Melbourne today (Tuesday 5 th March) . Unfortunately, the demands of completing the Generator Report Card are meaning other things are not making the list, or being deferred. Our absence should not be taken for lack of interest. Indeed, following from questions from several parties who we know will be in attendance, I’ve invested some time to pen some thoughts here in the hope that they might be of use in the deliberations. I’d just caution that I’ve not had enough focused time to think these thoughts through as far as I would like, so they are a bit “rough and ready” and may well have warts. Happy if readers want to point out glitches they see – but note I won’t be surprised if you do. If you would like to speak with us about these thoughts (or about how we can assist you with Demand Response) please either: 1) give us a call on +61 7 3368 4064; or 2) if (like us this quarter) you’re working all sorts of odd hours and unable to call during the day, feel free to use this feedback form to provide us more details (and remember to include your phone number). (A) A Quick Summary of my current thinking For those not aware of how we’ve been facilitating DR for more than a decade, I previously provided this summary of our journey in service to Energy Users in relation to Demand Response thus far . We’ve been doing this for more than a decade – beginning way back nearly at the start of the NEM (back when most energy users, and their representatives, were pretty hostile to the idea of Demand Response!) Thankfully we’ve come a long way since that time to where discussions about Demand Response are now fairly commonplace … however, it wonder whether a number of these discussions (perhaps the discussions at the AEMC today?) are stuck in yesterday’s battles, when the market has moved on and the challenges we face in the years ahead look quite different. Unfortunately, from what I have read of all of the three rule change proposals, my concern is that none of them will really deliver the demand response we will need to see in the NEM in the years (and decades) ahead. In short: 1) Demand Response, as a percentage of our business, has grown over the years, and is a sizeable chunk; 2) This business will continue to grow , even if the rule changes proposed are not accepted. 3) If a formal mechanism for NegaWatts to be treated as a supply- side option in the dispatch algorithm is enacted, our business will receive another additional boost . We will help energy users make the most of that opportunity ( thanks for that, in advance! ) It will also help others whose business models are predicated on a need for NegaWatts. 4) However, I have serious reservations about whether that will actually advance us to where we need to be. 5) I’ve been wondering whether, that there could be a better way forward , that will build a more sustainable platform to last the market another 20 years into the future. This is outlined below (though have not had time to fully think this through – so it may well have holes). 6) I suspect there might be a number of different stakeholders who won’t like it , though – including: (a) Existing retailers (small and large); and (b) Those who have become emotionally wedded (including in their business models) to the idea that NegaWatts are a discrete and tangible thing, and that wholesale somehow is not linked to retail. 7) I understand the temptation will be to take the easier road for the implementation of a shallower NegaWatt mechanism – and if we (collectively) choose to go that way, we’ll benefit (as a company), as will our energy user clients. 8) However, we have this opportunity to think more broadly about this energy transition – and I, for one, would be interested in exploring that possible alternative route. For those who have time to continue, here’s some further discussion… (B) Some longer thoughts … though still a work in progress As a software business we frequently hear stories of products that don’t quite hit the mark, primarily because they fail in addressing real problems that need to be solved. In our past we’ve had our own share of failures in that respect – where the product seemed like a good idea at the time. In this energy transition there’s seems a risk that we (collectively) engage in the same sort of behaviours – building something that don’t solve real underlying problems. This challenge is particularly important with respect to institutionalized rule changes, given the costs involved in the change and the difficulty (impossibility?) in unwinding if it does not work. So let’s start by outlining what we see as the underlying problem that needs to be solved. (B1) A growing need for flexibility on the demand side It’s clear to us that there is an increasing need for increased flexibility on the demand side of the electricity sector . The AEMC Consultation Paper provides a reasonable explanation of what the underlying challenge is, and why the NEM needs a much more price-responsive demand side of the supply/demand equation in future. Coincidentally, also in December we noted this presentation by Brattle Group about the types of changes they see (and particularly the rise of intermittent renewables) warranting an evolution to what they call “Demand Response 2.0”. (B1a) Increased variability a feature of “ NEM 2.0 ” The key point for me is that the need for responsiveness and flexibility on the demand side is about way more than those few days each year of peak demand . It’s commonly noted that the increased penetration of supplies from intermittent wind and solar PV generation technologies is meaning a different requirement for the remaining generation plant left to match the shortfall between supply and demand. In the future) Back in October 2015, I posted this article examining how the ramp rate requirement would become significantly greater than had been the case historically . Already the case now) We’re part-way through that journey to the “10x world” modelled in that analysis – and our Generator Report Card 2018 will provide some assessment of how far we have already progressed in that transition. Of course, it’s not only increased range and control of ramp rate on the supply-side that will become increasingly important. Maintaining the balance between supply and demand could also be facilitated (if triggered well) by rapid changes consumption profiles from one interval to the next. This is, of course, the domain of “Demand Response”. (B1b) What is “Demand Response” “Demand Response” is a term given to a range of activities undertaken by electricity users, or people acting on their behalf, to temporarily curtail consumption from the grid in response to some form of commercial incentive. This might be done by a combination of: (a) Reducing the total consumption at that point in time; and (b) Reducing the draw on the grid by some form of onsite generation substitution. It might be possible to generate more than consumed, and so export to the grid at that point. As such, there are a broad suite of potential approaches to eliciting a change in consumption profile. Identifying and exploring a range of these approaches is one of the reasons why we prepared this explanatory information at www.DemandResponse.com.au some time ago. (B1c) Scale of the requirement Starting from the top, it’s important we understand that the desired outcome is both of the following: Outcome #1) We require additional demand response that can deliver total MW response well into the 100MWs per region (and possibly 1,000MWs in QLD, NSW and VIC) Outcome #2) Because of the stochastic nature of the growing numbers of overlapping but independent variables (e.g. variability in consumption patterns, wind harvest patterns, solar harvest patterns, network capability patterns, etc…) it seems certain that demand response will be required to operate more frequently in future than has been the case in the past – and a times that won’t fit into a simplistic definition of “peak”. Pricing patterns have changed in the NEM, and are set to change further. This analysis in 2017 and in 2016 talks about some of the changes – and here I spoke about possible implications for demand response . It’s important to understand that the behaviour we wish to incentivize is not just to curtail at times of (still relatively rare) very high prices , which is the way it’s worked in the past for our clients and others. It also includes: (a) consuming more when prices would otherwise be negative and renewable production otherwise curtailed; and (b) it means moderating consumption much more frequently when prices are driven into the $100s due to low wind and solar harvest patterns. To do this requires engaging a much broader set of energy users than has been the case in the past. But it also means correctly defining the problem as above (and my concern is that a focus singularly on NegaWatts could be an example of Villain no 5 in not focusing properly on the real problem/opportunity ). Instead, shouldn’t our objective be focused on removing real barriers to the ongoing growth of flexibility on the consumption side of the supply/demand balance? (B1d) Real barriers we have experienced, to Demand Response In parallel with the AEMC’s review of several rule change requests, and because of the underlying need to stimulate a more active demand side to keep supply/demand in balance given the increased challenges in the environment we’re driving into, I thought it would be useful to outline these real barriers to Demand Response in the NEM . (a) In our journey, we have had some success in addressing these barriers, however there is still a long way to go. (b) Below we make some suggestions as to approaches that might be (at least) considered as having the potential to deliver the increased flexibility that we’re all going to need. (B1e) Demand Response is not, however, a “magic wand” However, it is important to recognize that there seems to be a tendency of some to reach for their preferred “magic wand” to wave away the tricky challenges that are inherent this fast-moving, and even further reaching, energy transition. Even though, or perhaps especially because , we are a keen facilitator of Demand Response in the NEM, and look forward to continuing to grow that side of our business into the future (whatever the outcome of this latest round of AEMC deliberation) we are keen to note that Demand Response is also not a Magic Wand , and shouldn’t be viewed as a “get out of jail” card. We all need to understand that the prime reason any energy user connects to the grid is not to keep the lights on – but rather to use the energy embedded in the electricity supply to produce something useful to them. I have seen some positive heroic assumptions (akin to waving the magic wand ) made about how demand response might fill some gap in the supply/demand balance in some modelling ( one example of G-I-G-O ). These sorts of naive assumptions do nothing to help the energy transition succeed, and only embolden the critics who are amongst those advocating a U-turn on our energy transition. (B2) Four broad routes we could choose? The way I see things, we are approaching a crossroads in this energy transition – at which the choices we make ( including with respect to this deliberation, but well beyond this one) will have far-reaching implications for the electricity sector – and the broader economy and environment. Given that we are assisting a diverse range of clients manage the challenges (both threats and opportunities) inherent in this transition, I’ve been giving some thought to the implications of each of these choices. Possible Route 1) U-turn not possible? Firstly, let’s start with the choice that some would seem to be seeking to make – to turn this energy transition around, and make our way back to some “glory days” of the past where (as their recollections would have it) the energy sector was much more to their liking. Amongst these are two types: Type 1 of U-Tuners) There are those Villain no3 who might be saying things like: “The sky will fall in!” if we continue with the energy transition . Some would like to wind the transition back only a few years, back to a point where the incremental unit cost* of wind and solar were such that it was not a rational choice, in the absence of external subsidy: * As an aside, frequent readers might remember my recent request that we all start thinking/talking more about VALUE, rather than COST , following this shift. Type 2 of U-Turners) Others would like to wind the clock back more than 20+ years, before the start of the market – though I have previously noted how those claims are based on some pretty strange recollections , at least in terms of the wholesale market . It seems clear to me that, for a combination of reasons, we can’t go back to the past . U-turn not permitted. Possible Route 2) Hazards straight ahead? There are a sizeable number (it seems) who appear blissfully unaware, and contented to continue to plough on forward down the path we have been proceeding. Amongst these are those Villain no3 who might be saying things like: “The problems are already solved – see such-and-such report proved it could all be done.” However, we have hit some potholes in this journey already, and the signs appear that there’s some significant hazards lying straight ahead in our energy transition, and we are a high risk of derailing, unless we take some precautionary action. I noted this back in July 2017 , and would reiterate the warning here of “Hazards Ahead”! The ESB, in their 2018 Health of the NEM report , said pretty much the same thing – with the distinct red/orange shade of their report ringing alarm bells: … so we can’t keep doing what we’ve been doing to date and need to change course, and many realize this…. Possible Route 3) Turn right into “NegaWatt Land” Each of these rule changes that are under consideration at the AEMC essentially encompass a change in course that would incorporate two linked developments: (a) The institutionalization, via the rules, of a NegaWatt as an intangible supply -side response; coupled with (b) An increase in opacity of the demand side – through the institutionalization, via the rules, of an unmeasurable “what would otherwise have been” demand shape. These two changes might be worth the costs and risks that would be incurred through, and introduced by, the change. It’s the AEMC’s job to assess the cost/benefit trade-off. If such a method is implemented, our revenues will increase – and we’ll help a number of energy users make money via the method (so happy days for us – though not without reservations…). #3a) Start with the end in mind… As noted above, the real problem is how to assist the market in delivering additional 1,000MWs of consumption (NEM-wide) that triggers more frequently than has been the case in the past. Coupled with the fact that we want to extend this flexibility down to loads smaller than 1MW in size means that we’re talking about engaging with a large number of sites (potentially 10,000s) . Any rule change (or other) method we produce through this AEMC process should start with this objective clearly in mind as the end goal. The AEMC documentation also talks about the desire to have greater transparency about the process – but (in my view) this is a secondary requirement to the overall delivery of responsive consumption. #3b) The proposals revolve around a “Negawatt” commodity These proposals are based on some form of methodology for the creation of a (hypothetical) “what would have otherwise been” consumption level. This is generally called a Baseline – as noted here in the snapshot from the Rule Change proposal assessed in the 2015 round of deliberations : I note that the rule change proposals submitted in 2018 were quite scant on details for how the specific methodology by which these baselines would be developed (e.g how, by whom, when, etc) – but it is important to keep in mind that whatever method would need to be workable for 1,000s or 10,000s of sites, perhaps many below 1MW individually . For a Baseline method to work, we effectively need to think of three different trended variables/commodities: Variable #1 = the intangible (unmeasurable) “what might have otherwise been” Baseline , which represents the Demand Side of the supply/demand balance in dispatch. Variable #2 = the intangible (unmeasurable) “what they said they curtailed” Negawatt reduction , which acts as an effective supply-side contribution in the supply/demand balance. Variable #3 = the measurable “what actually happened” consumption level , which would play a much lesser role in the dispatch process and is effectively relegated to the difference between Variable 1 and Variable 2, both of which can’t be measured. Acknowledging the inherent impossibility of knowing “what would have otherwise been” (though it is a common analytical challenge ) let’s move beyond the basics to understand how the widespread adoption of baselines could open up cans of worms in a number of ways. #3c) Baselines, and cans of worms I noted above that it’s my view that transparency should be a consideration secondary to securing the responsiveness of the electricity consumption – however let’s start by acknowledging that the introduction of two artificial (and unmeasurable) commodities for 1,000s (or perhaps 10,000s )of sites would hardly seem to be moving the NEM in the direction towards greater transparency. Concern #1) Introduction of baselines will lead to “gaming the baseline” behaviour In our own demand response journey , we have had energy users tell us directly that they have used our own software to “game the baseline” methodology established for them by their retailers. Understandably, they did not use those exact words: (a) Whilst this has put us in a somewhat uncomfortable position (i.e. knowing that a particularly designed scheme is having an effect inverse to its intent), we also appreciate that it is a commercially rational outcome , given the incentives that are in place. (b) At least in the current case, retailers can respond relatively rapidly (if they perceive that there are groups of energy users engaging in such behaviour) to amend the programs they have in place, or limit their scope. I would not be surprised if this is one of the reasons for the anecdotal evidence reported elsewhere that “my retailer does not call on my Demand Response much anymore” (i.e. this method here ). We’ve long known of the “spark spread” being the arbitrage across the gas-to-power bridge, and more recently have been thinking more of the “time spread” inherent in any value proposition for storage. The introduction of any mechanism that creates a NegaWatt commodity as a defacto supply-side offer will inevitably give rise to a “NegaWatt spread” , being the difference between: a fixed retail price for “What would have otherwise been” Consumption; and a dynamic, and at times much higher , wholesale price for NegaWatt curtailment as a Supply-Side option. As we have been told already that energy users already use our software, on occasions, to optimize this, it seems blindingly obvious that we’re going to have more clients doing the same thing when the process is institutionalized in a rule change. Now I’m sure that rules could be written to reduce the incentive for the energy user to game the baseline, essentially by increasing the increased cost of inflating it on the retail market (e.g. baseline shall be average of last 20 days of consumption, etc…), I wonder whether tying the energy user in a straight-jacket in this way is counter to the stated objective of incentivising them to be more responsive ? That’s one of the reasons we have serious reservations: (a) On the upside, there is the possibility that formalization will bring with it a much more robust policing and enforcement capability; however (b) History tells us that our business will grow further, with more sites using our software to do the same thing in this case (or at least to attempt to do so) – even though it will feel like a pyrrhic success for us. Concern #2) Additional management costs will be significant Remember that the reason for such a rule change deliberation is because we need to engender 1,000s or 10,000s of additional sites to provide responsiveness of demand, triggered by spot prices. The way it seems to me, this will lead to an escalation of costs across the industry – with a few areas highlighted. 2a) Costs at the AEMO Naturally, the parties with vested interest in the NegaWatt, and hence the baseline, (i.e. energy user and aggregator) should not be the ones who ultimately define the baseline – that would just be inviting trouble. We presume it would be the AEMO who would be tasked (or at least heavily involved) with calculating the baselines in some form. This won’t be a trivial amount of work, and would seem to require a new team of people and real-time information systems accessing site meter data for energy users, and possibly other data sets as well. 2b) Costs at the AER Given the near certainty that some will try to game the baseline, and the inherent complexities in accounting for two commodities which can’t actually be measured (one on each side of the supply/demand mix), I presume that the AER would need to further beef up its monitoring and enforcement capabilities (people and tools, including more people to visit energy user sites and familiar with process operations for a range of energy users) to review the operations of all of these sites. Apart from the costs involved in the AER, it also seems certain that the lawyers involved in NEM rules and regulations will see an uptick in their business as a result. 2c) Costs at the MDAs Through the creation process, the Meter Data Agent will effectively need to create a time-series record of Variable #1 and Variable #2. Given that the objective is to elicit demand response across many sites, and that there will be a need for a number of parties to access the “what would otherwise have been” demand trace for various reasons, it would seem to me that the presumption must be that the mechanism is put in place for Variable #1 and Variable #2 traces be created for all energy users (or at least all above a certain size, if there is some threshold set for the minimum size NegaWatt response). If this was to be the case, then reason would dictate the change be made at the same time as 5-minute settlement is implemented (given the sunk costs already committed to the change in metering data at that time) – however we need to be aware that we’d be talking 3 x the data volume, which won’t be a trivial cost. 2c) More general data handling costs, and confusions In our own experience, we have seen the NEM become an increasingly complex place – moving from a position where (historically) Scheduled Demand was the only real measure of consumption in the NEM. Now we have Operational Demand, Native Demand and Native Consumption on top of that historical basis – which does make one more prone to error in understanding and decision making. So much so, we put this long explanatory article together to help our readers. Adding in a “what might have otherwise been” demand trace for a large number of sites seems a recipe for additional confusion. These increased costs of data handling would presumably make their way through to energy users in their final bills. Concern #3) Risk of higher retail prices The underlying argument I have heard numerous times over the years is that the energy users is paid some share of the amount the Demand Response Aggregator is paid for dispatching the NegaWatts as a supply-side option in the price setting process. Hence, the argument goes: (a) That particular energy user gets paid a revenue stream (as a defacto peaking generator on the supply-side); whilst (b) All energy users benefit as a result of these other supply-side options keeping the lid on wholesale pricing. Hence, so the argument goes, it’s win-win for all energy users – with the losers being those big bad generators who have been ripping us off in any case. Unfortunately, implicit in this storyboard seems to be an assumption that the cost of retail contracts won’t shift as a result . Of course, it would be nice to think of these retailers as the big bad ones we all like to wave our big sticks at – however the reality is that the costs will be shared across all retailers, including the smaller ones (down to new entrants who are receiving more favourable media coverage and wear the black tee shirts, and might even be the ones we like to like) In this earlier article on WattClarity from 8 th October 2018 , Mike Williams explains that the “Plain Vanilla” retail contract incorporates a general structure as follows: Retail energy price = Wholesale energy price + Administration costs + Risk premium (volume, load profile and credit risks) + Retailer margin The general structure of retail pricing is not a secret – I can remember it being discussed and presented on by a range of retailers and retail brokers for as far back as 10-15 years ago. It was back in October 2009 when I posted this article , for instance. However, despite it being fairly widely understood that retailers add a risk premium onto their wholesale hedging cost to determine the retail contract prices they offer, proposals for the introduction of market-wide NegaWatt buyback mechanisms seem to always assume that the retail price the retailer offers to the energy user won’t change. Personally, I can’t see why this would be the case – or why, at least, the retailer would not seek to charge a higher risk premium, and a higher administration costs, if competitive pressures allow. Remember that retailers are the ones who have had experience with their own NegaWatt programs in the past, including the observations that: (a) the commercial structures incentivize some energy users to try to increase their consumption at times when they think the price might be high and their NegaWatts dispatched (which will mean that at least for some retailers they will be more “short” their own generation capacity when the price is high – after all, they can’t all be “long” at the same time); and (b) oftentimes, price spikes forecast in predispatch will evaporate by the time they reach reality. Hence it is possible that retailers might conclude that the “what would have otherwise been” energy consumption that they will be purchasing from AEMO on the wholesale market will, on average, increase in cost. This would be a cost that they would try to recover through the retail prices they offer. The complication with an AEMO-administered market-wide program is that the retailer might not be able to know which energy user is supplying NegaWatts at any given point in time (e.g. if their identity is cloaked through some form of Demand Response Aggregator). Hence the risk is there that the retailer might conclude that they have to assume that all their customers are possibly participating. Now it might be the case that competitive pressures mean that retailers are unable to hike their risk premium, in which case they will have to absorb the cost that this increased risk amounts to. However, that seems a big assumption to make – given the potential impacts might flow through to all retail rates. Now it might be that this increase in cost paid for all MWh consumed is outweighed by the revenue earned by dispatch of some NegaWatts at different points in time. Let me reiterate that we’re ready to serve, should such a change be implemented. We have already identified several ways that our business will gain another step-change of growth if it happens. Our plans were refined back in 2015-16, when AEMC last looked at the introduction of a Negawatt buy-back mechanism . For energy users who want to know more, they can call us on (07) 3368 4064 – if (or when) the rule change is passed. Before we get to that, however, the commencement of deliberation on the rule change is the point at which we can (and should) consider what the real objective is, and whether the path this would set us towards would assist us down the path of getting us to our intended (indeed, required ) end destination. Perhaps inadvertently, Craig Memery highlighted what jumped out at me as a key point in the following tweet during some dialogue a few weeks ago now: Let’s leave aside the capacity payment line (not sure I would have said that we need one, as I have certainly noted before that they are fraught with their own problems ). I’m also not sure that it’s the main barrier to DR (as I had noted these two greater barriers , based on our own experience), however it is a shortcoming in the NEM that there is (mostly) generation-only dispatch currently. However, let’s be clear – the introduction of a NegaWatt commodity as a supply- side option in the dispatch process will (in my view) actually make that problem worse , not better . That’s because the AEMO will treat the NegaWatt as a defacto supply- side offer, and still be relied upon to assume the underlying demand shape for each region as an input into the NEMDE process. (I assume) it will still be the AEMO who estimates the Scheduled Demand for just as many sites that needs to be met by dispatchable supply, which so sets the price. What will change is that the AEMO will (in this new world) need to also make assumptions for that “what would otherwise be” future demand shape at numerous sites across the NEM offering (i.e. not yet dispatched in the NEMDE run) NegaWatt supply. This assumed demand would thereafter never be able to be reconciled with any metered quantity (except in the case where you also add in an assumed, but unmeasurable, NegaWatt response), which does not seem a great way for progressively improving the refinement of demand forecasts over time. I don’t understand how such an approach adds to market transparency – especially when it needs to be scaled up to thousands of smaller sites to meet our Demand Response needs in the years and decades ahead? (a) If the assumption is that this is all going to remain some form of rounding error in size, then what’s the point in implementing a mechanism? (b) If the assumption is that this method will work, then we’ll be accepting that auditability of a range of different measures will become so much more difficult (even practically impossible on occasions?) as the measured numbers won’t ever actually add up. It seems to me that, at the very least, there are significant hazards ahead if turning right into NegaWatt Land. Possible Route 4) Turn left towards a genuine 2-sided market There does seem to be an alternative, however – though let me be clear that this is also not a panacea ( not a magic wand ). There is already a category of participation that is currently within the rules (no changes required there) and which has begun to see what will become a rapid growth in involvement in recent times. That is, of course, the category of Scheduled Loads. It used to be the case that it was a valid argument that it was too complicated for most energy users to be Scheduled Loads in the NEM. Route 4a – Scheduled Loads as the final destination However, a range of more recent technology enhancements (including the rapid drop in cost of battery storage, and the rise of automated and semi-automated bidding systems) suggests to me that the time is ripe to think strategically about how we might help to use this inflection point to significantly grow the volume of MW operating as Scheduled Load in the NEM. I will expect that some of those who are particularly stuck on the introduction of NegaWatts into the NEM will plead about the Scheduled Load category being somehow more complicated than how a NegaWatt Supplier category would operate. However, I would suggest we clearly and dispassionately think this through, as I wonder whether this would just be another case of “socializing costs whilst privatizing benefits” for some of the organisations in that boat? If a portion of an energy user’s load could operate successfully as a supplier of NegaWatts bid continuously into the market and dispatched as required, why could it not just as successfully be a Scheduled Load (and without also bringing along all of the deficiencies that NegaWatts would bring)? Route 4b – Spot pass-through as an interim point on the journey A stepping stone in this journey, would be to help energy users understand the nexus between the (very dynamic) wholesale price that’s accessible to them and the (quite static, for the most part) retail price they have used to be obsessing about. I see that some interim period of spot exposure for real consumption (in some form), would be one way of bridging that gap. We have, as noted before , been working with energy users who operate in this manner for a number of years. As time has progressed, we’ve seen these energy users become quite sophisticated in their operations. It might be that the next step, for them, could be to become a Scheduled Load. For other energy users further down the learning curve, here are a few suggestions that we’d like to have had more time to think through: Possible Improvement #1) Benchmark cost in retail bills Much has been written elsewhere of the current Federal Government’s initiative of implementing a Benchmark Retail Price. Implementation of something like that was a recommendation in the ACCC’s 2018 review of the electricity sector (as was also, we note, the implementation of some methods to facilitate more demand response in the NEM). From the thinking I’ve managed to do thus far, I see that there’s an overlap between the two – in that it might be possible to implement a change that might be able to go some way of achieving both. What I have been thinking through is the possible merits of a mandatory requirement for all retailers to include on all retail electricity bills a simple numerical comparison for that particular customer that noted what their energy component of their bill would have been for that particular period had they purchased their electricity at spot prices. Delivering this would help to achieve a number of things: 1) Firstly, it would provide the start of a real, objective means for comparing their current offer, without requiring the AER (or anyone else) to manufacture some form of Default Retail Offer (with all the challenges that entails). (a) Spot Prices are what they are – openly published, objective and well scrutinized after 20 years – surely we could (and should) use them as the benchmark? (b) Such an approach would take explicit acknowledgement that a cost of supplying each energy user is unique, with a large share of the cost linked to their actual profile of energy use. 2) An additional benefit of this approach is that it would help to make energy users aware that there is a wholesale spot market, and that: (a) There is an option available for them to purchase on the spot is an option for them through various means; and (b) Even if they did not choose that option, it would help them understand that their time-based profile of consumption is a big determinant of the cost they pay in the retail market. 3) By comparison, the energy user will then also be made aware of the real services that the retailer provides them (e.g. insurance/hedging, and cash flow management) and the cost they are paying for these services. (a) This will lead to a real benefit in helping the energy user decide if they value these retail services. (b) In many cases I would expect that the energy user will decide that they value the retailer’s services and hence remain on their current arrangements. However, I would expect, over time, a growing number of energy users to more actively explore purchase at wholesale rates. Furthermore, it’s possible (though this would need to be checked) that this might be lined up with the transition to 5-minute settlement starting 1 st July 2021 to reduce the implementation costs and risks in the transition. This might help to defray some of the cost (and the risk) of another change to retailer billing systems. Possible Improvement #2) Enhance Energy-Made-Easy The second step in the process would be the enhancement of the Government-operated (via the AER) Energy Made Easy electricity offer comparison service. This could be done through three separate, but related enhancements: Improvement #2a) Benchmarking With the benefit of the clear separation of the “Energy” component of the retail electricity bill into its two separate components, it would make it much easier for the Energy Made Easy site to provide real benchmarking of costs on a more comparable basis: Component #1 = Wholesale Spot Cost, which would be (obviously) very dependent on the timing of consumption data, but which would be much more easily comparable with it being separately itemized. Component #2 = Retailers Service and Margin, which would be less dependent (though not wholly independent) on the particular load shape of the client, and hence much more comparable. As such, enabling the user to enter their data for a real historical bill on Energy Made Easy to receive real feedback on comparable costs for each component Note – if it was not possible, or desired, for Energy Made Easy to be evolved to provide this service, it seems likely that a third-party service provider might develop a service to provide this (it might be something we would consider, for instance) . Improvement #2b) Calculation service for “my spot cost” In parallel with the above, it would be possible to create an online service for energy users to (through submission of several data points to authenticate their rights to the account – such as Address and NMI) access a calculation of what the wholesale cost would have been over some historical time range. We have sometimes done this on a bespoke basis for energy user who have asked us, and I imagine there are other service providers (like Retail Brokers) who have provided a similar service. When done manually it is a time-consuming, and hence relatively expensive exercise – however it would be possible to automate and deliver a much more cost-effective (and timely) service to energy users. Options for where this service might live include Energy Made Easy, on the particular MDA site, or on some third party site (again, it might be an option we could provide – as would a number of others) . Improvement #2c) Comparison of “Spot Management” as an option As a separate enhancement to Energy Made Easy, it should be enhanced to provide explicit comparison of offers made by retailers to energy users for management and administration of spot price pass-through arrangements. It doesn’t seem right that it should be mandatory for energy retailers to provide offers for that particular way to serve -however it does seem useful to mandate that energy retailers indicate their willingness (or otherwise) to serve in that way, and what their form of charge would be. Other Possible Improvements … Note that there had been other ideas rattling around in my head as possibilities. However these escape me this morning, unfortunately…. (if they come back to me at some point, and we’ve delivered the Generator Report Card to our clients, I will add them into a future post). (C) Wrapping up The NEM is going to need a load more Demand Response in future given the significantly different supply mix we will be working with, and the changes to the natural environment as the climate continues changing. We’ve been a keen supporter of Demand Response over more than 10 years and look forward to this continuing. If the AEMC makes a rule change that creates a NegaWatt as a discrete, but intangible, supply-side addition to the supply/demand mix, we will be doing what we can to help our energy user clients make the most of these opportunities. Our prior experiences in working with energy users (including with the retailer’s own NegaWatt programs) has helped us identify opportunities there. However we have significant reservations about the warts that such a change would make – and wonder if there are not better approaches that would help to deliver a two-sided market with more (not less) transparency? If the AEMC wanted to explore this alternative route, we would be happy to be involved (albeit being severely time constrained at present). Finally, let me apologize for this being quite long and rambling. To paraphrase what Mark Twain is sometimes quoted as saying “if I had more time, this article would be much shorter”.",

Back then I noted how some latch onto “baseload” as the magic cure-all (give me a dollar for every mention of that in the upcoming election campaign – particularly “ fair dinkum baseload” – and we’d have enough cash for a very extravagant Christmas party this year), but there’s also a similar tendency for others to think “battery storage” is a cure-all (a dollar for mentions there and I’d be richer than Elon Musk).

As time permits in future, I hope to list specific examples that I see in here… (B) Remembering the purpose of an Energy User For now, I’d like to just reiterate that the prime objective of the Energy User in the electricity grid is not to “keep the lights on”, but rather to focus on the result of whatever useful work they want the electricity to do in the first place.

    "date": "05-03-2019 10:25:00 AM",
    "content": "It’s been apparent to me for some time that this trip-wire is growing in significance as a Villain that’s working to ensure that this energy transition is taking a much rockier path than should otherwise be the case. One of the Villains in the evolving train-wreck has been (in my view) not focusing on the real problems – we called this Villain no 5 . With the current AEMC-sponsored deliberations about ways to encourage more demand response into the market , it seems we run the risk of becoming hijacked by a different version of this Villain – becoming obsessed about NegaWatts (as a supply-side option in central dispatch) when the real objective is facilitation of significantly more Demand Response . My sense is that a percentage of our readers will be thinking “but they’re the same, aren’t they?” and (my sense is that) therein is the root of the problem…. (A) A quick refresher on Demand Response If you’re also asking that question, you’re not alone. That’s part of the reason that we put together this site as an explanation a couple years ago , and have been adding to it (as time permits) since that time. In a nutshell, “Demand Response” is a term that refers to a fairly broad range of approaches that can be taken to encourage greater flexibility of the timing of electricity consumption by energy users in response to some form of commercial incentive. That’s not to get confused with “Energy Efficiency”, which is about permanent reductions in energy use for the same unit of value received for the energy use. In the NEM to date there have been a number of methods whereby Demand Response has been growing since NEM start, and we have been involved in helping some of these to grow significantly . (B) NegaWatts, as a supply-side option The explicit dispatch of “NegaWatts” (be that by a retailer, or via some centralised process – as the AEMC considered in 2015 , and is now considering again in 2019 ) is only one subset of a much broader range of measures that fit under the Demand Response umbrella. If the overall objective is to encourage the demand side of the supply/demand balance to be more active and responsive in the energy balance process, then prematurely narrowing in on only one possible approach to achieving this objective seems to carry the risk of a sub-optimal outcome. Doesn’t it?",

For now, I just want to dig into two separate/related questions posed (one by me in yesterday’s article , and one by Dylan McConnell ) – both of which relate to reaction to the negative dispatch prices in the 14:30 trading period , and which are both summed up in this exchange on Twitter : For some initial context, here’s a line-up of Region Prices for the trading period ending 14:30 on Friday 1st March – via Time-Travel in ez2view : The dispatch price spiked at 14:05 and then dropped through the floor at 14:15 (remaining there for the next 4 dispatch intervals). This still delivered a significant trading price for VIC and SA, though it was negative in TAS. 1) Taking a brief look at what happened with 5 x Power Stations We’ll briefly look at the 5 x Power Stations referenced in the tweet above (I mentioned Karadoc SF and Gannawarra SF, whilst Dylan mentioned Loy Yang A, Loy Yang B and Yallourn stations): (A) Karadoc Solar Farm Here’s another view compiled from a couple widgets inside of ez2view with “now” of Time-Travel set to the 14:20 dispatch interval so we can see a bit of context: The ability to (today) access bid data for yesterday provides confirmation that Karadoc SF ramping down to 0MW was just the participant following a dispatch target to do so, given that it’s energy was offered at a more expensive price to the –$999.18/MWh dispatch price at 14:15. A totally understandable approach – one example of how a Semi-Scheduled solar farm might limit their exposure to low negative prices without being too active in the market. However it should be noted that this passive approach represented a lost revenue opportunity of approximately $14,500 just in 20 minutes (i.e. 84MW x 20 min x $824.43/MWh for the trading price)! (B) Gannawarra Solar Farm Here’s the analogous view for Gannawarra Solar Farm, without so many annotations: Again in this case, the plant had volume offered above the dispatch price, so it is no surprise that they were dispatched down to 0MW via the Semi-Dispatch Cap. Like Karadoc, however, this also represented a lost revenue opportunity ($12,360 approx) given the trading price still ended up at $824.43/MWh (C) Loy Yang A Power Station Loy Yang A was on the bottom of Dylan’s chart, and shows a drop in output that seems to be in this 14:30 trading period, so we take a quick look here with “now” in Time Travel focused on 14:25: The bid structure here is busier than for a Semi-Scheduled plant, and it was managed more actively than the two solar farms (being fully Scheduled, that’s almost guaranteed). However the underlying story is similar: (i) In this case, all volume offered down at –$1,000/MWh (ii) Hence not dispatched down as much (and only from 14:20 at dispatch price of –$1,000/MWh because of all the other capacity also “parked” at the Market Price Floor in the bids). (iii) Hence they minimised their risk of “lost revenue opportunity” in trading periods like this one. (D) Loy Yang B Power Station Next up the list was Loy Yang B with the story is similar – though also unique in its own way: In this case, Loy Yang B was facing a “lost revenue opportunity” much larger than those actually incurred above by Karadoc SF and Gannawarra SF – because it had about half of its volume not all the way down at –$1,000/MWh (but instead at –$999.18/MWh : no time to investigate why ). Given that this was where the price landed for 14:15 and the 2 units each set the price (that’s a “Simple” case of Price Setter in Category 2 here ), I’d be guessing* the traders were concerned they would “lose” 415MW of output for 14:20, 14:25 and 14:30 – with the trading price guaranteed to be at least +$826/MWh * Note that the rebid reason, which you can see in the image above, references the price achieved, but does not explicitly talk about motivation. That’s not unusual (and, as noted before, guessing at motivations is a core pass-time for NEM analysts ). In order to minimise the lost revenue opportunity, then, they shifted their volume down to –$1,000/MWh, thereby saving themselves “lost revenue” that might have been up to $85,700! A case study in active management. (E) Yallourn Power Station Finally we look at Yallourn and see that they had all 4 x units running with volumed offered down at –$1,000/MWh. These were dispatched down as a result of the dispatch price hitting the Market Price Floor for 3 x dispatch intervals. In this case, we see the operator had rebid a few times through the day – but this appears to be for plant related reasons and not related to the volatility through the day. 2) Difference between the conclusions today and inferences yesterday. As I’ve noted before, the NEM is a complicated beast. In this case it seemed that both Dylan and I saw an incomplete data set on Friday and our “Subconscious Inference Engines”started down the wrong paths. 1) For me, buried in the detailed analysis of all NEM power stations across up to 20 years of history (and with one particular focus being understanding patterns in units being “Off-Target” ) I saw the reduction to 0MW and immediately jumped to “trip”. A trap I’ll try not to fall into next time! 2) For Dylan, who appears integrally involved in the “#coalfail” publicity campaign, it seems a drop in output at some coal-fired stations might have automatically started the warning bells about something going awry there. Alas in both cases what we see above is much more “normal”. In the case of the reactions at Karadoc SF, Gannawarra SF, Loy Yang A, Loy Yang B and Yallourn, the reductions in output at all 5 stations appear nothing more than what each generator’s stated intentions (via their bid profiles) would suggest . Now we just have to wait for Allan to fill in the broader picture of what happened on Friday with his post next week (and I really have to try to avoid these interesting distractions and get back to the Generator Report Card 2018 )…",

    "content": "Officially it’s the first day of autumn, but I don’t think the overheated residents of Victoria or South Australia would be thinking it brought with it a cool change. This was forecast earlier in the week, as noted here on Wednesday . Of course forecasts don’t always match reality – particularly price forecasts: (a) which incorporate the effect of human behaviour embodied in trader’s decisions in terms of how to price their production; along with (b) a high level of complexity about how prices are actually determined . As it turned out, there were plenty of price spikes through the afternoon (an opportunity for reducing average cost of energy for Amber’s residential demand response customers , plus ours at the C&I level + others with different arrangements in place) – which is ongoing as I write this quick article . (A) Prices through the 14:30 trading period The price first spiked at 14:05 today , as shown in this snapshot from NEMwatch v10 entry-level dashboard : That price subsided into a period of negative price activity for the rest of the 14:30 trading period, as shown with the blue prices in the 14:15 dispatch interval. There was a bit of a lull, then, until 15:25 when prices spiked again and remained more consistently high. (B) Quick observations of operational patterns Don’t have time to post much more today, but just wanted to flag this snapshot from ez2view (higher-end dashboard) which shows two interesting points in the 15:40 dispatch interval: The output data shown is “InitialMW” snapshots from 15:35 (for the 15:40 dispatch interval) and reveal a few things: 1) Unlike the case on 25th January , where it was one of the significant contributing factors in the Load Shedding, we see all 10 x brown coal units in Victoria producing well; 2) Most gas/liquid peakers are running, but some are not (e.g. Jeeralang A); 3) We see wind production quite low across both VIC and SA ( on Wednesday I noted how the forecast seemed to be dropping away ); 4) In contrast the solar farms producing up towards their maximum capacity: As a separate note which I might dig into later, I notice the simultaneous trip at both both Gannawarra SF and Karadoc SF in the 14:20 dispatch interval (i.e. InitialMW snapshot taken at 14:15, which also happens to be the first dispatch interval where the dispatch price dropped below zero). I wonder if this was related to some strange bank of cloud cover, or a network issue, or this type of challenge , or something else I’ve not thought of? 5) I’ve also highlighted the 4 operational batteries (i.e. the Registered ones) in VIC and SA and have made a mental note to drill in further at a later date (perhaps when finished the work on the Generator Report Card 2018 ) as it surprised me that none of them seemed* to respond to the initial half hour of high prices in the 14:30 trading period – though the trading price did land down around only $1,000/MWh with the negative dispatch prices. * Might have overlooked that in the time constraints today. ————– One more interesting event to dig into further, when more time allows …",

    "title": "Lessons Learnt from Amber’s first summer of Spot Exposure in the NEM",
    "date": "01-03-2019 09:40:00 AM",
    "content": "How can we make sure everyday consumers benefit from the radical changes that are taking place in our electricity grid? That was the fundamental question we started with when we founded Amber Electric . Increasing renewable penetration is coincident with increased intra-day volatility in market prices, and increased volumes of distributed energy assets is enabling customers to participate more in the market. Combining these 2 factors together creates an opportunity for households to participate more in the electricity market , and to actually benefit from the transformation occurring. This is what Amber set out to enable. Working with licensed retailer Energy Locals , we’ve brought to market an electricity plan that passes through wholesale electricity prices directly to everyday households, both for electricity consumed from the grid and for electricity exported. Within this relationship, Energy Locals are focused on providing the traditional retailing functions for customers (including billing and concessions), while Amber is focusing on maximising the customer benefit from wholesale prices. This benefit for customers comes through by shifting their usage to cheaper wholesale electricity times . And for those customers with DERs, they can also benefit by providing power to the grid during peak events – and earn high wholesale rates for doing so. Amber operates on just a flat $10 a month margin, with all other components passed through at cost – this means Amber’s interests are aligned to customers’, since there’s no profit from selling more electricity. Amber launched in NSW (Ausgrid distribution area) in August 2018, and expanded to SA in November. This means the 2018/19 summer period has been our first chance to see how a residential wholesale product works in the market, and the summer certainly threw out some challenges and opportunities for us. Lesson 1: Wholesale prices enable customers to save (most of the time) The first lesson, probably familiar to readers of WattClarity , is how consistently wholesale prices enable customers to save compared to traditional fixed prices. This might be even more true for residential customers than businesses (who have had access to wholesale prices for years) as customers use a proportionally higher load during weekends, when wholesale prices are consistently cheap. We definitely see different load profiles by different customer types, with customers who use large but controlled amounts of electricity typically seeing the cheapest rates (e.g. customers with pools or electric vehicles). Additionally, customers who use more power earlier during the day, or on weekends, tend to see better prices than those who consistently use the most from 6-9pm on weekdays. An endorsement of the savings from one of our early customers Overall, we consistently see usage prices for customers in NSW equal to the best retail products on the market, and in SA ~20% lower than the best prices on the market. This is a substantial savings for those customers who are comfortable with a higher level of volatility. One this point, it leads clearly to the 2nd lesson Lesson 2: SA is a very different market than NSW In NSW wholesale prices has given customers access to rates equal to the best in the retail market, and over summer these prices stayed pretty stable. In SA the savings from moving to wholesale prices are significantly larger, but that comes with increased volatility. For SA this summer, this volatility essentially came down to 1 event over the summer – the price spikes of January 24th , when the market stayed at the price cap for 5 hours in a row. This presented the biggest test of the Amber model that we’d yet seen. In the morning, our system notified Amber customers about the potential price spike , although we were a little sceptical as we’d seen a number of false alarms over the summer. Based on this notification, we did see about 50% of Amber customers engage in some sort of demand response. Anecdotally this ranged from raising the temperature set-point on their air-conditioner by a 3 degrees, through to choosing to spend it with friends/family instead of at home. The upside of this event was for solar customers, most of whom actually profited overall from the spike (by exporting solar and receiving high wholesale rates). Our highest earner received almost $150 from their solar in the window, which is pretty incredible. Solar Exports and Earnings from our most important customers in SA – my parents On the flip side, events like this really make the trade-offs of the wholesale pricing model particularly acute: if you were able to reduce your usage during this 5 hour window you enjoyed low wholesale prices for the month (and potentially a nice bonus if you exported during the period). However, many of those customers who weren’t able to reduce usage reached our monthly average price cap (set to 40c/kWh in SA) . This could wipe out 2-3 months worth of accumulated savings from wholesale prices, so it’s a significant trade-off. Lesson 3: Solar is a surprisingly effective hedge One lesson that we ourselves hadn’t fully appreciated was how effectively rooftop solar works to provide a price hedge in the Australian market. Typically over summer we see the highest prices during times when solar is still generating strongly, and so our customers with rooftop solar saw significantly less volatility in their prices than those without rooftop solar. We expected customers with batteries to show this behaviour (since they’ve essentially bought a physical hedge on the market), but the fact that solar-only customers saw such savings was an unexpected bonus. It really raises the question about how much the 20% households in Australia who have rooftop solar are currently “over-hedged” by traditional retail models, given this correlation. Lesson 4: Manual demand response needs more engagement One area we don’t think we did as well during the summer (especially on January 24th) was keep our customers more informed about what was happening in the market. We saw a significant increase in demand during the last hour of the price spike, which potentially could have been avoided (and thus saved our customers money) if we’d been keeping people informed in real-time about what was happening. It also raises the question about when to let people know about the spike happening. Ideally you’d give people plenty of warning so that they can best prepare, however this comes with the downside that you’re more likely to produce false-positives in this situation, which overseas experience suggests reduces the effectiveness of the demand response. Either way there seems to be no downside to proactively engaging customers more during spikes (especially ones of extended duration). Lesson 5: Automated demand response needs to be the model for the future Ultimately the lesson for us from the summer is that to deliver all the benefits of wholesale pricing, we need to make it extremely easy for customers to be able to automatically respond to changes in prices. This includes existing appliances in peoples’ homes like electric hotwater systems, pool pumps, and airconditioners, as well us newer technologies such as home batteries and electric cars. In our view, this is the necessary next step to enabling customers to participate more in our energy market, and benefit from the transformations that are happening. The good news is that we so far have an amazing group of engaged customers who want our help with this, and so that’s our challenge to prepare for the next summer! ————- About our Guest Author Chris Thompson is CEO and Co-Founder of Amber Electric, behind the only product delivering electricity to Australian households at true wholesale prices.

    "title": "A (preliminary) Intermediate Guide to How Prices are Set in the NEM",
    "date": "28-02-2019 02:07:00 PM",
    "content": "Back on 3rd August 2018, in a group effort involving a number in our team we posted this “Beginner’s Guide to How Dispatch Works, and how Prices are Set in the NEM” . It’s critical that readers understand that ( as noted here ) the NEM works with price -based dispatch where the marginal unit(s) set the price received by all generators. As guest author Allan O’Neil noted here on January 11th : “Fundamental to marginally priced markets is that prices are set by the last supply or demand reduction offer dispatched in order to balance supply and demand, after (in principle) arranging the volumes offered in order of increasing price. So it is the pricing of offers that fall at around the total demand level on the cumulative bid stack that is critical, rather than the average level of pricing across all market offers. ” … so Allan goes on to say that: “With the current supply-demand balance in the NEM, gas and hydro generators are frequently the marginal price setting plant” … you can review Allan’s article , which focused more specifically on why prices through 2018 remained stubbornly high. ——————– In the 6 months that have passed since our Beginner’s Guide was published, we have received numerous queries about when we might be posting the next edition – the Intermediate Guide , if you like. In this post, we endeavour to to part of this, in that: 1) We hope we deliver, in the following, a clear enough explanation of why the NEM operates (in the “real world”) at a much more complex level than that covered in the Beginner’s Guide. 1a) In other words, we hope you understand, through this post, that reality is much more complex than simple theory. 1b) Unfortunately, much of the discussion we’ve seen (e.g. on social media) about Price Setter seems to exist only down at that Beginner’s Guide level. 2) However note that it’s not intended in this post that we actually fully explain all the nuances in these complexities. We don’t have time to do this currently, but hope to return later to provide more of a fuller Intermediate Guide at some point in the months ahead (certainly after we’ve completed our Generator Report Card 2018 , and the work that will flow on from that into our products like ez2view and NEMreview ). In recent times we’ve been fielding a growing number of calls from various people asking to know more about “who’s been setting the price” in the electricity market. In part these questions have been spurred by the AEMO’s inclusion of trends in various reports (such as Figure 5 and Figure 6 in their Q4 2018 Quarterly Energy Dynamics report *) As an aside, we’d like to note that these Quarterly Reviews are an excellent initiative , in our view. Thanks to AEMO for delivering something that had been missing beforehand! It seems pitched at about the right level (given the types of questions we keep hearing from new entrants, spectators and commentators). Various others (such as Allan here ) have also been referring to stats focused answering the same basic question. These various analysts and publishers all seem to be basing their trends on interpretation of the data published in AEMO’s Price Setter files . (A) An introduction to AEMO’s Price Setter file The AEMO started publishing these Price Setter files a number of years ago in response to Registered Participant requests to understand more detail about how NEMDE was actually determining price – because the price setting process is more complex than the simple bid stack analogies in our Beginner’s Guide would suggest. These Price Setter files do a reasonable* job at explaining the multi-dimensional complexities involved in setting 45 prices in every dispatch interval (i.e. price for 5 regions, for Energy and 8 FCAS commodities). However they are not simple. Noting (only?) a “reasonable” job is not meant as a criticism – just a reflection that it’s actually a whole lot more complex than we might initially think, if our thinking is at Beginner’s Guide level – as I hope this article will illustrate quantitatively….. We’ve been including these Price Setter files in our ez2view software (used by wholesale participants and others who have significant exposure to the wholesale market in some form) for a number of years, enabling clients to drill into particular dispatch intervals forensically to understand the specifics of what went on in those dispatch intervals of high interest. However in more recent times, we have been investigating how else we might use these Price Setter files in other ways to help expand what we do in making complexity understandable to our broad range of clients: 1) For a start, we are calculating (and trending) a measure of Aggregated “RRP Contribution Factor” on an individual DUID basis for inclusion inside our Generator Report Card 2018 . This work is currently underway (but not yet completed) so I can’t be definitive about specifically what has been done. 2) Following from the completion of the Generator Report Card 2018 , we will be taking the lessons we’ve learnt in dealing with a complete history of Price Setter data files over a number of years and applying these lessons in the enhancement of our existing software products in a number of ways: 2a) For our ez2view (higher-end) product, we will be enhancing in some considerable depth – making full use of these insights. 2b) Reflecting the more generalised analysis completed by our NEMreview clients (who tend more to be analysts sitting on the outside of the wholesale market, looking in) we will be applying the learnings we have made, but also striving to retain a level of clarity reflecting the fact that these clients may never have been involved within the wholesale market directly, so quite unfamiliar with Price Setter (and the complexities noted in this preliminary Intermediate Guide). In this post I hope we clarify some of our reasoning in what we are doing. If you have specific questions about the increasing number of ways in which we’re utilizing the raw data published in AEMO’s Price Setter files, please call us (+61 7 3368 4064) or use this Feedback Form . (B) Categories of Complexity in Price Setter In the process of assembling the historical series of price setter files for our Generator Report Card 2018, we* have defined the following categories for getting some statistical sense of the level of complexity involved in the price setting process. * As we have been the ones to define the categories, readers should be aware that it’s not an “official” categorisation in that sense, and that someone else might have a somewhat different division of outcomes per dispatch interval and region (as we might ourselves, on a different day). The purpose of this categorisation exercise is merely just to help explain the scale of the complexity , in terms of numbers of dispatch intervals involved. Readers should be aware that we’re intending these categories to be used only for ENERGY prices (not any FCAS commodity), for each dispatch in each separate region. Category Description (1) Very Simple In this Very Simple category, we assume that the price for ENERGY in a Region is set equal to the marginal bid price band for ENERGY of a single DUID in that Region . This “Very Simple” category is that most aligned with the level of explanation (and thinking) suited to our Beginner’s Guide – and also elsewhere at beginner’s level. See below to see how few dispatch intervals actually fit into this simple model. Based on discussions with many people in recent times, our suspicion is that this will be a surprise for a significant number of people. (2) Simple As you’ll note below, there are well more than half the dispatch intervals that don’t fall into the “Very Simple” category. On a reasonable number of occasions, this has been primarily because it’s more than one DUID involved in setting the price – where still: • It’s only offers for Energy involved; and where • It’s multiple DUIDs within a single station involved ; and • The DUIDs must be in the region in question; but where • The RRP (Regional Reference Price) is just the ROP (Regional Override Price) (3) Slightly Complex In the next category we take another step towards complexity, in that we look for cases where the Energy Price (in that region): • Has a number of contributing DUIDs, but from different Stations ; • Which then might be in different Regions ; but still • Only offers for Energy; and still where • The RRP (Regional Reference Price) is just the ROP (Regional Override Price) . . It’s important to note in this category that it’s almost certain , where multiple stations are involved, that the relative contributions of the DUIDs across these stations won’t be equal – and it might be that some make a fairly dominant contribution whilst others make smaller contributions to the ROP. (4) Complex Next step along the complexity journey is where we acknowledge that: • The Price for Energy might be set, at least in part, by Bids made for FCAS Services (i.e. because of co-optimisation). • In this case it’s almost certain there will be Multiple stations involved (but only DUIDs involved in setting the price, as distinct from Category 5); and still where • The RRP (Regional Reference Price) is just the ROP (Regional Override Price) . . It’s been our experience that, in numerous conversations, that the co-optimisation process (and hence the effect that FCAS bids can have on the energy price) is frequently overlooked or forgotten. (5) Very Complex This category will catch all the Dispatch Intervals not covered in the category above, and hence will include • Instances where the Regional Reference Price is adjusted from the ROP because of a range of different reasons (e.g. Price is Capped, there is Load Shedding etc); and/or where • Other factors (not just DUIDs) are involved in setting the price. (C) Examples of these Categories Applying these categories above to the Price Setter files for all Regions for all Dispatch Intervals from 1st Jan 2018 through until sometime on 5th February 2019 reveals an informative distribution that is different for different regions, as follows: Category QLD Region NSW Region VIC Region TAS Region SA Region (1) Very Simple 4296 DIs 3.7% of time 11,469 DIs 10.0% of time 21,471 DIs 18.6% of time 47,503 DIs 41.2% of time 9,674 DIs 8.4% of time (2) Simple 34,893 DIs 30.2% of time 30,540 DIs 26.5% of time 4,992 DIs 4.3% of time 0 DIs 0% of time 10,493 DIs 9.1% of time (3) Slightly Complex 54,799 DIs 47.6% of time 52,901 DIs 45.9% of time 64,939 DIs 56.4% of time 16,427 DIs 14.1% of time 70,217 DIs 60.9% of time (4) Complex 21,215 DIs 18.4% of time 20,272 DIs 17.6% of time 23,609 DIs 20.5% of time 51,476 DIs 44.7% of time 24,643 DIs 21.4% of time (5) Very Complex 43 DIs <1% of time 64 DIs <1% of time 232 DIs <1% of time 18 DIs <1% of time 216 DIs <1% of time A couple of things jump out at me that I’d like to highlight for a start: 1) For a start, we see a significant percentage of time (roughly 20% in mainland regions, and a massive 45% in Tassie) where bids to supply FCAS services are involved in the price set for Energy . 2) In Category 1 for NSW and VIC we see a higher percentage of time than is the case for QLD. Without looking in detail at the data, which is still to be done for the Generator Report Card 2018, my suspicion is that this is because the Snowy Hydro stations are operating as single DUID stations. Similar scenario for most of the hydro generators in Tasmania. 3) We see in all regions that more than 58% of the time (80% of the time in SA), the Price in that region is set by contributions from more than one Station. Or, to flip that around, it’s significantly less than 40% of the time in all of the mainland regions that the price is set in the “Simple” or “Very Simple” way we talk about in the Beginner’s Guide (and which seems to be the common, but over-simplistic, understanding* of the average “NEM Spectator and Commentator”). * That’s an example of Villain no 4 in action, and an example where (I hope) this article will go some way to helping alleviate To illustrate each of the 5 categories above, we’ve picked a single Region/DI combination from recent weeks to provide an example of what we mean in the categories – and used Time Travel in ez2view to dig forensically as follows: (C1) Example of Category 1 – Very Simple It’s sometimes noted that us Queenslanders like the simpler life – though I note that it’s only 3.7% of the time that we see a “Very Simple” outcome in terms of a single DUID in the Queensland region setting the Energy Price for Queensland. I thought I would start by highlighting one of the relatively rare examples that have occurred over the past 14 months – focusing specifically on the 22:00 dispatch interval back on 4th February – highlighted in this snapshot from ez2view in Time Travel mode: Click on image for a full-screen view. In the case shown here, we see a case where a bid from Swanbank E sets the price directly in the Queensland region (Category 1 = Very Simple), and also propagates through to the other mainland regions to play the sole role (with dynamic inter-regional losses) in setting the price in NSW, VIC and SA (not Category 1 in those cases!) (C2) Example of Category 2 – Simple Stepping up the complexity (though only slightly) to the “Simple” category – we expand the filter to allow multiple DUIDs at one station to set the price. As an example of this we roll the clock forward a few hours to 03:00 on Tuesday 5th February 2019 in Victoria, when we see the following: Click on image for a full-screen view. As seen in the table above, there’s a reasonable number of instances (close to 40% in some regions) where Price Setter outcomes are at this level, or Very Simple. However that leaves a large number of instances (the majority!) that are not…. (C3) Example of Category 3 – Slightly Complex Given that I already invested the time to dig into the reasons why the price spiked in NSW unexpectedly in the 16:15 dispatch interval on Thursday 31st January 2019 , I’m saving myself some time by linking into this here. In that article, I included this snapshot from ez2view that highlighted (on the Price Setter widget) how Upper Tumut and Torrens B (units 1 and 2) were both involved in setting the price in NSW for that dispatch interval. That’s: (a) Two different fuel types both involved – Hydro, and Gas (b) Units in two different regions involved – NSW, and SA via the interconnected NEM. For those who like to look at aggregated data for “how much the [FuelTypeIHateorLike] has set the price”, there’s an open question about how you would classify this one. Remember that DI outcomes are in this category or worse for >58% of the time. Genuinely happy to take Your Suggestions on that one! That particular example is also a good one to highlight how two things can be simultaneously true : True #1 = the Price Setter file nominates both Torrens and Upper Tumut as being marginal units, and hence their bids setting the price; however Also True #2 = my earlier article also highlighted a number of other factors contributing to why the price was what it was (demand up, intermittent supply down, imports dropped (due in part to bidding behaviour, one of the comments notes), reduced capacity at Mt Piper 2, and the list would go on…). Readers should take this as a note of caution about reading too much into Price Setter in isolation to all the other factors that contribute to making the price outcome what it is on all occasions. (C4) Example of Category 4 – Complex As shown in the table above, a staggering 44% of the time we see that price outcomes for Energy in TAS are in the Complex category (for instance, that FCAS bids are involved in the way the Energy price is set). Hence we thought it would be useful to highlight one of those particular cases – being 23:05 on 16th January 2019 via Time Travel in ez2view : Click on image for a full-screen view. As per the annotation, there’s not enough time now to explain all of what went on within that dispatch interval for the price of Energy in Tassie, but three highlights are: (a) There’s no contribution in Price Setter from any ENERGY offers in Tassie (or Energy Supply anywhere!) to setting the Tassie Energy Price; (b) The bid by Hornsdale Power Reserve to suck power out of the grid as a load (in SA) plays a big role in setting the price for Energy in Tassie (and note that the contribution is more than the price ends up being). (c) There are numerous FCAS bids (in Tassie and elsewhere) that are involved in making contributions to the Tassie Energy Price – some positive and some negative contributions, with the net effect being that it reduces the Total Band Cost back down towards the final RRP. Yep, price setting can be Complex! And it is so for close to 20% of all dispatch intervals on the mainland (44% of the time in TAS) … (C5) Example of Category 5 – Very Complex … but in a (thankfully small) number of cases (<1% of the time in each region) it becomes even more complex than the above. We see a total of 216 dispatch intervals for South Australia in the table above, so I have singled out one of these for the example here – being 15:20 on 29th January 2019 via Time Travel in ez2view : Click on image for a full-screen view. I certainly don’t have time to explain all of what’s happening in this Very Complex dispatch interval for Price Setter in the South Australian region. (D) “Who’s involved in setting the price?” is larger than just Price Setter Readers should exercise caution, however, in not misconstruing what the “Price Setter” files mean. For instance, they do not mean that these were the only factors involved in setting the price where it was. I alluded to this in my comments about Category 3 above, and the example of why the price spiked in NSW unexpectedly in the 16:15 dispatch interval on Thursday 31st January 2019 . Hence please take caution to not become myopic in an obsessive scrutiny of “Price Setter” files whilst neglecting the broader factors that can all contribute to why a price outcome is what it is! ——— We’ll certainly be trying to provide that broader perspective in our Generator Report Card 2018. Now back to the analysis for that…",

    "date": "27-02-2019 05:33:00 PM",
    "content": "We’ve known for a couple days that the weather forecast is for a late hot blast to close out summer 2018-19 in South Australia and Victoria later this week . I’d checked some of our dashboard back then and did not see anything sufficient to distract us from the intensive data crunching, analysis and explanations that are underway for our Generator Report Card 2018 (delivery date rushing closer – current ETA is early April), so had been comfortable to leave the shorter-term analysis alone for a while. —————— However this afternoon I noticed two Market Notices via NEMwatch v10, our entry level dashboard: At 13:22 the AEMO published this Market Notice talking about a forecast LOR2 condition expected late on Friday 1st March: … not an everyday occurrence, and also seen a bit more frequently (my sense – frequency not statistically verified) more recently following the change to the PASA processes, and also after the closure of Hazelwood. Note the LOR2 warning was revoked at 14:58 At 14:40 today we also saw this notice talking about “Generator Recall Information” in relation to this standing operating procedure : … and I could not recall seeing something like that before. Searching the entire history of Market Notices through that widget in ez2view found only one other instance when such a notice about “Generator Recall” was issued – on Monday 31st December 2018 where Notice #66231 was issued pertaining to forecasts for 3rd January 2019. In the earlier years, perhaps they did a similar thing but not using the specific term “Generator Recall”? Given I had looked a couple days ago and had not seen anything too remarkable, I wondered what had changed . Thankfully we’re making that easier and easier to see (so much so that writing up these posts is taking a much longer percentage of the time!) Using some pre-prepared web-based trends created with ez2view online, I took a quick look at forecasts for Victoria and South Australia as they currently stand in the late afternoon of Wednesday 27th February, looking forward into Friday. Here’s the view for Victoria ( using the trend which clients can access here ): Note that the forecast demand for Victoria (Demand and Non-Scheduled Generation) is just above 9,000MW – so still 1,400MW below the record, though that was experienced in the days prior to Hazelwood closure, which reset the supply/demand balance equation to some extent. Here’s the analogous trend for South Australia (using the pre-configured trend that clients can access here for live updates): Again demand forecast (at less than 3,000MW) is high, but not startling (not as high as on 24th January, for instance). What jumped out at me was the pretty steep drop in forecast output for intermittent generation in the region – as noted, it jumped out at me as it did not match with my memory of what I had seen a couple days ago when I checked. If AEMO are seeing revised forecasts for poorer wind conditions in conjunction with a hot evening, this would be some reason why they are looking to recall scheduled plant to cover a range of possible supply/demand scenarios. —————— Thankfully with Forecast Convergence in installed ez2view, we’re progressively making it easier to look at real numbers to see if these hunches are correct – this is a never-ending ongoing improvement process. Here’s a quick look juxtaposing a view of aggregate UIGF and Intermittent Generation on the left and Surplus Generation on the right, with both focused on the verticals for Friday evening in South Australia. We can see that both have changed: I’ve added a couple comments to clarify the flat image, which misses the mouse-over functionality in the real application. We see that the forecast for Friday evening’s contribution from intermittent supplies did drop significantly between different ST PASA forecast runs today – and that there also is a drop in the forecast surplus generation in the South Australian region (in negative territory up towards the import capacity from Victoria, which will also be hot at the same time). However there seems a time gap between the changes in the updated ST PASA runs (per the notes on the image). If I had more time, I would investigate further… —————— However that’s all for now – back into the Generator Report Card 2018 …",

    "title": "Factors contributing to an unforeseen price spike in NSW at 16:15 on Thursday 31st January 2019",
    "date": "21-02-2019 08:45:00 AM",
    "content": "As frequent readers would be aware, we’ve been investing considerable resources (both hours internally, and dollars externally) in the development of our Generator Report Card 2018 (page updated with a bit more detail) in conjunction with collaborative partners in that venture, Greenview Strategic Consulting. A rough guess is that we’ve easily invested easily many thousands of hours – and are seeing a number of interesting things in the data (with the task transitioning to reporting on them). … which is why it is nice for a change to think about something a little different. ——————– I received a call recently from an Energy User who is a client of ours. This energy user is one of the growing number we work with that ( as described here ) have some form of spot exposure in their retail procurement arrangements, and so watch spot prices with the option of curtailing when prices exceed their trigger levels as part of a physical hedge – a form of Demand Response. The dispatch price spiked at 16:15 on Thursday 31st January and it was not previously forecast in predispatch (and my inference is that it hurt) so they were conducting a bit of an investigation to why this happened – and what they could do about it. I walked through through a couple of things at the time, but promised to have more of a look and put something together for them. Given the time it’s taken to do this (and because we know this will be more generally useful) I’ve posted it here and will let them know. (A) Why it matters, for Energy Users like these As noted before , there’s a sizeable – though notably opaque – volume (in MW demand terms) of energy consumption in the NEM that delivers a form of “demand response” that’s triggered as a result of some form of exposure to spot prices. We’ve been involved with a fair number of these customers as noted here – some for more than a decade. Because they respond to spot prices as they are published, this offers an advantage that they can secure a lower average cost of energy by incorporating physical curtailment as a hedge, as guest author Mike Williams noted here . However the facts that forecasts are not firm (and necessarily do change as market conditions change) also means some residual exposure. That’s why we have listed this (i.e. lack of firmness in forward pricing) as one of the real barriers we have experienced to more widespread adoption of demand response . We’ll note more (when time permits) about what we can do to help energy users with this one). (B) Why did the 16:15 price spike surprise us? For some context, I have included a trend here from our online Trends Engine that could be created by both our NEMreview clients, and those using ez2view online. For clarity I have highlighted the particular period of elevated pricing late in the afternoon on Thursday 31st January: I’ve also highlighted how: The demand on that Thursday was up around 14,000MW , which is quite a high level for NSW. Also, the NSW demand was more than 1,000MW higher than the level experienced the day before, and yet available generation capacity was much the same … both indicators of increased risk of price volatility. Using Time Travel in the installed version of ez2view and showing three copies of the same widget side-by-side (just at different points in time) we see how the price spike of particular interest evolved (click on the image for a large-screen view): We can see clearly the challenge that faced the particular energy user in question – the price spike was not telegraphed, in advance, in P5 predispatch forecasts . In prior articles (like those which Google finds for you here ) I’ve used the “Forecast Convergence” widget in ez2view to provide a picture of how certain aspects of AEMO’s forecasts change over time, sometimes unexpectedly – as in the case of the price outcomes above. To start with, I have used Forecast Convergence to re-assemble the same three price snapshots above into one widget as follows: We first added this widget to ez2view some years ago, but more recently have been adding in some enhancements (additional data sets and functionality), some of which is highlighted below. (B1) AEMO’s expectations of “market demand” increased Flipping the widget to now look at AEMO’s forecasts for demand on the same basis, we identify one of the factors that led to the price outcome being higher than forecast: As noted on the image, we see that the Scheduled Demand outcome (in terms of the TOTALDEMAND target number used in NEMDE to produce the dispatch price outcome) was 88MW higher than that forecast just 5 minutes before that, and higher still than the forecast 5 minutes before that. Let’s call that “Contributing Factor #1” . Incidentally, we also see (presumably at least in part as a result of the price spike) that the Scheduled Demand dropped by about 200MW to 16:50 (i.e. 13,823MW to 13,626MW), as another indicator of the presence of (spot exposed, and presumably automated) Demand Response in the NEM. (B2) Aggregate supply from Intermittent plant dropped Flipping again to another option in Forecast Convergence, we look at how the AEMO’s forecasts for the aggregate output of intermittent generation in NSW changed leading into the price spike: As noted on this image, we see that the contribution of intermittent generation was lower (by 49MW) than that forecast immediately prior to the event. Let’s call that “Contributing Factor #2” – however note that there is some overlap between this and the increased expectation of Scheduled Demand, which needed to be met by dispatching more scheduled generation. Some of the gory details of how demand is measured in real time was explained here . (B3) Imports from Victoria dropped Flipping again to select the Interconnectors option and look at flow on the VIC-NSW interconnector, we see the actual target flow north from VIC in the 16:45 dispatch interval (i.e. 598MW) was 110MW lower than had been forecast in the P5 forecast immediately before that: The colour-coding in this case focuses on the greater change in flow north from 16:45 to 16:50 in response to the price spike, but it is the smaller magnitude change (from 16:40 to 16:45) that was the next contributing factor to the price spike in the first place. Let’s call that “Contributing Factor #3” – however it’s a simplification to call a change in target flow a contributing factor, as the target flow is an outcome from the NEMDE run, and not an input. Target flows are what NEMDE calculates that they need to be to solve the Objective Function* for a dispatch interval. * In simple terms, the Objective Function is to minimise the aggregate cost of Energy and the 8 x FCAS commodities across all regions of the NEM collectively, where participant bids for Energy and FCAS are treated as costs and the solve is typically subject to between 500-800 discrete constraint equations. For those who want to understand more, we’re increasingly called on to arrange training , utilising the services of external consultants who are more knowledgeable than us. In simple terms, to understand the real contributing factors that lie behind the reduced target import from Victoria, we would need to look behind that to understand what was lying behind that reduction. No time to do that in detail now, but I will flag that the constraint equation “V>>N-NIL_HG” was bound at 16:10 and 16:15 , having the effect on limiting imports from Victoria – and also acting to limit output of some scheduled (e.g. Uranquinty, Blowering, Tumut 3 and Murray) and semi-scheduled plant (e.g. Silverton Wind Farm, Broken Hill Solar) as well: (B4) Small increase in imports from QLD Flipping to look at target flow on the QNI interconnector (remembering that negative numbers are flows south from QLD into NSW) we see that the target flow barely changed from 16:10 to 16:15: However we do note that the import at 16:15 is 61MW larger than that forecast 5 minutes before , hence this would have partially offset the (110MW) reduction in imports from Victoria compared to what was forecast. (B5) Generation supply within NSW As with constraints (above), so it is that there are levels of complexity in how generator bids are taken into account in the dispatch process. I don’t have much time to drill into this today, but would add in this snapshot from 16:15 on which I have annotated a couple things. In quick order: (B5a) Multiple units, some in SA, involved in setting the NSW spot price We see that it’s a partially dispatched bid from Upper Tumut (i.e. 48MW target of 540MW offered at $13,199.90 at the RRN) that is making a large contribution to where the price actually lands. However it’s also important to note that the remaining contribution to the price comes from outside the NSW region . It’s a 28% share of the uplift from the offers at Torrens B1 and B2 (which are both at $101.00 at the SA Region RRN). The Bids from Torrens set the price in South Australia, and also VIC (adjusted for dynamic inter-regional loss factor), and also in NSW as well; The “Increase” column does not sum to Unity, because of the complexity of the co-optimisation process (incl inter-regional losses). (B5b) No capacity offered, by anyone, in between $300/MWh and $13,199.60/MWh The second thing that jumps out is that there is lots of empty space between the volume offered by Vales Point at the cap price of $300/MWh and the volume that was required to be dispatched on this occasion at Upper Tumut. This kind of “tipping point ” is a natural function of market outcome considering that demand on the day in NSW was up close to 14,000MW (i.e. not too far away from its all-time maximum levels). The fact that the price had jumped from $252.51/MWh (at 16:05) to $348.76/MWh (at 16:10) just beforehand was a good clue that we were on a knife edge (see 2nd image above). (B5c) Some rebids flagged We’ve highlighted the rebids (see note 1) made just in time for incorporation in the 16:15 dispatch run (i.e. submitted just prior to the cut-off before the 16:10 commencement of the dispatch interval). Box Note 1 As part of our Generator Report Card 2018 , we’re taking a detailed look at rebids. In this earlier article , I noted how we were classifying the bids according to the most recent AER Rebidding Guidelines. Readers will note that none of the rebids highlighted are “Well Formed”, if applying a strict interpretation of the AER’s guidelines , because of a number of factors: (1) EnergyAustralia’s rebid for Mt Piper included the “~” character instead of spaces. (2) Snowy’s rebids for Guthega include colons (and seconds!) in the portion that AER asks to be just HHMM. (3) Origin Energy’s rebids for Uranquinty did not include a space between HHMM and the Category. These differences seem a bit like splitting hairs (especially as the 3 patterns noted above seem fairly consistent for the portfolios – and, we presume, just probably an outcome of the pre-existing bidding software the portfolios use), hence we have loosened the filtering to incorporate these sorts of patterns. However that still does leave a fair number (in numerical terms) of rebids “Not Well Formed” across the entire set of rebids over the past 2 years – with examples further below. These rebids are from three different entities: 1) Reduced capacity at Mt Piper Unit 2 From rebid reasons through the day, it appears that EnergyAustralia had been having problems with coal supplies (and flow-on effects in its coal mills). Coincident with the price spike, we see that capacity offered at Mt Piper Unit 2 was reduced by 90MW. Now this 90MW of capacity had not been dispatched in the 16:10 dispatch interval (that same 90MW had only just been added back at 16:05 in what seems like a premature recovery), but it looks like it would have been called on to dispatch in response to the other factors above (increase in demand, drop in intermittent generation and reduction in imports from Victoria). Let’s call this “Contributing Factor #4” . 2) Capacity added back in at Guthega We also see that (prior to the start of the 16:15 dispatch interval) Snowy Hydro had returned the 67MW capacity offered for Guthega to the market: However this returned capacity was offered in at $14,000/MWh at the RRN (we see in the “Current Bids” widget above), so too high to even be dispatched during the price spike. 3) Increase in volume available at Uranquinty Finally, we see that there was a small increase in capacity at each of the 4 x Uranquinty units with the rebid reason referencing Ambient Conditions (see note 2) , so presumably the temperature had dropped a little: Given that this increase in capacity was slotted into Origin’s $87.03/MWh bid band for Uranquinty (at the RRN) we can see it has been gratefully dispatched by AEMO. Box Note 2 As part of our Generator Report Card 2018 , we’re endeavoring to take a detailed look at how ambient conditions seem to affect the capability of all generators across the NEM. That’s one of the tasks that has not been done, yet. However there will also have been a slight catch as a result of this – remembering that Uranquinty is also on the LHS of the same bound constraint that is affecting imports from VIC (discussed above). All else being equal, this 6MW increase in supply from Uranquinty would have had the effect of reducing imports from Victoria by about 2.8MW (ratio of the LHS factors). Because of the bid price offered by Uranquinty (relative to spare capacity in VIC and SA – remembering Torrens is at the margin), NEMDE calculates that this is worthwhile. (B5d) Capacity disappears further down the bid stack Whilst talking about bids, however, it’s important to caution about the need to look at more than just what happens at the margin. Looking further down the bid stack, we see one representation of aggregate bids from all Wind and Large Solar plant in NSW: We’ve highlighted the drop in output that resulted from the withdrawal of capacity from the dispatch process (energy constraint induced, and facilitated via AWEFS and ASEFS by AEMO acting on behalf of the participant). As noted above, this was Contributing Factor #2 in delivering the price spike. Note that the volume lost to the market noted here (40MW from 16:10 to 16:15) is different than what’s noted above for a couple reasons: (a) This calculation is effectively walking up the diagonal in Forecast Convergence (not the vertical, which would be the better measure. Here’s a view of the same in Forecast Convergence, but note that the AEMO does not appear to publish the “old” P5 predispatch targets for DUIDs (though they do for P30) despite the fact that the MMS Data Model suggests (we think) that they should be “Public Next Day” : (b) There’s also a difference in the make-up of the data sets aggregating DUID-level data for Wind and Solar when compared to what comes out of the UIGF + INTERMITTENT GENERATION. Box Note 3 Also, we’ve added a comment about most of the rebids in use at 16:15 here being “Not Well Formed” – refer Note 1 above (and this prior article ) for more context (B6) Summing up… Summing up what’s above (and noting that I don’t have time to dig further at this point) I’d reiterate that there were at least 4 factors contributing to the price spike : Factor #1 = Demand increased more than forecast Factor #2 = Aggregate supply from intermittent supply dropped unexpectedly Factor #3 = Imports from Victoria dropped more than forecast; and Factor #4 = Capacity was withdrawn from Mt Piper because of coal issues. It’s highly likely there are other factors as well – we know this, given the levels of complexity we’ve seen in drilling into other dispatch intervals of interest. (C) What are the implications of this? Don’t have much time today, just want to flag: (C1) Implications for us, and our particular client First and foremost, we know we have a customer which has been unpleasantly surprised by a price spike. Even this single dispatch interval will have been painful (hence their call to us as part of their investigation of what happened). We mentally model each dispatch interval of the Curtailment Challenge (i.e. the actual price, and the prediction/forecast some time before that) falling into one of these quadrants of a matrix: From prior conversations with a range of energy users practicing demand response, it’s very clear to us that: the relative value weightings for trading off the Red and the Orange quadrants will be very different from client-to-client; AND is also likely to vary considerably from time-to-time (e.g. in response to changes in their Order Book, or what Hedge they have in place, or their Appetite for Risk, or for other reasons…). It’s quite a complex space, but we have made steps more recently with a couple pre-existing clients to step beyond just our deSide® energy-user product to look further into leading indicators of volatility to deliver a “Defcon Rating” specifically tailored to their own particular market perspective . That’s something noted briefly here . Hence an action for us is to follow up directly with that particular client to explore, with them, ways we can serve them better. (C2) Implications for the broader market, as the transition gathers pace The NEM is becoming more complex – and it’s happening at the same time as we see an influx of a greater number of stakeholders looking to be active in (or at least involved with) the wholesale market in some way – including: Energy users, such as the one flagged in this post (and we expect more to come, as these real barriers continue to be surmounted); and New entrant generators, such as those who appear to need some assistance in complying with the AER Rebidding Guidelines. That confluence of two significant trends (and the ongoing attrition of institutional/reform memory) is the reason why I’ve talked about Villain no 4 before. ——————– As a company that strives to continually be improving in “making complexity understandable, so people can make better decisions”, we understand that it’s an opportunity for us. Part of the reason for us to invest heavily in the collaborative Generator Report Card 2018 , for instance. Now back to that…",

    "content": "AEMO forecasted that this might happen days ago ( as noted here on Monday this week ), so we’ve been keeping some of our dashboard screens focused on Queensland today whilst focusing our main attention on the KPI formulation, number crunching and analysis required to provide for the completion of our Generator Report Card 2018 . —————— Queenslanders did not disappoint, turning up their air-conditioners late in the afternoon in parallel with the ramp-down of solar PV injections to push demand past the prior peak (which was 9,924MW on a dispatch target basis for Scheduled Demand almost exactly a year ago), up past the 10,000MW mark to land at a new all-time maximum demand level of 10,052MW in the 16:55 dispatch interval – which was captured here in this snapshot from NEMwatch v10: Here’s a few quick notes this evening that might be of interest: (A) The different measures of electricity demand I could not help but notice that both AEMO and Powerlink were on social media, also noting about the new record in peak demand for the Queensland region. What I particularly noted was that the specific numbers quoted (and times) were a little different: On top of that was what I posted via Twitter and LinkedIn – plus presumably others as well. Also different! Welcome to the world of electricity sector metrics… It’s a dream sector for the numerically-inclined engineers and economists (we’ll be counting further tomorrow, but I think we’re now well over 60 discrete metrics we’re slicing and dicing for our our Generator Report Card 2018 , for instance). A concept as seemingly simple as electricity demand has given birth to numerous different Demand metrics (as explained in some detail here) , each useful in their own way but none of them perfect. Taking a look at a number of them together through our NEMreview v7 online data query tool , we see the following review of today. No matter which way you cut these numbers, a new record in peak demand for Queensland. (B) How did AEMO’s forecasts for the demand peak converge on reality? In my note on Monday this week , I included a snapshot of the “Forecast Convergence” widget within ez2view focused on AEMO’s forecasts for Scheduled Demand in Queensland for this evening (i.e. TOTAL DEMAND, in the NEMreview chart above). At the time these forecasts were in the ST PASA time horizon. Here’s an updated view from this evening, focusing on the nearer-term (P30 predispatch) forecasts for the same metric, and a tracking of how the Scheduled Demand actually proceeded on a trading period (i.e. half-hourly) basis: I’ve annotated a couple parts of the charts to highlight the type of complexity that the AEMO forecasting team have to grapple with day-in-day-out (with it just being noticed a bit more externally, perhaps, on key note days like today?) These challenges look set to grow more complex in future… (C) How did solar contribute? As noted in my post on Monday , there’s plenty of interest in how solar PV injections will have contributed to managing the supply/demand balance in the Queensland region today: Interest Area #1) Some people will be particularly interested from the point of view of the emissions reduction component. Interest Area #2) Others will be more financially invested in the revenue earned (or costs defrayed) from their own solar PV injections Interest Area #3) Still others will be interested from the perspective of what they might learn today (where solar is still a relatively small share of the energy mix) that might be carried forward in insights that can be applied to understand what might be the case in 5-10 years time as the transition has progressed when the contribution rate is much higher, and grid (and market) will need to be sustainably managing these injections. Each is valid, and important – though it’s also important to understand that each person’s interests will be slightly different. (C1) My solar at home I’ve previously posted these initial thoughts about our own personal experiences as a (admittedly smaller scale) solar powered generator at home . I continue to have a keen interest in what’s going on in that space as well and am grateful for the visibility provided by Solar Analytics in conjunction with WattWatchers. Accessing my account this afternoon, I am pleased to see a fairly smooth curve of solar harvest through the day, meaning good revenue generation at my very generous net FIT (44c/kWh from the government plus the retailer add-on): However I am also concerned about what seems to be a lost revenue opportunity in the day, as annotated on the chart. My system is a 5kW system, but the peak output (on a very sunny summer’s day) was down at 3.77kW down at 12:15 today. In the larger-scale generator space, we’re working through the levels of de-rating seen for large-scale solar farms (and also wind, gas, coal, hydro and other) that are resulting from high temperatures seen as summers get warmer – all to be discussed in our Generator Report Card 2018 . At the much smaller scale (though also much more directly related to us) I wonder about the reasons for our own generator de-rating at home. I speculate whether it might be because of some combination of the following: Factor #1 – voltage on the local network on our street, and some form of limitation on output imposed by the inverter (i.e. following on from these other thoughts about local voltage in the street where I live ); Factor #2 – some form of temperature limitation on the panels (it would be pretty hot on our roof currently) that is limiting production capability; and/or Factor #3 – a degradation in capability due to age of the asset. Factor #4 – my panels need a clean (i.e. other than just assuming that rain will do the job). Factor #5 – not ideal incidence of the sun in the sky – but it is still summer, and my panels face north on a relatively flat roof with no shading issues? Factor #6 – something I’m not aware of in the list above. If any of our more learned readers can help me out in that respect, I would be very interested! Please either: 1) Leave a comment below, if you want them to be public; or 2) Just with us, via this feedback form ; or 3) Give me a call on +61 7 3368 4064 . Many thanks, in advance! (C2) Solar on the grid Here’s a snapshot from 18:10 today showing that Queensland Scheduled Demand had moderated by almost exactly 200MW over the 75 minutes since the new record had been set: Also highlighted (bottom-right) was how injections from solar PV (small-scale and large-scale) had dropped by about 400MW over the same period. We see, at a more macro level, how they peaked at over 1,600MW** during the middle hours of the day, with a few perturbations seen in the afternoon as a result of cloud cover. ** Caution should be used in taking this number for aggregate solar and combining it with the demand figures above to try to derive % of demand supplied by solar, as it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison – because of some of the solar being unseen by AEMO in real time (hence netting off demand) whilst some is seen by AEMO and nets off demand. Finally, I’ve noted on the NEMwatch snapshot how the IRPM** for the QLD Economic Island is down at 12% , which is a relatively low level – hence the colour alert. ** IRPM = Instantaneous Reserve Plant Margin, is the excess of available supply over demand. It’s a very useful non-price indicator of the balance between supply and demand and provides good correlation with elevated prices (when IRPM drops below 15%). The fact that the price was only $142.73 and the number of competing generators in the region had reduced sharply with the fading out of large-scale solar is an indicator that the government-mandated pricing constraints on their (soon to be reshuffled again) GOCs is still alive and well. One of the reasons that IRPM has dropped down so much at this time was because of the fading out of solar, which had a large bearing on the decline in (Energy-Constrained) Available Generation capacity for the region, shown in this NEMwatch chart at the time: No time for more analysis at this point, and back to the Generator Report Card tomorrow – but will watch & listen for your thoughts and comments with some keen interest.",

    "title": "Very preliminary review of Quantity and Quality of Rebids suggests some interesting details…",
    "date": "13-02-2019 02:39:00 PM",
    "content": "With the temperature climbing well past comfortable levels outside in Brisbane today, we’re hunkered down in the cool with multiple dashboards up to track whether Queensland will hit a new all-time record level for electricity demand later today . Editor’s Note Queensland did reach an all-time record demand on this day, as noted here . ——————- However our main focus is the ongoing number crunching and analysis leading into the completion of our Generator Report Card 2018 in another month or two. Thanks for the continually growing number of pre-orders, by the way. Today we’ve been delving into one part of the analysis of bidding (and in particular rebidding) we’re conducting as part of this analysis. Whilst stressing that what follows is very preliminary analysis that needs to be checked thoroughly before inclusion in the Generator Report Card, I thought readers might be interested in the following two trends: (A) Number of Rebids for Wind Farms has started to climb In the chart below I have trended the number of discrete rebids counted each month for all wind farms across the NEM: There’s obviously a discontinuity between the bids in the period 2007-2010 and the period from mid 2010 through until now. We believe (though this is to be double-checked) that this is all due to the way in which the wind farms used to deploy automated bidding systems back when they were required to register as (fully) Scheduled, prior to the creation of the Semi-Scheduled category (i.e. at which point NEMMCO, and now AEMO, assumed responsibility for some aspects of the generator’s bidding processes for those in the Semi-Scheduled category). Leaving that aside for the moment, I’d like to also flag the increase in the number of bids seen in the latter months of 2017 and into 2018 . This is shown in the blue trend, which is a 12-month trailing aggregate. Our hypothesis (though this will be confirmed for inclusion in the report) is that this primarily relates to wind farmer’s reactions against either or both: 1) Being constrained down (or sometimes up) through particular constraint equations applied in conjunction with the Semi-Dispatch Cap; and/or 2) Reactions against negative pricing events. Because these are both (at this point) most prevalent in South Australia (particularly with the System Strength constraint), and as many of the wind farms are in South Australia, we expect a high concentration there – however we will know further as we work through the analysis for every individual power station as part of the compilation of our Generator Report Card 2018. Here’s one example we delved into a few months ago about how one particular Wind Farmer in South Australia reacted to both (unexpected negative prices, and the impositions of constraints – in that case asking them to wind up output). The rebidding process appeared totally understandable, though we would not recommend what appeared to be the controlled tripping of output immediately prior to the rebid. (B) Percentage of bids “Not Well Formed” is quite high – using a strict interpretation. In February 2017 the AER published this revised version of the “Rebidding and Technical Parameters Guideline” to replace the previous (December 2009) version. This became effective 28th February 2017 and re-iterated a required form of rebid that was of the form: HHMM {space} Category {space} DDD…D Where: HHMM is the time, in 24-hour format, of the event(s) or other occurrence(s) adduced by the relevant participant as the reason for the rebid occurred. Category is either P for a plant or physical change, A for a AEMO forecast or dispatch change, F for a financial or commercial change or E for a rebid to address an error. DDD…D is a verifiable description of the events or occurrences that explain the rebid. As one of a number of queries we have run on all rebids for the history of the NEM (for every DUID – including for the scheduled load components of batteries and pumped hydro) using a strict interpretation of these guidelines. Whilst it was not surprising at all that the percentage of “Not Well Formed” bids was 100% in the early years of the NEM (i.e. because the guidelines did not apply then) we were quite staggered to see that with this strict interpretation codified in a filter, almost all bids are continue to be “Not Well Formed” . You can see this here: In starting to sift through all rebids (there are quite a few, as you can see) we have uncovered a number of consistent patterns that some portfolios seem to use. Whilst not strictly adhering to the AER’s guidelines (if you wanted to interpret them strictly) they do seem to follow the general intent of the guidelines, in terms of being Some examples of these “Well Formed, if we use a looser interpretation” include: 0118~P~explanationtext 01:18 P explanationtext 01:18:30 P explanationtext with full time including seconds 0118P explanationtext without space between time and reason type We re-run the query and produce the second trend of percentage and see that it drops well below 100% from January 2015 onwards – which is more what we had been expecting. Readers should understand that, even with this looser filtering, there remain something like 3,000-4,000 rebids a year that appear Not Well Formed at all . We have not yet had time to delve into the detail, to see if there are patterns we can see about them coming from certain portfolios, and/or for certain DUIDs. ——————- Again, reiterating that this is a very early cut of this part of the analysis, we are looking forward to delving into considerable detail here as part of the mammoth project underway in compilation of our Generator Report Card 2018 . Comments more than welcome: 1) Below, if you want them to be public; or 2) Just with us, via this feedback form ; or 3) Give us a call on +61 7 3368 4064 .",

    "title": "Looks set for a peak demand in QLD on Wednesday up near the all-time maximum",
    "date": "11-02-2019 09:23:00 AM",
    "content": "Summer’s far from over at this point, it would seem, looking into our set of 7-day ahead regional supply and demand balances we’ve constructed with the web-based Trends Engine bundled with our ez2view software. Here’s what I’ve seen on Monday morning when checking what the forecast is for the Queensland region – noting, in particular, the forecast for very high demand in the Queensland late on Wednesday: Click on the image for a larger static view, and licensed clients can access the live updating trend here to keep tabs on how AEMO’s successive forecast evolve over time. As highlighted on the chart in mouse-over, the peak of “Demand and Non-Scheduled Generation” (i.e. proxy for Operational Demand in the forecast horizon) is forecast to be 9,835MW in the half-hour ending 17:00 NEM time on Wednesday (i.e. QLD time). (A) What about solar? With these sorts of peak demand events it’s interesting to think about solar’s contribution, so for clarity note that: 1) For large-scale solar (of which there is a growing volume in QLD) these volumes should be accounted for in the AEMO’s forecasts (i.e. this contribution will be amongst the generation meeting this demand, not netting off from it). 2) The smaller-scale rooftop PV will act to net off AEMO’s calculations for demand, by meeting consumption requirements before they get to AEMO’s meters (i.e. “demand the AEMO doesn’t see” in real time). 2a) There will still be a reasonable contribution from small-scale rooftop PV at this time (though note prior comments about the faster afternoon declines due to panels facing north, not west ). In the image above I have included a snapshot of the BOM’s forecast, which notes for sunny conditions in Brisbane, which is the hub of the small-scale contribution. Given the size of the installed capacity of rooftop PV in Queensland, the fact that AEMO is forecasting a peak Operational Demand as high as it is suggests a very large underlying demand. 2b) Not also prior comments about the challenges of measuring contributions from small-scale PV . 3) Medium-scale PV is a loose category that sits in between the rooftop PV estimated by APVI based on small-scale systems registered with the Clean Energy Regulator and the larger stuff registered at the AEMO for which they have SCADA data for. There’s a growing volume in this range 100kW to 30MW that (as far as I am aware) has no collective visibility . Readers will be able to watch both large and small in real time on Wednesday afternoon via our RenewEconomy-sponsored NEMwatch Supply & Demand Widget (located on RenewEconomy , on the NEMwatch portal , on WattClarity and a growing number of other places). We’d love to be able to also show medium-scale, so please let us know if you can help us with that ? (B) What’s the all-time maximum demand in Queensland It’s been a couple years since we have had the time to give away a BBQ in our peak demand competition , but that has not diminished our interest in seeing how peak demand** has trended in the past, and how current summers are tracking . Hence we could not leave an opportunity like this pass by without looking backwards. ** though readers should be aware that the nature of supply/demand is changing such that peak demand has become only one of the factors that is determining periods of low instantaneous reserve plant margin – something we will be exploring in our Generator Report Card 2018 , to the extent that time permits. Using the same Trend Engine as above we produce this trend of peak monthly demand in Queensland (using three different measures of demand) over the past few years: For those who want to know more about the different definitions of demand, you can start here with this explainer . Notwithstanding these complexities, the key take-away here is that the peak demand on Wednesday looks set to be very close to an all-time record . A patch of late-afternoon cloud cover over Brisbane (to ramp down rooftop PV, whilst maintaining humidity) might be all it takes. (C) How are the AEMO forecasts trending These AEMO forecasts are updated many times through the day, and will be updated more frequently as we draw closer to reality (that’s what we would expect, given that these forecasts are a key input in operating the market). Using the “Forecast Convergence” widget in the ez2view installed software and in this case flipping to chart view, whilst zooming in to focus on Wednesday’s forecast for Scheduled Demand, we can see that the forecasts grew throughout last week, but have moderated slightly since yesterday (i.e. Sunday) afternoon : Time will tell what actually transpires – we will be watching with keen interest (but somewhere away from the heat!)",

    "title": "AGL Investor Presentation reports on Portfolio Availability–we take a look for key Stations",
    "date": "08-02-2019 12:56:00 PM",
    "content": "Yesterday (Thu 7th February), AGL Energy provided this 2019 Half-Year Results Presentation to investors via the ASX. Page 13 was one flagged to me as a result of several recent discussions: We’re currently buried in the detailed analysis that’s central to the delivery of our Generator Report Card 2018 to the growing number of clients who have pre-ordered (at discounted price – thanks for that! ) and those who will order when it’s completed in another month or two (at normal price). As different aspects of availability (including trip rates, outage lengths and aggregate availability levels) are amongst the metrics we’re assessing in completing this analysis, I thought it worthwhile to have more of a look. Now the chart provided to investors was noted as including data for all thermal plant in their portfolio – so will include: (a) coal units – being Loy Yang A (brown coal), Bayswater & Liddell (black coal) (b) plus more. Given other commitments today I only have time to look at the coal units on a station basis , though we will be looking at all units individually (across all power stations in the NEM, no matter what fuel type) as part of the Generator Report Card. I can understand (it being a half-yearly report) that for investors AGL has chosen to highlight results for four discontinuous 1H periods – however from a technical perspective it seems better to trend data sequentially over time, and to extend trends back to the start of where data is available (which in the case of this data set is October 2001). Noting that this data is preliminary data only, and has not yet been thoroughly checked, here’s what we can see at a quick glance: (A) Availability patterns at Loy Yang A The following chart aggregates availability across the 4 units at the station – both discretely by month, and with a 12-month trailing average: Also on the chart is the equivalent annual volume using Max Capacity at the station, noting the upgrades that have been completed in the past. A few observations with respect to this chart: 1) We have not yet completed the process of delving into the various contributions to unavailability – which include planned maintenance, de-ratings and forced outages. This analysis is being completed 2) I’ve also added a reminder that a 12-month trailing average won’t fully take account of the cyclic nature of major outages on units, as these are carried out less frequently than annual (e.g. every 3 or 4 years) but have a large impact on availability figures for the month or two the outage spans. 3) With this in mind, we do see a slight downward trend in the average level of availability across the past 5 or 6 years. (B) Availability patterns at Bayswater Here’s the same chart for Bayswater – which AGL acquired fully when it completed the acquisition of Macquarie Generation in September 2014: The same notes apply for this as to Loy Yang A above – but we do see a more rapid decline in the average level of availability across the 4 units. Indeed, this appears to have been happening fairly consistently for 15+ years. The reasons behind this will be one interesting aspect of our investigations for the Report Card to delve into. (C) Availability patterns at Liddell Now Liddell has been much in the media in recent years, and is spoken about as a possible motivation behind the current Federal Government’s “big stick” divestment legislation. Hence I was particularly interested to pull this chart up for the ageing (and soon to close?) Liddell Power Station, which also came with the Macquarie Generation acquisition: The first thing that jumps out at me here is the much lower level of availability across the years than either of the other two above. There’s also an unmistakable cyclic nature in this Availability Factor: (a) increasing to around 2009 (b) then declining to a low-point in 2013 in conjunction with a couple pretty poor months in that year, (c) climbing again into 2017 (d) before the start of what appears to be another decline to around the level of approximately 50% (which may well continue into closure). ————– …. now back to our Generator Report Card 2018 , so we can get into more detail for these stations along with all the other ones across the NEM…",

    "title": "2018 – the year fossil fuels began an inexorable decline",
    "date": "07-02-2019 12:33:00 PM",
    "content": "2018 will likely go down as the year that fossil fuels in Australian electricity generation began an inexorable decline, with renewable energy making significant in-roads. These will continue into 2019 and 2020, and almost certainly beyond that. Renewable energy broke through the 20% market share threshold for the first time since the 1970’s, achieving a share of 21.3% across the combination of Australia’s main east and west-coast grids. This was significantly up on 2017’s share of 17%. Much of this growth was concentrated in Australia’s east coast grid, with limited growth in renewable generation in WA or the Northern Territory (confined to rooftop solar), in spite of their rich renewable resources. Within the east coast National Electricity Market both coal and gas generation fell in absolute terms in 2018 relative to the prior year. Gas suffered a particularly big fall, dropping by 26% on the prior year. Wind and solar by contrast experienced substantial growth. Wind generation was up in the NEM by 26%, while solar was up by 35%. Hydro generation was also up substantially by 29%, however this represents more of a cyclical, short-term phenomenon. Figure 1 – Change in levels of power generation by fuel in 2018 compared to 2017 for NEM Source: Green Energy Markets Renewable Energy Index analysis of AEMO data via NEMreview and LGC and STC registry data Extending our gaze back several years helps to illustrate the breakthrough renewable energy achieved in 2018. Figure 2 shows the change in generation in one year relative to its prior year. For wind there was a remarkable turnaround in 2018 after almost no growth in 2017 (which was a legacy of the Abbott-induced investment drought over 2014 and 2015). Rooftop solar has been steadily growing generation year on year but 2018 saw a big leap up, 86% greater than the average additions of 2015-2017. Yet it was large scale solar farms that really jumped out of the blocks in 2018 with generation leaping up by almost 300% on the prior year. It passed the 1,000GWh mark over the year although it remains small at present, but with a far bigger impact to be seen this year and next as thousands of megawatts under construction come online. The chart also shows how hydro tends to see-saw quite dramatically and 2018 happened to be an up year. However, given just how much wind and solar capacity will come online over 2019, hydro could have a down year and overall renewables will still grow its market share. Figure 2 Change in electricity generation year on year for renewable fuels in NEM Note this illustrates the change in generations levels for each year relative to levels in the prior year so the light yellow bar marked ‘2015’ shows the increase or decrease in generation levels in 2015 compared to what they were in 2014 for the respective fuel. Source: Green Energy Markets Renewable Energy Index analysis of AEMO data via NEMreview and LGC and STC registry data While 2018 was promising for renewable energy, the overall task of decarbonising the grid remains substantial. Figure 3 shows the cumulative change in generation levels by fuel type relative to 2014. While wind, solar and bioenergy generation has grown substantially since 2014, coal generation levels still remain above 2014 levels (albeit just slightly now). This is quite remarkable when you consider that Northern , Anglesea and Hazelwood Coal Power Stations closed over this period. In 2015 coal generators realised a large jump in generation levels driven more by the start up of Gladstone’s LNG plants than the abolition of the carbon price. These new LNG plants delivered a double windfall to coal of much more expensive gas and extra electricity demand (the LNG industry is a major consumer of electricity). Renewables growth has only just last year managed to whittle away much of coal’s gains made in 2015. Meanwhile gas & oil, after recovering generation levels somewhat in 2017 thanks to Hazelwood’s closure, were pushed down to their lowest levels since the abolition of the carbon price. Figure 3 – Cumulative change in generation levels by fuel relative to 2014 levels Source: Green Energy Markets analysis of AEMO data via NEMreview and LGC and STC registry data Figure 4 puts this into overall perspective looking at absolute levels of generation rather than levels of change. It shows that while brown coal and gas have declined, black coal has been chalking up significant growth in generation levels since 2014 which only flatlined in 2018. Figure 4 Renewable energy power generation relative to other fossil fuels since 2014 in the NEM Source: Green Energy Markets Renewable Energy Index analysis of AEMO data via NEMreview and LGC and STC registry data Looking forward though, black coal will see some noticeable declines in 2019. While large-scale solar farms were pretty small beer in the NEM in 2018 generating 1,850GWh, next year we expect their generation to lift to around 8,000GWh. While wind recorded a big lift in generation levels in 2018 relative to prior years, it will add double that amount of generation in 2019. Wind farms already under construction or contracted will add the same amount extra in 2020. Then we can add onto this a full year’s impact from the 1600MW of small-scale rooftop solar installed over 2018 and plenty more progressively added to the grid over 2019. This means not just gas and brown coal, but also black coal power plants will see their generation suffer significant falls in 2019, with the only bright side for fossil fuels being less hydro generation from Snowy, whose storages have run low over 2018. ————- About our Guest Author Tristan Edis is the Director – Analysis & Advisory at Green Energy Markets .

    "title": "Two points about the high demand & prices, and the load shedding, on Friday 25th January 2019",
    "date": "06-02-2019 03:51:00 PM",
    "content": "I was away at the time so did not post on the day (though I was able to post this review late the night before, of what happened on Thursday 24th January ). Last week I posted these follow-on thoughts . Here’s two quick notes that I will refer back to later… (1) Cumulative Price Threshold was reached for Victoria and South Australia In my post late on Thursday , I noted how it was likely that the Cumulative Price Threshold would be reached for both Victoria and South Australia the following day. As expected, this did turn out as expected – as a result of which spot prices were capped in South Australia and Victoria to a maximum of $300/MWh until Friday last week (1st February), as the Cumulative Price progressively wound down. Here’s a view of what happened taken from within one of the windows within NEMwatch v10: Because these instances are rare (and I will refer to them later) I have included a note in this post about it. (2) Using “Forecast Convergence” to delve into two factors that contributed to the load shedding This week I’ve fielded a few calls about two related things – about what happened on 25th January, and also about how we might use some of the functionality within our ez2view software to explore what happened (and particularly the “Forecast Convergence” widget). Readers should be very clear that this is not intended to be anywhere near a comprehensive list , but merely to flag two of the contributing factors that were highlighted in this 7:30 Report Special “Off The Grid” which aired on 30th January 2019 . 2a) Aggregate production from wind generation in Victoria dropped unexpectedly Here’s a view of two widgets together in a window in ez2view , Time-Traveled back to the 12:45 dispatch interval on Friday 25th January, which was under 2 hours after load shedding had started. This highlights one of the other challenges faced by AEMO on the day. In the 7:30 Report story (at about 2:44 minutes in) Audrey Zibelman notes that the wind dropped markedly through the day in Victoria, and that what was perhaps more challenging was that this drop was not seen in their earlier forecasts . With “Forecast Convergence” widget in ez2view , we can look at what the successive forecasts published by AEMO showe d. In this case, we are looking at successive half-hourly forecast for supply from aggregate intermittent generation plant in the region (mostly Wind, but also an increasing number of Large-Scale Solar plant). Click on the image for a full-screen view: For those who have not seen this widget before, I’ve annotated in some detail to (hopefully) make it clearer. Through the period were Load Shedding was operating, we see that both : 1) The aggregate production from intermittent generation dropped by something like 350MW over the period ; and 2) That this was not expected in the immediately preceding forecasts. It would be the combination of both factors that would have been particularly challenging . 2b) Second unit offline at Yallourn on Friday 25th January I missed it on my note on Thursday evening , but picked it up here last week , but there was a second unit at Yallourn removed from the market late on Thursday evening due to a tube leak. Note that I have put this one second in the list not because it has less significance than the first, but because I hope (having annotated the structure of “Forecast Convergence” above) that readers can follow a “zoomed out” view where you are unable to read the numbers, except via mouse-over. Very sad that I am very cognizant of conspiracy theories at both ends of the Emotion-o-meter ! In this view of “Forecast Convergence” I am showing successive views of the aggregate Available Generation capacity at the Yallourn station (not so much forecast but stated plans at the time by the operator of the station) – where, in this case, red colours indicate lower levels (i.e. greater risk to security of supply). I have also Time-Traveled back to the 01:00 dispatch interval on the morning of Friday 25th January to highlight what evolved through the day. Again, click on the image for a full-screen view: In summary, my first reading of this data suggests that the operator (EnergyAustralia) knew they had a problem with unit 3 (a tube leak), and that they were trying to “limp it through” as long as possible in order to support AEMO with the very tight supply/demand balance through Thursday. However it appears to have reached the point on Thursday morning where they knew they needed to take the plant out from 23:05 on Thursday night into Friday morning. The size of the reduction in available supply from Yallourn Station was 300MW . Coincidentally, in this case, the effect of the two factors was similar in both cases (in aggregate level) – though obviously the specifics were different: The whole of the 300MW reduction from Yallourn unit 3 was off for the whole day on Friday – but was telegraphed in advance from Thursday morning. Whereas the loss of supply from wind was shorter-term in nature, but also not forecast in advance. Both were contributing factors (two amongst many!), and each had their own challenges…. ————– As always, any errors in putting this quick post together are entirely my fault. … now back to the number crunching and analysis for the Generator Report Card 2018 .",

    "title": "The north Queensland deluge cuts solar production",
    "date": "04-02-2019 10:57:00 AM",
    "content": "This morning we were greeted with the updates in Townsville Bulletin , the Courier Mail , and elsewhere about the flooding event (and ongoing rain) in northern Queensland. Our main concern is for the safety and livelihood of friends, clients and others in the area at this stressful time. However I did wonder what effect an event like this might have on the level of energy generation from weather affected plant across northern Queensland, so had a quick look with our NEMreview v7 online application to produce this aggregated trend since the start of the year: With the benefit of the rainfall data we’ve collected from the BOM and are passing through to NEMreview v7, we can see the marked uplift in rainfall measurements for a few sample locations in northern Queensland. It looks like rainfall peaked around Cairns early in 27th January, but that Townsville has copped it since that time. 1) Aggregate solar production reduced by 2/3 into the 8th day We see in the chart above that the output has been fairly consistently reduced from a prior peak on prior days (of above 450MW) down to a level around 150MW – or a 300MW reduction. 1a) Solar Farms in Northern Queensland There are 10 x solar farms included in the aggregation above – Ross River, Sun Metals, Clare, Kidston, Daydream, Hayman, Hamilton, Whitsunday, Collinsville and Hughenden (with Rugby Run not yet operational). These are currently operational across Ross (i.e. Townsville) and North (i.e. Mackay) zones, with none yet in Far North zone (centred around Cairns). I’m not going to go through each individually, but should note the following in particular: (i) Ross zone solar farms majorly affected With Townsville being the focal point of the weather currently, it’s no surprise that the solar farms most affected are those in the Ross zone. 1) Ross River Solar Farm has also seen major impact – with a reduction of about 100MW of the 300MW total. 2) Sun Metals Solar Farm has been reduced to very low output over this 7+ day period (particularly 30th, 31st, 1st and 2nd). This has represented almost 100MW of the approx 300MW aggregate decline above. 3) Located just south of Townsville, Clare Solar Farm output has also been slashed – and has completely come offline (i.e. unavailable) since the 29th January. Rebid reasons say “Shutdown heavy rain”. That’s another 100MW. 4) Kidston Solar Farm output seems much less affected. (ii) North zone solar farms less affected – but smaller Looking at the North zone solar farms in descending order of registered capacity, we see much less impact on solar production: 1) Daydream Solar Farm output capability has increased in the past couple days, with what looks to be an increase in commissioning limits from 37.5MW to 75MW. However the output has barely hit those levels (perhaps due to cloud cover). 2) Hayman Solar Farm shown no output for a number of days – but perhaps due to commissioning. 3) The Hamilton Solar Farm has seen output drop. 4) The Whitsunday Solar Farm has seen output drop. 5) The Collinsville Solar Farm has seemed less affected (though still not full output) 6) It may be a coincidence to do with commissioning (have not checked further) but I did note that output from Hughenden has picked up from 2MW to 9MW in recent days. Obviously too small to impact on the aggregate number above. 7) Rugby Run Solar Farm not operational, as noted above. 1b) Central and Southern Queensland Not included in the aggregate above are some other solar farms in central and southern Queensland. (i) In central Queensland, solar farm output dampened Even further south in central-west Queensland, we also see an impact: 1) We see that both Barcaldine and Longreach solar farms are also down 50% of so from what would seem to be fairly widespread cloud/rain cover. 2) Output at Emerald did drop earlier in that period (28th through 31st) but is back up now. (ii) In southern Queensland, There’s not much in the way of large solar further south yet. 1) Childers is registered, but showing no output. 2) Susan River is currently sporadic – however the little data there is seems to show that it’s unaffected by the weather pattern. 3) Darling Downs Solar Farm has been running with high output. 4) The Oakey plant are not operational yet – I would imagine still recovering from their own weather-related damage from that hail/wind storm a while back. 2) Wind production Currently we have a statistical sample of only 1 wind farm in northern Queensland for which we have data, so note the usual disclaimers about what that means in drawing conclusions. This is Mt Emerald Wind Farm, located in the Far North zone. However it is worth highlighting that this particular wind farm is also becalmed over the past 7 days, coincident with the drop in solar production in the Ross zone to the south. Is that purely a coincidence – or is it related to the same weather pattern that’s brought all the rainfall (and suppressed solar production)? 3) Hydro production maxed out We also see how aggregate Hydro production is maxed out at 150MW following the move from Barron Gorge to full continuous output over the past week or so. Hypothetically speaking (and notwithstanding possible downstream effects, like flooding) I imagine that any available hydro capacity in northern Queensland (if built) would be running well under the current circumstances? ————- In this increasingly weather-dependent energy sector we’re moving into with these transitions, real case studies like these will need to be taken into account such that we have sufficient diversity to have robust security of supply.",

    "title": "Looking backwards over the past 2 weeks in the NEM",
    "date": "30-01-2019 08:04:00 AM",
    "content": "I’m back at work after a couple weeks off, and (apart from wading through all the follow-ups required given all the events of late last week in the hope of returning my attention to our Generator Report Card 2018 ), curiosity is getting the better of me about what happened whilst I was somewhat disconnected from the NEM. Hence I will post some notes here today, and then (if time permits) follow up with more later. Readers should also keep in mind that I was able to have this first peek at the end of Thursday 24th January . Each of the three charts provided below have been developed with our NEMreview v7 software product : (A) A view across the whole of the NEM Starting at the top and working in, I have trended the supply and demand balance on a NEM-wide basis from Monday 14th January: With respect to the chart above, there are a number of observations I’d like to make: Observation #1) Starting from the macro and working our way in is a good way of ensuring that we retain some perspective in terms of what’s going on. Observation #2) Included on the chart are three different measures that the AEMO uses for demand, aggregated to NEM-wide (TOTAL DEMAND, DEMAND and NON-SCHED GEN, and OPERATIONAL DEMAND). 2a) Note that they are different – hence readers should be aware of which measure is being used at different times. 2b) See the gory details about aspects of demand measurement here . 2c) A key point is that the demand peaked above 33,000MW on 5 separate days over this date range (by all 3 measures) – which is somewhat remarkable given that this was before the end of school holidays hence without the additional consumption inherent in the education system and the complementary additional consumption that will come from the end of the parent’s holiday, including mine. 2d) That level is still >2,000MW off the all-time record set back in January 2009 – however the intervening 10 year period has seen significant decline in demand for various reasons . Observation #3) I’ve noted on this chart how prices will almost never spike when IRPM (Instantaneous Reserve Plant Margin) is high – but won’t necessarily spike when IRPM is low. Hence it is an important non-price indicator of the balance between supply and demand , and possible use of market power: 3a) I moved this metric to real time more than a decade ago to include in an earlier version of NEMwatch (and it’s been included since that time). RPM has been used in the electricity sector beforehand – but moreso in a forward planning sense. 3b) It’s calculated as the excess of Available Generation over Demand 3c) Important to note that it can’t be calculated with measures of Demand that include Non-Scheduled Generation, as the level of Available Generation for those technology types is not accessible to, or published by, the AEMO. Hence it is still calculated with Scheduled Demand (i.e. TOTAL DEMAND). Observation #4) Most importantly, we know that Thursday 24th and Friday 25th January were particularly critica l for the NEM in a number of different ways (sustained high prices, load shedding, Reserve Trader and so on). 4a) However at a macro level we see that there were days in the week prior where the underlying situation NEM-wide was quite similar (e.g. 15th and 17th January): (i) Similar levels of demand (above 33,000MW on 5 days in the range above), (ii) Similar levels of available generation, and (iii) Similar level of IRPM (below 20% on Thu 24th and Fri 25th – but also on other days as well) – all NEM-wide. 4b) This is a timely reminder that local circumstances, and constraints, are critical to market outcomes – not just down at a regional level, but also within regions down to individual zones as well. Transmission congestion, the local nuances of weather patterns, and generator outage rates all played a key role in making Thursday and Friday quite different than a week prior. This is something that should be kept in mind when considering both: (i) operational decisions (e.g. what might happen this week and next); but also (ii) strategic decisions as well – such as: Case 1 = for business developers seeking in invest considerable funds (whether theirs or others) in the construction of new generation assets, whatever the type. Case 2 = more broadly, for those completing, promoting, or just using the growing number of strategic planning studies (including 100% renewables studies). Does your modelling correctly account for the nature of transmission congestion, do you take due care in modelling a significant number of plausible weather scenarios, and are you running monte-carlo simulations on generator outage patterns – or are these critical considerations that all just waved away by some magic wand (and hence becoming an unwitting victim of Villain no 4 ) ? Now that we have started with the NEM-wide perspective, we’ll drill in a little more. (B) A view for Victoria Here’s a similar 2-week view for the Victorian region: Standing out across the two-week period are the two days in question – Thursday 24th and Friday 25th January: Observation #5) We see that Victorian demand (all three measures) rose above 9,000MW on both of those days – considerably higher than any other day shown in this period. However readers should remember that this was still more than 1,000MW below the all-time maximum (10,496MW in Victoria for TOTAL DEMAND, as shown in NEMwatch – though this was achieved in January 2009 , well prior to the closure of Hazelwood). Observation #6) I’d also draw particular attention to the much higher temperature in Morwell on Friday 25th compared to Thursday 24th. As a reasonable representation of the ambient temperatures that the Latrobe Valley gas and coal power stations would have seen, one would have expected to see maximum capabilities more affected on Friday than on Thursday. Observation #7) I have not marked it on the chart as it is already busy, but it’s worth flagging how 300MW of capacity at Yallourn unit 3 was removed from the market from 23:05 on Thursday 24th January due to a tube leak, and that this was one of the major reasons why there was load shedding required on Friday whilst not on Thursday: 7a) I missed this in my update late on Thursday evening last week as I’d time-traveled those particular widgets to 21:00 in order to provide focus on Thursday’s activity. 7b) In our our Generator Report Card 2018 we’re having a detailed look for each generator individually at their reliability patterns . To what extent are they seasonal, and how are they trending over time (particularly how quickly are they getting worse, if that is the case). Observation #8) The demand shape for Friday 25th January is much “choppier” than for the other days, which seems to me to be due (at least in part) to the unnatural effect of the load shedding enforced onto Victorian consumers (small and large). (C) A view for South Australia Finally in this post we include a similar view for South Australia: Adding to the list above we see: Observation #9) That the differences between the various measures of demand in the South Australia can be particularly pronounced – following on from Observation #2 above: 9a) This tweet on Thursday 24th January at 18:07 NEM time captured a time when Operational Demand was well up in the red zone for the South Australian region (via our ECA-sponsored Electricity Consumption widget ) – quite close to the all-time record, despite the demand response operating via RERT and also via more general spot-exposure . 9b) However Scheduled Demand barely scraped over 3,000MW – meaning it was 400MW or so off the all-time record via that measure, set in January 2011. Observation #10) Unfortunately (though perhaps not unexpectedly, as it is a recurring pattern) we see that wind output dropped substantially at the time of peak pricing: 10a) In much the same way that Scheduled generators shifting volume to higher-priced bid bands ( shown for Loy Yang here , and discussed on other sites), this physical withdrawal of capacity due to energy constraints also has a major effect on increasing the spot price. 10b) This has double-whammy effect – not only is wind significantly hobbled as a supply option, but the removal of the cooling effect of the wind leads to higher demand (to stretch further other supplies); 10c) This has become particularly expected in South Australia, which is part of the reason describe this as a “ wind correlation penalty ” ; 10d) What this means is that wind farm operators in South Australia earn significantly lower volume-weighted average spot revenue than other types of plant: (i) I can understand how investors in generation infrastructure (particularly foreign investors looking at new assets) might be particularly keen to understand the extent to which generators have missed revenue opportunities as a result of siting decisions made at project commencement. (ii) In our Generator Report Card 2018 we are taking a closer look at what this has been for every single generator , and how this is trending over time – e.g. is the spread getting worse over time? ——————— That’s all for now, folks, but perhaps more later as time permits (though I really should be focused on our Generator Report Card 2018 and other promises for clients).",

    "date": "25-01-2019 03:28:00 AM",
    "content": "I’ve been on holidays the past couple weeks – this year keen to escape the NEM (and fortuitously most of the summer heat). Apart from some initial analysis in preparation for our collaboratively developed Generator Report Card 2018 , which I knew I had to get underway, I’ve been largely successful at that. However I could not escape the ongoing stream of SMS alert messages and phone calls that inundated me all through this past afternoon (Thursday 24th January) as Victoria and South Australia boiled for hours. A small sacrifice to pay compared to those stressed out with keeping the lights on, exposed to high spot prices but perhaps unable to curtail – or just baking in the heat. Hence with my day largely finished now (and the buzzing phone finally abated) I thought it might be useful to some readers if I took a first * look at a number of events that occurred through the day: * Readers should note that this first look may well contain errors, misinterpretations and omissions. I’d ask that you keep this in mind in your reading. Upon my return (next week) I hope to have a bit more time to dig deeper. If you have comments on what follows, please feel free to leave a comment or send an email – but leave the phone calls till next week please . (A) First look at Thursday 24th January 2019 During the afternoon as the result of a team effort, we were able to post this initial article highlighting some of the aspects of what was going on through the day. (A1) Prices The SMS alerts had been trickling in beforehand, but these were more about forecast shortages. However from 15:25 (first major spike for VIC and SA) it became a torrent over 66 dispatch intervals up near the Market Price Cap in both Victoria and South Australia ( 5-and-a-half-hours ) until 21:00, when the price finally dropped. Here’s a snapshot taken from my copy of NEMwatch later in the evening: A less well known aspect of the NEM is the working of the Cumulative Price , which is also shown in NEMwatch (and was the subject of one of the questions received today). This is the rolling total of 7 days of trading prices, and operates as a safety valve on the market in terms of liquidity risk for wholesale market customers because of their prudential requirements. Here’s a view of how this trended upwards through the day: We see that the Cumulative Price climbed up close to $205,000 to the current point in time, and is continuing to climb slowly as the lower prices periods from a week ago roll out of the rolling total. It’s when the Cumulative Price Reaches the Cumulative Price Threshold that the AEMO steps in to cap prices. This document from the AEMO notes that the Cumulative Price Threshold for 2018-19 financial year is $216,900 . It’s a number I find hard to remember – so the shorthand I use is that it’s roughly the Market Price Cap x 15. What’s important to note is that the Cumulative Price currently is only $10,000 below that – hence it would not take even one half hour at MPC tomorrow to set it over its limit . My recollection is that there have only been 5 instances where the Cumulative Price Threshold has been reached in the entire history of the NEM: (a) Once in Victoria ( January 2009 ); (b) Three times in South Australia ( March 2008 , January 2009 and November 2009 ); and (c) Once in Tasmania (at June 2009 ) During some of these periods, we’ve observed a number of strange behaviours in the past (like spot-exposed, and curtailed, demand response actually coming back online with the price drop, despite the ongoing tight supply/demand balance at the time this happened). It will be important to watch this tomorrow, as it may play a role in delivering less demand response than would otherwise be the case, if spot prices are artificially constrained down at $300/MWh because the Cumulative Price Threshold has been reached . (A2) Temperatures and demand Even where I am, it’s hit the mainstream media that the temperature experienced in Adelaide today (46.6 degrees Celsius) was the highest ever experienced for an Australian capital city. I daresay there are not many major cities around the world that would have ever been that well baked. Earlier today on Twitter , the team posted this snapshot from the Energy Consumer’s Australia NEMwatch widget : We were pleased to work with our sponsors ( the ECA ) to provide this widget as a freely available point of information on the way temperature drives electricity consumption , with no better example of it than what we saw today in this snapshot. The red colour of the South Australian region highlights how high its demand was based on its historical range (only 100MW below the all-time record, when measured on the same basis – as noted in the tweet). Logging into the online component of ez2view and accessing a number of previously configured trends, I have included the following trended views of how temperatures drove demand during the day: (i) Trended demand NEM-wide Firstly, given that Ilan had posted about how Scheduled Demand rose above 33,000MW NEM-wide on Tuesday , I have zoomed into our 14-day NEM-wide view (7-days backwards and 7-days forwards, which clients can access here ) to compare between Tuesday and Thursday on a NEM-wide basis: On Thursday we see how the Scheduled Demand* peaked up at 33,150MW at 17:00 in the afternoon – and note that this will have occurred with demand curtailed : after Reserve Trader had operated, which will itself have come after a number of spot-exposed, demand response enabled energy users we serve in both VIC and SA had reduced their consumption when prices first started going ballistic. Given how demand has been declining from about 2009 (when the all-time maximum was experienced ) for a variety of reasons , that’s a pretty remarkable demand level in its own right (albeit still more than 1,000MW below the all-time max). * Some might be interested in this explainer of some of the gory details of measurement of demand , and what is meant by Scheduled Demand, Operational Demand and so on… (ii) Trended temperature and demand for South Australia Turning our attention to South Australia, I have zoomed into our 14-day NEM-wide view (7-days backwards and 7-days forwards, which clients can access here ) to take a look over recent days: The temperatures plotted on this trend are hourly average temperatures for Mt Gambier, Adelaide and Whyalla. We see some high temperatures in Adelaide, and positively horrid temperatures for Whyalla. Still reaching about 35, Mt Gambier seems positively mild in comparison. We see demand peaking at 3,273 at the “Demand and Non-Sched Gen” approximation for Operational Demand (slightly lower than shown above for the ECA widget, due to different data set used). Unfortunately we also see a significant loss of supply from aggregate wind generation that comes before both the sustained price spikes (800MW lost before spikes) and the peak in demand (>1,000MW lost prior to peak demand). Using Forecast Convergence widget in the ez2view installed application to look back over successive AEMO forecasts for this Wind and Solar contribution, we see that the wind production levels, though considerably lower than earlier that day, were slightly better than what the AEMO had expected them to be. Using the same function and flipping to Scheduled Demand in South Australia, we see that the actual levels of Scheduled Demand experienced were slightly lower than forecast: This will have been partly to do with the slightly higher contribution from wind than forecast immediately beforehand. (iii) Trended temperature and demand for Victoria Completing this picture by looking at Victoria (here’s similar client access ) we see the following trimmed view: As noted on the image, we see that the “Demand and Non-Sched Gen” approximation for Operational Demand peaked up at 9,387MW at 17:55. Using Forecast Convergence widget in the ez2view installed application to look back over successive AEMO forecasts for Scheduled Demand, we see that in this case the AEMO had considerable difficulty in forecasting the level of demand, which surprised on the upside (from people on the ground in Victoria the suggestion is that this was in part due to the higher level of humidity than normally experienced) . As noted in the image, the forecast for Friday afternoon was upgraded on Thursday evening (coincident with AEMO experiencing higher-than-expected demand for Thursday afternoon). (A3) Constraints Every dispatch interval there are typically 600-800 constraint equations “invoked”, or used by AEMO via NEMDE to keep the system operating within physical limits. With ez2view, you can see all of them. In this article I want to just highlight one constraint equation – N^^V_NIL_1 – which had the effect of limiting the capability of the NSW-VIC interconnector to supply surplus power from QLD+NSW into a very tight VIC+SA Economic Island: As a result, VIC+SA (and a bit of Tassie exports) was all on its own –> hence talk about an outage at Liddell seems a bit of a red herring on this occasion. If I had more time, I would look further – but not at the present time… (A4) Dispatch When there is more time, I will be very interested to investigate further, but just wanted to flag a few interesting points of dispatch in AEMO’s job today of keeping the lights on. (i) Dispatch of LOR3 Load Shedding A market notice (#66670) issued at 16:14 signalled that load shedding had begun at 16:10 for an estimated maximum amount of 266MW in the Victorian region. I read somewhere that this was just Alcoa’s Portland smelter that was instructed to shed load but have not had time to look into that (coincidentally I know of residential customers that did lose supply in Melbourne – though this might just be coincidence). A market notice (#666708) issued at 20:00 indicated the end of Load Shedding. (ii) Dispatch of Reserve Trader Separate from the load shedding, other loads were actually asked to turn off as one form of demand response under the “Reserve Trader” arrangement as noted in the earlier article during the afternoon . This notice was published at 14:24 and related to dispatch from 16:30. I have not seen further information in a quick scan about this. (iii) Other demand response Worth a quick note about other demand response (including clients of ours in both VIC and SA) who would have almost certainly triggered curtailment earlier that afternoon in response to the high prices when they started to roll through – though ( as noted before ) it’s impossible to know exactly how much, because of the nature of their arrangements. (iv) Drop in aggregate wind output across VIC and SA In images above, I’ve noted the unfortunate drop in wind output in South Australia prior to the price spikes, and also how the later ramp-up of wind output in Victoria unfortunately also missed the timing of peak demand and price. (v) Loy Yang A unit out down by 600MW+ compared to earlier in the week Using a standard widget within ez2view (that is copied below for different stations for expediency) we see that not only does Loy Yang A have Unit 3 out this week for tube leak, but we also see output at Unit 2 reduced from 530MW to 400MW earlier in the day for reasons I have not explored: If time permits, I would explore further. (vi) Yallourn has a unit out on maintenance Noted elsewhere there is a unit out on maintenance – however no image provided here as output for the other 3 units pretty consistent over the past couple days. PS on Monday 29th January In delving a bit further for this article here, I noticed that Yallourn Unit 3 came offline from 23:05 on Thursday 24th January. This was later than the Time-Traveled window used for these station-level charts included here (set at 21:00 to keep focus on Thursday), which is why I missed it last week. (vii) Loy Yang B reduction between 14:00 and 16:00 In this chart here, we see output reduced between 14:00-16:00 (roughly), for unknown reasons: (viii) Murray cranks up We see Murray output during the day much higher than was the case in prior days: (ix) Mortlake running hard I’ve not got time to add in all the gas peakers (there were many running) but have added in Mortlake here: (x) Torrens Island Station (both A & B) Here’s a view of all 8 units at Torrens Island, cranked up to the maximum capability: (x) Macarthur Wind Farm: Being (I think still?) the biggest wind farm operational by installed capacity, I have added in Macarthur for a particular look: Over the four days shown, we see its output peaks at 13:40 during the afternoon – but then declines 200MW during the same period when the price spike is in place. (xi) Hornsdale Battery Exporting Here’s a quick look at exports from Hornsdale battery: Worth noting that the output from the battery ceased at 18:25 (i.e. with the price spike still having a couple hours to run) – which I presume was as a result of low state of charge. Also worth noting that output did not increase over the 30MW “market” component. (xii) SA Emergency Generators Both the emergency generators saw some run time: (B) Brief look at current expectations for Friday 25th January 2019 That’s all I have time for right now. Looking into the day to come, we see more LOR notices: Currently forecast LOR3 for Victoria from 12:00 to 15:00 with maximum load shedding 186MW (Market Notice #66714) A LOR2 forecast for Tasmania between 13:30 and 15:00 (Market Notice #66727) I’m getting back to my holiday, and will pick this up further next week…",

    "title": "NEM spot prices remained stubbornly high in 2018 – what were the drivers?",
    "date": "11-01-2019 09:08:00 AM",
    "content": "The surge in NEM spot prices since 2015, and related impacts on contract and retail prices, have been extensively discussed and analysed in many forums, from ACCC inquiries to Twitter. The underlying reasons for the rise are well understood and centre on reductions in available supply – retirement of some largeish, low marginal cost generation – and the increased cost of gas. However since the retirement of Hazelwood in early Q2 2017, we’ve seen significant additions to supply with an accelerating wave of investment in renewable generation, both large scale and small, with a good part of that investment helped by the rise in market prices – which is the way markets generally work: higher prices stimulating increased supply. We can see the impacts of these retirements and increased renewables capacity in the final year of this long-term chart showing relative shares generated from the NEM’s different primary energy sources: To show in more detail the evolving supply mix since Hazelwood retired we can look at changes in rolling annual energy output by generation energy source. I like the rolling annual view – which at each point in time captures the total energy generated over the immediately preceding 365 days, plotted as the difference from generation over the 365 days prior to the start of the chart – because this smooths out seasonal or short term factors which can impact (say) quarterly changes in supply mix. It also captures movements in generation levels throughout the period, not just the net change between start and end dates: The chart clearly shows Hazelwood’s closure reducing annualised generation from brown coal, which at the end of March 2018 had fallen by 10 TWh, a typical year’s output from Hazelwood. Brown coal generation levels have been largely steady since. Also clear is that over 2017, the gap left by Hazelwood was filled almost entirely by increased output from other fossil fuel sources – black coal and natural gas. These sources also had to cover a significant reduction in hydro generation, especially sharp in Q4 2017. This reduction seems a little surprising but arose because in 2016 hydro generators, particularly Snowy Hydro, generated at high levels, then reduced output in 2017 in order to conserve or rebuild water storage levels. Wind generation also fell slightly in 2017, with a very weak Q2 due to unusually still weather patterns . The modest growth in solar output through 2017 largely reflected ongoing installation of small scale rooftop PV systems. Over 2018 the picture changes, with a lift in energy generated from renewable sources, including a clear acceleration in solar output over the last six months as a raft of new utility-scale solar farms have been commissioned and very strong growth in rooftop PV. Gas-fired generation reduced sharply back to pre-Hazelwood closure levels. Hydro generation returned to the higher levels seen in 2016. Given these shifts, it’s a bit surprising that after some retreat from the highs of early 2017, spot prices in 2018 have not been driven any lower as low marginal cost renewables replace output from higher cost gas generation. In fact 2018 has seen a generally rising trend in underlying spot prices even as growth in renewable output has accelerated. Quarterly NEM prices since 2015 are summarised in the following chart: Spot prices in this chart are demand-weighted averages over the NEM’s five regions, separated into “underlying” and “volatility” components. The former is calculated by capping half hourly trading prices at $300/MWh prior to averaging, and the latter measures the residual contribution of half hourly prices in excess of $300/MWh to the overall average of uncapped prices. Volatility typically reflects the impact of a small number of half hours of extreme price up to the Market Price Cap (currently $14,500/MWh), while the underlying component captures the general level of spot prices across all half hours. Underlying averages declined through 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, with the uncapped averages being raised significantly by price volatility in Q1 2017 (principally in Queensland) and Q1 2018 (South Australia and Victoria). The chart also shows that underlying spot prices have risen through the rest of 2018, the largest rise being in Q4, despite the acceleration in renewables output. The rest of this post will dive a little deeper into the reasons for the elevation in underlying spot prices in Q4 2018, as it provides insights into the NEM’s pricing mechanisms and the impacts of participant behaviour. Let’s start with a quarterly view of changes in energy generated by source, comparing Q4 2018 with the previous quarter (Q3 2018) and also with Q4 in 2017: We can see in the left panel that between Q3 and Q4 2018, generation fell from sources other than solar and a small increase in black coal. Overall electricity demand in Q4 (which necessarily equals total generation) was, as usual, lower than in Q3. But it’s interesting that the largest declines in generation volumes came from sources which are potentially lower in marginal cost – wind, brown coal and hydro (where most of the decrease was due to Hydro Tasmania reducing its generation and exports to the mainland). In the right panel we see that relative to Q4 2017 demand was virtually flat, and that there was a 44% drop in gas-generated electricity, displaced by growth in solar, wind and hydro. There’s a mixed story here: relative to Q3 2018 the fall in supply from lower cost sources may partly explain why spot prices rose in Q4. But relative to Q4 2017 the large reduction in gas-fired generation and increased supply from lower-cost sources might have been expected to reduce spot prices – but instead they were well above their level a year ago. Additional insight comes from looking at gas prices. We don’t know the contract prices that gas fired generators pay for their fuel, but we can get a general indication of wholesale gas price movements from spot gas prices in AEMO’s Short Term Trading Markets in Brisbane, Adelaide and Sydney and the Victorian Declared Wholesale Gas Market: This shows a strong runup in 2016 and the first half of 2017, as Queensland’s LNG export terminals ramped towards full capacity, a dip in the second half of 2017 and then a steady increase to near-record levels in Q4 2018. This pattern broadly matches the behaviour of spot electricity prices over the last two years, reinforcing the role that gas-fired generation plays as a marginal price-setter in the NEM. For readers not fully familiar with how NEM spot prices are set, Paul McArdle has posted a couple of excellent educational pieces on this site, an overview of NEM dispatch and pricing , and an explainer on the motivation for marginal-pricing mechanisms like the NEM’s, contrasted with alternative models. Fundamental to marginally priced markets is that prices are set by the last supply or demand reduction offer dispatched in order to balance supply and demand, after (in principle) arranging the volumes offered in order of increasing price. So it is the pricing of offers that fall at around the total demand level on the cumulative bid stack that is critical, rather than the average level of pricing across all market offers. With the current supply-demand balance in the NEM, gas and hydro generators are frequently the marginal price setting plant: Data in this chart are derived from very detailed price-setting information published by AEMO for every five-minute dispatch interval. The key point is that although hydro and gas generators supply only about 15-20% of the NEM’s energy, their offers set over 50% of spot prices across NEM regions in the quarters shown. Conversely, solar, wind and brown coal generation which typically offer supply at much lower prices and generated over 30% of NEM energy in 2018 only rarely set the spot price. Further insight into these dynamics and a good illustration of why prices in Q4 2018 remained higher than those of a year ago can be gained from a snapshot comparison of the NEM’s supply offer stacks for a couple of representative half hours in December 2017 and December 2018 respectively. I’ve selected two afternoon half hours with very similar aggregate NEM demand levels for this comparison: The lower panel shows that despite there being significantly more low-cost supply offers in the Dec 2018 bidstack, an upward shift in the pricing of gas and hydro volumes meant that the marginal pricing level was actually somewhat higher than a year ago. Whilst this comparison picks out only one half hour from thousands in each quarter, it is still a good illustration of why we haven’t seen any sustained fall in spot prices just yet.

    "title": "A potentially extreme temperature forecast for Adelaide and Melbourne next week…",
    "date": "10-01-2019 02:20:00 PM",
    "content": "Paul McArdle wrote this article yesterday about the AEMO’s notice of possible extreme temperatures next week for Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney, so I decided to have a closer look, using data we have access to at MetraWeather. A key aspect of the forecasts for next week’s heat event is the large uncertainty that still surrounds these forecasts. While many forecasts predict temperatures to reach the mid-to-high 30s for Melbourne and low 40s for Adelaide, there are a significant handful of possible outcomes still on the table that could see both cities simultaneously exceeding 40 degrees, and in some circumstances by a significant amount. Take a look at the two scatterplots below, plotting all daily maximum temperatures from 1 January 1981 to 31 December 2018: (a) Above, we plot Melbourne vs. Bankstown. (b) Underneath, we have Adelaide vs. Melbourne. Also included on these scatterplots is a line called the Pareto Frontier . This line is one way of describing the highest combination of heat observed in the historical data. Anything above this line could arguably be called record heat, since: (a) it would either exceed the maximum value recorded at Location A and/or B, or (b) it would exceed the highest combination of heat ever seen with respect to similar combinations of heat. In other words, this line takes into consideration that extreme heat at one location can often limit the ability for another city extreme heat at the same time, and so sub-record values at both locations may still be unprecedented when viewed in combination. Looking first at the scatterplot at the top: Both Melbourne and Bankstown have risen into the low-to-mid 40s on several occasions since the 1980s. However, these two cities have difficulty in reaching extreme temperature values at the same time. The Pareto Frontier reflects this, as it carves away a large region of possible heat combinations. In fact, while both cities somewhat regularly exceeded the 40-degree mark, there is only one day in the 38-year dataset where Melbourne and Bankstown were both above the 40-degree mark at the same time : Black Saturday , (7 Feb 2009). Purposefully excluding this day from the Pareto Frontier line, it becomes obvious just how exceptional this heat event was for southeastern Australia. On the second scatterplot: Adelaide and Melbourne heat is more correlated to one another, and thus the Pareto Frontier carves away a much smaller corner of the plot. However, while both cities have reached above the 45-degree mark since 1981, it was never at the same time. Thus, if both locations were to hit 44 to 45 degrees simultaneously next week, neither would break their individual records, but it would be a new frontier of extreme heat. But the question bears asking: Is that kind of heat combination possible next week? Also shown on this graph are 51 equally-likely predictions of Adelaide and Melbourne’s maximum temperatures on Tuesday 15 January 2019 , as predicted by the 51 individual model members of the ECMWF Ensemble model. While Monday is expected to see hot temperatures, the most extreme solutions are focussed on Tuesday . Looking at these 51 forecasts, there are a few that suggest record heat for Adelaide or Melbourne. There are also several that approach the Pareto Frontier line, which would imply Melbourne-Adelaide combination heat that would be nearly unprecedented. While we may not necessarily see a record broken at either individual location, there is a significant chance that near-record conditions could occur when considering the two locations as a pair. Lastly, here is the same scatterplot for the combination of Adelaide and Bankstown. Somewhat counterintuitively, Sydney heat actually has a stronger correlation with Adelaide heat than with Melbourne. While the Sydney region is expected to see hot temperatures through the mid-week, the most strenuous temperatures are expected to be in Adelaide and Melbourne, both individually and in combination.

    "title": "Hot weather forecast to drive demand past 31,000MW next Tuesday 15th January",
    "date": "09-01-2019 11:05:00 AM",
    "content": "A quick note today, to highlight the Market Notice alert that we’ve received in our NEMwatch (entry level) and ez2view (higher end) software dashboard packages: What stands out to me is the forecasts for both Tuesday and Wednesday next week, where hot weather is forecast for both Adelaide and Sydney on the same days. Without the time to pull up historical data to confirm, I’d just note that this strikes me as possibly relatively rare based on the general sense developed watching the NEM, and the weather patterns that increasingly drive it, over the years. Some of our more know knowledgeable readers (particularly those who are meteorologists) might want to comment? PS – thanks Rob Davis for adding your own insights in this post on Thursday here . Intrigued by what that might mean for demand forecast, and understanding that Tuesday (but not yet Wednesday) is covered in the ST PASA time horizon, I opened the pre-prepared online trend in ez2view online ( clients can access their own copy here to watch this unfold ) and see that AEMO is currently forecasting a peak in Scheduled* Demand above 31,000MW at 17:00 on Tuesday 15th January , with forecast for Operational* Demand up near 31,500MW: * Readers can delve into the gory details of all the different definitions of demand in this prior explainer here – Scheduled, Operational and more . More complex than one might initially think, unfortunately… Readers should also be aware that a peak up above 31,000MW (for Scheduled Demand) would still be more than 4,000MW below this massive all-time demand peak reached almost exactly 10 years beforehand , back before all these factors started contributing to declining demand . I’d ordinarily say something like “I’ll be interested to see what unfolds” , and that would be true – however the next 2 weeks is time planned for a bit of R&R outside the NEM with not many thoughts about the NEM at all to intrude (save for the 1 job I can’t escape, which is to start delving into the large mass of data assembled this week for our Generator Report Card 2018 ).

    "title": "Extensive review of Units Off-Target, as part of Generator Report Card 2018",
    "date": "07-01-2019 06:55:00 AM",
    "content": "As noted last week, our number crunching has begun for the purposes of compiling our Generator Report Card 2018. Further information about the Report Card is provided online – including the chance to secure a discounted price when ordering before the report has been finalised. With the report card, we are focused on answering a long list of questions about various aspects of performance of all generators, no matter what flavour. (A) Is the AEMO’s job becoming more difficult? One of the headline questions we are curious to delve into is whether the AEMO’s job is becoming more difficult in dispatch of the market as the years progress and this energy transition continues? There are a number of different aspects of the challenge of balancing supply with demand from one dispatch interval to the next – one of these is the extent to which AEMO’s expectations of where each individual unit will land (at the end of each dispatch interval ) matches what actually happens. In simple terms, whether units are “Off-Target” . Whether or not units are Off-Target is something that can be measured for all Scheduled and Semi-Scheduled units, by comparing their Target values with the Initial MW values for the subsequent dispatch interval (i.e. their expected output with their actual). So we have calculate this for every dispatch interval, for every DUID in the entire history of the NEM (less a few dispatch intervals we’re missing from the start). It’s the same comparison that is the root of the AEMO’s “Aggregate Dispatch Error” calculation, however I was curious to look at the numbers a different way for the entire history of the NEM. Hence for this preliminary analysis, we have: Step 1 = calculated an “Off target” measure for every DUID in a given dispatch interval Step 2 = taken the absolute value of that Off Target “error” (i.e. some will be above 0MW and some are below 0MW, but we’re only interested in the scale at this point; and Step 3 = Aggregated the numbers up for every DUID in that DI up to derive a single measure for each Dispatch Interval. We call this “Aggregate Absolute Measure of Off-Target” . It’s probably not exactly what a formal statistician would define (they would probably prefer something like Root Mean Square Error ) but it’s useful enough for our purpose here. The three charts that have included here shows a trended distribution of a metric calculated for every single dispatch interval over the 20-year history of the NEM (minus a few orphan intervals in 1998): Chart 1) Low numbers In the first chart included here, we see that almost all DIs see an “Aggregate Absolute Off-Target” being more than 100MW, and that the incidence for the measure being above 200MW seems to be steadily increasing from the early years – with an aberration in the early years that has not been explored. I’ve noted on the chart a suspicion that this trended increase for >200MW might just be due (at least in part) to a growing number of DUIDs involved in the dispatch process. Chart 2) Mid-range numbers In the second chart, we see that “Aggregate Absolute Off-Target” appears choppier in the mid-range incidence levels. There appears a notable decline from around 2009 through to 2017 (perhaps linked to the decline in demand?) before a sharp spike upwards for 2018 (for reasons that have not been investigated). Chart 3) Low incidence and High “Error” numbers In the final chart, we look at the upper range of Aggregate OffTarget error: Each specific Dispatch Interval could be individually investigated (if we had enough time, which we clearly don’t). However out of curiosity I did track down the all-time high point being 10:50 on 2nd July 2009 – when a trip of all 4 x Bayswater units contributed over half of the total “error” of 4,031MW. In these charts there does not seem to be a clear pattern emerging (though there is a marked reversal of trend in 2018 for the mid-range incidences that we would investigate further if we had time). It might be that this has been due to the commissioning of many new solar farms in 2018 (i.e. whilst the ASEFS model is still being trained up to correctly forecast their output – however that’s entirely speculation on my part ). (B) Different reasons why generators might not follow their targets Readers (especially Villains no 3 shouting from either end of the Emotion-o-meter ) need to be very clear that there are several significant reasons why an individual generation unit might see an actual output vary from what the AEMO expects it will be, or tells it to be (in a dispatch target). In compiling our Generator Report Card 2018, we will be exploring all of the significant reasons – but for starters let’s just flag a few in no particular order: Reason B1) Units sometime trip Reminding readers of what guest author Hugh Saddler noted (that Unit Trips are normal occurrences, but system blackouts are not) we start with the fact that units occasionally trip. This can happen for a range of different reasons – and can happen for all plant types (though the larger the unit, the larger the single effect a trip will have on balancing supply and demand). As one example of a unit trip (of which we will find an increasing number more recently, if the #coalfail meme is to be believed) , here’s a short post about what happened with Mt Piper unit 2 in the 23:45 dispatch interval on 24th October 2018. In the preparation of our Generator Report Card 2018, we’re having a detailed look at what’s been happening with respect to unit trips (one form of units being Off-Target). Reason B2) Units sometimes fail to start The reverse can also happen sometimes – “fast start” units might be sent a dispatch target instructing them to start, but fail to start (for whatever reason). As an example of a unit that did not start , here’s a short post about what happened with Braemar A unit 3 on 29th August 2018 at 17:00. In the preparation of our Generator Report Card 2018, we’re having a detailed look at what’s been happening with respect to unit failing to start (another form of units being Off-Target). Reason B3) Sometimes forecast output of Semi-Scheduled units are not as good as we’d like them to be For the majority of time (different for different units, depending on the incidence of constraints – which we are also looking into ) Semi-Scheduled wind and solar plant don’t have to follow dispatch targets from the AEMO. On these occasions, they just produce what the sun or wind allows them to produce in that interval. That does not mean that the AEMO is not interested in having a good understanding about what the unit will be producing at the end of a dispatch interval. Currently, the responsibility for the forecasts rests with the AEMO’s AWEFS forecasting system (for wind) or ASEFS (for solar). As an example of forecast that appeared to prove more difficult than AEMO would have wanted, let’s look at this case for Macarthur Wind Farm on 11th August 2018 at 18:35. In the preparation of our Generator Report Card 2018, we’re having a detailed look at what’s been happening with respect to forecasts not being as accurate as desired (another form of units being Off-Target). We’re particularly interested to understand if: (a) Some Semi-Scheduled plants are more difficult to forecast than others; and (b) Whether there is any trend in the pattern (i.e. forecasts getting better, or worse). Reason B4) Sometimes Unit behaviours are questionable On occasions where the Semi-Dispatch Cap is flagged, the Semi-Scheduled plant are required to pay attention to the Dispatch Target they are assigned for that particular dispatch interval (as noted before, the “target” is strictly more like a “cap”). I’ve previously posted this article about a particular case on 24th July 2018 for Lake Bonney 2 and Lake Bonney 3 wind farms , both operated by Infigen Energy, where the wind farms appear to have ignored dispatch targets instructing them to increase and instead appear to have manually tripped the units in reaction to a negative price that they appear not to have liked. My sense is that this would have been to the consternation of both: (a) The AER, as it is responsible for ensuring all generator bids are not false or misleading; and (b) The AEMO, as it had set the request to increase outcome for system stability reasons in the south-east of South Australia. In the preparation of our Generator Report Card 2018 (and in the light of conversations with other new entrants who have been thinking of adopting what would seem to be a similar approach), we’re having a detailed look at this particular type of behaviour to see how many examples there are, by different portfolios. Here’s other samples that we flagged in our searching: Example 1 seems a very similar case at Lake Bonney 2 only a few weeks earlier on 7th July 2018, but Example 2 seems (based on further information provided by those associated with the plant) to further illustrate the difficulties of getting to the bottom of what happens-and-why when units are off-target based just on public data in the MMS. Reason B5) Supply of FCAS Services As further development work continued on the GRC2018 , we recognized that one reason we’d omitted from this initial list on 7th January is that a unit might be supplying FCAS services during that dispatch interval. In other words, a unit might have received a dispatch target to go from A to B over that 5-minute period – but, during the period received updated instructions to provide Raise or Lower Services for the FCAS as a result of which that the unit ends up at point C at the end of that dispatch interval (not B, as initially intended). In this case, a unit would still flag as being Off-Target in our query however this should not be misinterpreted as this unit making the AEMO’s job more difficult by not following instructions. —————- PS added Jan 2020 – note that, as part of our work in preparing the GSD2019, we refined the logic for calculating ‘Raw Off-Target’ to take account of any Raise/Lower Regulation Enablement levels that had been assigned to that DUID – hence (using this improved definition) it would not be possible for a unit to be ‘Off -Target’ as a result of FCAS Regulation Enablement. Other Reasons?) To be investigated further As time permits, we will be interested to delve deeper into the data to understand if there are other significant reasons why DUIDs might be missing their targets by large margins. Most importantly, we’re interested to understand if any of these reasons are becoming more pronounced or prolific.",

    "title": "[UPDATED] Off-Target #4 – Disregard Targets – Lake Bonney in July 2018 (and possibly others)",
    "date": "07-01-2019 06:51:00 AM",
    "content": "As part of the process of compiling our Generator Report Card 2018 , we’re taking a look at the instances where individual DUIDs were significantly Off-Target. In our longitudinal summary article today, we can’t see a clear trend emerging to suggest the overall aggregate absolute level of Off-Target is getting substantially worse, or better. ————- One of the reasons why a generator might be Off-Target is that the participant might have disregarded the dispatch target . (a) This is something that might happen at any Scheduled unit – and also any Semi-Scheduled unit (in periods where the Semi-Dispatch Cap flag was set) . (b) Remembering that it’s impossible to know a participants motivation , though it does not stop people (including us) guessing at what it might be, we wonder whether some of these times where targets have been missed might have been conscious choices for commercial reasons. I already posted in September 2018 about the curly questions raised by what seems to be behaviour on 24th August at Lake Bonney 2 and Lake Bonney 3 Wind Farms (both Semi-Scheduled) that appears to be both: (a) contrary to what the increase in output AEMO asked them to do for local system security reasons; and (b) contrary to what the AER (or other participants) might have inferred from the bid that had been submitted to AEMO for that dispatch interval. In our Generator Report Card 2018 we are keen to understand the pattern, and trend, of these sorts of behavioural challenges for the AEMO (who still need to keep the system stable even in the case of participants doing unexpected things for what seems to be commercial reasons). Out of curiosity, our query for calendar 2018 revealed a number of other instances where output has gone the “wrong” direction , based on dispatch targets. In this post, I flag two separate examples and note that there were many more identified. I also want to flag that (to the extent possible in the time available before our Report Card is due) we want to investigate further to understand the specifics of what happened. Example 1) Lake Bonney 2 Wind Farm on 7th July 2018 Here’s what seems to be a carbon copy of the same thing at Lake Bonney 2 Wind Farm in the 10:35 dispatch interval on 7th July 2018: Again ( as in this case posted earlier about events a little later in July ), there was a rebid almost immediately afterwards that suggests the reason for what appears to be a trip in dispatch interval timeframe (but might have been a fast run back) was due to commercial reasons – i.e. avoidance of negative prices. Example 2) Bungala 1 Solar Farm on 14th September 2018 In my first version of this article [updated 15th January 2019 based on further information], I flagged another instance where output had gone the opposite direction to the dispatch target at the same time the Semi-Dispatch Cap was set, and prices were negative. This happened in the 11:40 dispatch interval on 14th September 2018 where we see Bungala 1 Solar Farm “tripping” output from 102MW down to 0MW: At 11:35:20 (roughly when the dispatch targets for 11:40 had been sent to Bungala asking them to remain steady at 102MW) the “Estimated Trading Price for the 12:00 half hour” had been down at –$666.26/MWh. However within 5 minutes, the solar farm output was down at 0MW – another unit OffTarget, but for unclear reasons. I wondered whether this was another instance of the same sort of behaviour, though I had noted uncertainty because: (a) There was no rebid . (a1) A rebid might have indicated a shift in availability (as a result of some form of physical problem at the plant causing the trip). (a2) Alternatively, it might have indicated change in allocation in capacity to avoid negative prices (as was the case for Lake Bonney 2). (a3) However, the different bidding requirements that semi-scheduled plant operate under make it more difficult to know what actually triggered the drop in load to 0MW (though people associated with the operation of the plant have since clarified that it was physical in nature – hence a plain vanilla trip like these , which is understandable at this early stage of plant life – see other comments about “the bathtub curve “). (b) We see the red line in the forecast section of the chart showing that ASEFS still thought the plant capable of outputting a fairly typical solar shape for the rest of the day (b1) I noted on 7th January when posting this article that, at first glance it seems that ASEFS did not see any technical issues on the plant. (b2) In the week since that time I have not had time to investigate further, and have had no specific information provided to me to help me understand the divergence between actual output and ASEFS forecast. Perhaps there is some form of lag between the units SCADA system and ASEFS that would mean that the forecast output was not revised downwards with the trip? ————- Notwithstanding the complexities of trying to infer motivations from available data (and particularly the greater complexity in doing the same for Semi-Scheduled plant – due to lesser information publication) we will ponder this further in the process of preparing our Generator Report Card.",

That’s a big percentage on the output, and a sizeable deviation in absolute terms. With the up-and-down nature of the the pattern in output across the day, one wonders whether this was wholly due to some unpredictable wind patterns, or whether there were plant-related issues (not seen in AWEFS) that led to the challenging day.

    "content": "Back in October 2018, we alerted our readers to the intention to prepare an extensive report card looking in detail at every single power station for which AEMO supplies data in the Australian National Electricity Market. Since that time, we thank those early-birds who have jumped at the chance to secure a heavily discounted copy of the report in advance of us completing any analysis. The savings they have made are our reward to them for the trust they have invested in us to complete high quality analysis. That early bird rate expired at the end of 31st December 2018 – but there is much still to do in the completion of the Report Card, so we are happy to extend a still discounted price for those who wish to send in an early order for the Report Card between now and when the report card is finally released (we expect in about 8 weeks). The new Order Form is here . For the benefit of those who asked before, if you don’t want to pay by credit card but would rather us invoice you when the report is available, please let us know when you send the form back to us . Over January and February, we will be heavily focused on the completion of the Report Card – we look forward to delivering this to our clients upon completion. (A) Three main components of work to be completed In the compilation of this report card, there are essentially three main components of work we are focused on in rough sequential order: Work Component #1 = data compilation Now that we’ve ticked over into 2019, we can start to crank the handle in the derivation of the range of (commercial, technical and other) metrics we have identified to cover the range of power stations operating in the NEM. We have compiled a list of more than 100 metrics and are investigating data for all of these. Not all of these metrics will find their way into the report – but it does provide some basis for understanding the level of rigor we are applying to this task. Work Component #2 = analysis and insight generation Once the we data sets have been assembled, we will distribute these to a team of analysts – with each analyst responsible for independent review of the data and production of a series of Key Insights from the data sets that will be collated, and hence form the basis of what we draw from in completion of part of the Report Card. Our team includes both: (a) people within Global-Roam and our partners in the Report Card, Greenview Strategic Consulting; plus (b) a selection of external analysts we have hand-picked for their ability to work independently from us and each other to review the same data set and ensure we (collectively) identify the most useful insights . Some of these external analysts are already guest authors on WattClarity . Work Component #3 = preparation of the Report Card document The Report Card is being developed to include a focused report card page for every individual power station (and battery). The core metrics that tell the most important stories will be included on these report card pages. On top of this, the compiled list of Key Insights (some market wide, and perhaps some specific to regions or fuel types etc…) will be compiled, ranked and included in the report. All-together, the report will span hundreds of pages. (B) Early insights, about the spread of transmission constraints One of the significant parameters (technically) that all generators should be keenly aware of is the nature of constraint equations – how they can affect both the price outcomes in the regions you care about in the market, but also the dispatch of Scheduled and Semi-Scheduled generation. For our Report Card, we have started the preparation of a number of metrics relating to the effect of different types of constraint equations on unit targets. As a simple first case with preliminary data, in the chart below we trend a count (and percentage) of the number of units subject to any form of bound constraint equation during a given month: We see that, for most months , the percentage of DUIDs subject to constraints is somewhere between 30% and 50% (up to 200 DUIDs affected each month). In our Report Card we intend to explore, for each power station, which are the most significant constraint equations from their perspective. The specific units affected, the constraint equations (and their specific purpose), and the relative incidence will all vary over time – we are in the process of exploring, to report further. For all of those new generation developers who read WattClarity, particularly those who have minimal prior experience in the NEM (some of whom might be currently thinking “my project won’t be affected” , or even have been told that by others ), you might want to reflect on the trend of this historical percentage incidence and think about the chances that your own projects will avoid being subject to transmission constraints? ——- PS on Wed 2nd Jan 2019 Intrigued by some of the numbers that were extracted above, we aggregated the data to annual and present them in trended distributions in the second chart below: Three things particularly stands out to me in this chart: 1) When looking across a whole year, we see that it’s quite common for 50% of all DUIDs that are operational in that year to experience some form of constraint. 2) For DUIDs when this happens, they almost always experience at least 100 Dispatch Intervals of bound constraint (i.e. quite rare to be greater than 0 but less than 100). 3) In many years recently we see dozens of units (DUIDs) which are subject to constraints at least 10,000 Dispatch Intervals in a year (i.e. more than 10% of the time ) and sometimes up to 40,000 dispatch intervals (i.e. 40% of the time) . Amongst these, I suspect, will be Semi-Scheduled (Wind and Solar) units subject to the System Strength constraint in South Australia – the work we are doing in the Generator Report Card 2018 will reveal the specific units. The main take-away, here, is that constraints are obviously not a peripheral consideration for any unit. ——- (C) Send back your completed Pre-Order Form, or give us a call to discuss The updated Order Form is here , with a discount available for orders received prior to the publication of the report.
