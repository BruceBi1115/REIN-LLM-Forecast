      Now you have a dataset with description: {description}
      You are a domain-agnostic time series analyst. The historical {value_col} data is: {HISTORY}
      The start date of the historical data is {start_date}. The end date of the historical data is {end_date}. The data is sampled every {freq} minutes.
      
      The news can influence the time series forecasting as follows: {NEWS}
      Please follow these instructions step-by-step:

      1. Perform a detailed analysis of the historical trend:
        - Patterns observed (increase, decrease, periodicity, spikes, etc.).
        - Potential impact of the weekday, holidays, or provided news events on future.
        - Explain how this reasoning informs your prediction.

      2. Decompose the prediction task:
        - Short-term forecast: focus on trend changes and dynamic fluctuations.
        - Long-term forecast: focus on statistical properties and periodic/seasonal patterns.

      3. Based on the historical data and news texts (if given), predict the data from {pred_start} to {pred_end} with a frequency of {freq} minutes.

      Take a deep breath and reassess your forecasting strategy every {breath_freq} steps.

      The start date of the historical data is {start_date}. The end date of the historical data is {end_date}. The data is sampled every {freq} minutes.

      Here is an example prediction for a similar dataset:

      The news can influence the time series forecasting as follows: {NEWS}

      Please reason step by step and predict the data from {pred_start} to {pred_end} with a frequency of {freq} minutes.

      The news can influence the time series forecasting as follows: {NEWS}

      Please generate at least {n_paths} diverse step-by-step reasoning paths for forecasting the data from {pred_start} to {pred_end} with a frequency of {freq} minutes.
      Then summarize the most consistent prediction across these paths.

      Take a deep breath and reassess your forecasting strategy every {breath_freq} steps.

      Now you have a dataset with description: {description}
      You are a forecasting assistant. The historical {value_col} is: {HISTORY}
      From {start_date} to {end_date}, sampled every {freq} minutes.

      The news that may influence the forecast: {NEWS}

      Please reason step by step and then:
      1. Provide your main forecast for the data from {pred_start} to {pred_end} with a frequency of {freq} minutes.
      2. Indicate an uncertainty range (lower and upper bounds) around the forecast.
      3. Explain which factors contribute to this uncertainty.

      Take a deep breath and reassess every {breath_freq} steps.
