    "title": "CDC Confirms Three Human Cases of H5 Bird Flu Among Colorado Poultry Workers",
    "date": "2025-05-23",
    "content": "July 25, 2024 – Three additional human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) (“H5 bird flu”) virus infection have been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in association with a second poultry farm in Northeast Colorado/Weld County. Colorado previously announced one of them as a presumptive positive case on Saturday, July 20. The three confirmed cases occurred in people who were working directly with infected poultry at a commercial egg layer operation that had reported an outbreak of H5 bird flu among poultry.\nAll three people have mild illness and have been offered the antiviral drug, oseltamivir, for treatment. State and local officials continue to monitor poultry workers on farms with infected poultry. This is a different farm in Colorado from the one where on Friday, July 19, CDC confirmed two additional human cases of H5 bird flu , which brought the total human cases associated with that first poultry farm to six. With the addition of these three new confirmed human cases, the total number of human cases associated with the current poultry outbreaks in Colorado is nine. A CDC multidisciplinary, bilingual field team is currently deployed to support Colorado’s response to ongoing poultry outbreaks of H5 bird flu in the state.\nConfirmation of these three additional cases brings the total number of human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States since April 2024 to 13. Prior to 2024, the only previous human case of H5N1 bird flu in the United States was reported among a poultry worker in Colorado in April 2022 . Counting that case, there have been 14 total human cases of H5 bird flu in the United States since 2022.\nBased on available data, CDC’s current assessment is that the risk to the general public from H5N1 remains low. As we learn more, we will continue to assess the situation and provide updates. These preliminary results again underscore the risk of exposure to infected animals. There are no signs of unexpected increases in flu activity otherwise in Colorado, or in other states affected by H5 bird flu outbreaks in cows and poultry. Human infections with this novel influenza A virus (and others) are concerning because of the potential to cause severe, widespread disease. To date, we have not seen genetic changes in the virus that would make it more likely to transmit between humans, but we are closely monitoring it.\nCDC’s recommendations related to H5 virus have not changed at this time. Findings from the investigation will inform whether guidance changes are needed. The investigation will include looking into compliance with the recommended use of personal protective equipment. Historically, most human cases of bird flu infection have happened in people who are not wearing recommended personal protective equipment. An analysis of the virus sequences from this outbreak also will be important to determine if a change in the risk assessment is warranted.\nCDC Recommendations\n•\tPeople should avoid unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals (including cows).\n•\tPeople should also avoid unprotected exposures to animal feces (poop), bedding (litter), unpasteurized (“raw”) milk, or materials that have been touched by, or close to, birds or other animals with suspected or confirmed A(H5N1) virus.\n•\tCDC has interim recommendations for prevention, monitoring, and public health investigations of A(H5N1) virus infections in people. CDC also has updated recommendations for worker protection and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) . Following these recommendations is central to reducing a person’s risk and containing the overall public health risk."

    "title": "CDC Data Show Improvements in Youth Mental Health but Need for Safer and More Supportive Schools",
    "date": "2025-08-19",
    "content": "August 6, 2024 – New CDC data released today highlight improvements in mental health among some United States teens, including decreases in the percentage of students feeling persistently sad or hopeless. However, the report also highlights concerning increases in the percentage of teens reporting experiences of school-based violence and absenteeism due to safety concerns.\nToday's report provides a detailed analysis of the health behaviors and experiences of high school students across the nation, comparing 2021 and 2023 Youth Risk Behavior Survey data. The 2021 data are drawn from a year when schooling was still substantially disrupted due to COVID. The report also provides 10-year data trends by sex, race and ethnicity, and sexual and gender identity. As students head back to school, these data are critical to highlighting the challenges faced by millions of young people so that communities can better address their health and safety.\n\"One of our main priorities at CDC is improving Americans' mental health,\" said Debra Houry, M.D., M.P.H., CDC's chief medical officer and deputy director for program and science. \"The data released today show improvements to a number of metrics that measure young people's mental well-being – progress we can build on. However, this work is far from complete. Every child should feel safe and supported, and CDC will continue its work to turn this data into action until we reach that goal.\"\nKey improvements to youth mental health from 2021 to 2023 include:\nDecreases in the percentage of students overall who experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness (from 42% to 40%).\nDecreases in the percentage of female students who experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness (from 57% to 53%) and who seriously considered attempting suicide (30% to 27%).\nDecreases in the percentage of Hispanic students who felt persistently sad or hopeless (from 46% to 42%), who experienced poor mental health (30% to 26%), who seriously considered attempting suicide (22% to 18%) and who made a suicide plan (19% to 16%).\nDecreases in the percentage of Black students who attempted suicide (from 14% to 10%) and who were injured in a suicide attempt (4% to 2%).\nDespite these positive signs, there are increases in the percentage of students reporting violence and safety concerns at school or on the way to school:\nIncreases in the percentage of students who were threatened or injured with a weapon at school (7% to 9%).\nIncreases in the percentage of students who were bullied at school (15% to 19%).\nIncreases in the percentage of students who missed school because of safety concerns either at school or on the way to school (9% to 13%).\nToday's report also underscores significant health disparities, particularly among female and LGBTQ+ high school students, who report higher rates of violence, poor mental health and suicidal thoughts and behaviors than their peers. In 2023, nearly three in 10 LGBTQ+ students were bullied at school, and two in 10 attempted suicide.\n\"These data show that we've made some progress in tackling these issues in recent years, which proves that they are not insurmountable. However, there's still much work ahead,\" said CDC Division of Adolescent and School Health Director Kathleen Ethier, Ph.D. \"Considering the vital role schools play in promoting health and well-being, it is critical to address school-based violence and safety concerns.\"\nCDC's What Works in Schools program helps promote adolescent health and well-being by supporting school districts to teach quality health education, connect young people to needed health services and make school environments safer and more supportive. This program positively impacts many behaviors and experiences presented in today's report.\nCDC has collected and analyzed data on youth health and well-being for more than three decades. Data are analyzed from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which monitors adolescent health behaviors and experiences over time. It identifies emerging issues and helps us understand health-related topics affecting youth, including mental health. Overall, it gives the best picture of what is going on at the national, state, and local level.\nAdditional Resources\nPromoting Mental Health and Well-Being in Schools: An Action Guide for School and District Leaders can help schools build on what they are already doing to promote students' mental health and find new strategies to fill in gaps.\nViolence Prevention in Practice | VetoViolence (cdc.gov) focuses on TAKING ACTION to select and implement the strategies presented in the Division of Violence Prevention's (DVP) Resources for Action .\nYouth Violence Prevention Resource for Action (cdc.gov) represents a select group of strategies based on the best available evidence to help communities and states sharpen their focus on prevention activities with the greatest potential to prevent youth violence and its consequences.\nContact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline if you are experiencing mental health-related distress or are worried about a loved one who may need crisis support."

    "title": "Vaccines for Children Program Celebrates 30 Years of Providing Lifesaving Vaccines to Children at No Cost",
    "date": "2025-08-19",
    "content": "When the Vaccines for Children (VFC) legislation was passed 30 years ago, it was a historic step in improving children's lives by providing recommended vaccines at no cost to eligible children.\nRoutine vaccinations are the best defense against illnesses. The VFC program was established to ensure that children below the federal poverty level and those without health insurance have access to critical, lifesaving vaccines that can protect their health throughout their lives.\nAlmost 90% of VFC-eligible children born during 2011–2020 received the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to a new CDC Vital Signs report. There were no differences in receipt of the MMR vaccine found among VFC-eligible children born in 2020 by race and ethnicity, poverty status, and urban-rural residency. This highlights VFC program efforts in achieving and maintaining measles elimination status in the U.S.\nIn addition, the new CDC Vital Signs report shows routine childhood rotavirus vaccination increased from 65% to 71% among children born in 2011–2020, which shows progress toward achieving high vaccination coverage (proportion of children vaccinated) for all routine immunizations.\nFurthermore, a CDC report , issued on August 8, 2024, found that for children born during 1994–2023, routine childhood vaccinations will have prevented approximately 508 million cases of illness, 32 million hospitalizations, and 1,129,000 deaths, resulting in societal savings of nearly $2.7 trillion, including a direct savings of $540 billion.\nDespite these successes, the new CDC Vital Signs report shows there is still a need to increase the number of children who complete their vaccine series and a need to reach children living below the poverty level and those without health insurance.\nOnly 61% of VFC-eligible children (born in 2020) received 7 selected vaccines (the \" combined 7-vaccine series \") by their second birthday. This series includes all recommended doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, poliovirus vaccine, measles-containing vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (Hib), hepatitis B vaccine, varicella vaccine, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV). Of these vaccines, coverage among VFC-eligible children born in 2020 was about 90% for first doses of vaccines (varicella, MMR) and for series given earlier in life (poliovirus, hepatitis B vaccine).\nVaccination coverage was lowest (74%-77%) for vaccines that require multiple doses, with at least one dose recommended after 12 months of age (DTaP, PCV, and Hib). This suggests children face challenges to receiving vaccines that require multiple doses as well as doses in the second year of life.\nVaccination coverage was lower among uninsured children than among Medicaid-insured children. Uninsured children are more likely to live at or below the federal poverty level and have not seen a healthcare provider in the past year. They are less likely to complete vaccine series that require multiple doses.\nVFC-eligible children living below the federal poverty level had lower coverage for rotavirus vaccine and the combined 7-vaccine series compared with VFC-eligible children living at or above the poverty level. Although the VFC program provides recommended childhood vaccines at no cost, non-Medicaid VFC-eligible children, including those who are uninsured, can be charged a vaccine administration fee, and there may also be fees for an office visit or non-vaccine services received during the visit.\nHealthcare providers can help reduce missed opportunities for vaccination by giving catch-up vaccinations to all children who are behind. The VFC program plays a vital role in increasing and sustaining vaccination coverage for all vaccinations, including flu and COVID-19 vaccinations. Heightened efforts must ensure those eligible for the VFC program are aware of, have confidence in, and are able to receive all recommended vaccines.\nHealthcare providers can:\nOffer accurate information on vaccination benefits.\nGive catch-up vaccines and review for needed vaccines, including those that protect children in the fall virus season that includes flu and other respiratory viruses.\nStrengthen relationships with families.\nUse reminder/recall systems to inform parents of upcoming or missed shots.\nThe Vaccines for Children program is administered nationally by CDC, which provides operational funding to 61 state, local, and territorial immunization programs. Funding recipients implement and oversee the VFC program in their respective areas. The federal government purchases pediatric vaccines at a discount and ships them directly to enrolled VFC vaccine providers to ease the fiscal burden of vaccine purchase and distribution. The VFC program ensures that all children have a better chance of getting their recommended vaccinations on schedule which means healthier children, families, and communities.\nFor more information on VFC eligibility for children, go to Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program: Information for Parents | VFC Program | CDC .\nIf you are a healthcare provider interested in enrolling in the VFC program to help ensure all families can get the vaccines they need, please visit Vaccines For Children (VFC) Program Information for Providers | CDC .\nFor more information about this report, go to www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns ."

I would like to inform all participants that your lines have been placed on a listen only mode until the question and answer session of today's call. Today's call is also being recorded. If you do have any objections, you may disconnect at this time, and I will now turn the call over to Brittany, Manchester. Thank you. You may begin.\nBrittney Manchester 00:23\nThank you Sue and thank you all for joining us today as we release a new CDC vital signs. We are joined today by our two speakers, Dr. Deborah Houry, CDC chief medical officer and Dr. Georgina Peacock, Director of CDC immunization Services Division, this briefing is embargoed until 1pm eastern today, when our vital signs will go live on the CDC website. I'll now turn the call over to Dr. Houry.\nDr. Debra Houry 00:55\nRoutine vaccinations are our best defense against illnesses that can make kids seriously ill, a key tool that can keep kids healthy in school and ready to learn. Vaccines have saved lives for over 100 years, but serious disease is still a major threat to those unvaccinated. Getting vaccinated on time is essential throughout childhood and with back to school around the corner. Now is a great time for families to check if your child is up to date with their routine health care. Today, in this vital signs report, we report data on a landmark program started in 1994 by Congress, the Vaccines for Children, or VFC program. Congress established this program to provide routine vaccines at no cost to eligible children. Since the introduction of the VFC program, routine vaccination of children born during 1994 to 2023 will have prevented 508 million illnesses saved over 1 million lives, saving nearly 2.7 trillion in societal costs. This means that every dollar spent on childhood immunizations results in a savings of approximately $11 in 2023 VFC distributed over 74 million doses of pediatric vaccines to participating healthcare providers, anyone ages 18 or younger who is Medicaid eligible, uninsured, underinsured or American Indian or Alaska Native can receive vaccines from VFC program providers at no cost. CDC currently funds 61 state, local and territorial immunization programs to implement the VFC program at over 37,000 enrolled locations, providing all recommended childhood vaccinations against 19 different diseases. Supporting young families is a priority for CDC public health efforts. This program serves as one of the nation's most important contributors to health equity. It helps all children have a better chance of getting their recommended vaccinations on schedule. Vaccinating on time means healthier children, families and communities. Now I will turn it over to Dr. Georgina Peacock, who will highlight the findings of today's vital signs report.\nDr. Georgina Peacock 03:22\nThank you, Dr. Houry. Today's vital signs highlights the historic success of the Vaccines for Children program and how we can further reduce gaps in vaccination coverage for eligible children. Vaccination coverage is the estimated percentage of people who have received specific vaccines. The vital signs report found that almost 90% of VFC eligible children born in 2020 received the measles, mumps and rubella or MMR vaccine with no differences in coverage by race and ethnicity, poverty status or living in urban versus rural areas. These new data shows the VFC program has helped ensure that all children can receive life saving vaccine. There are still opportunities to increase coverage with recommended vaccines for VFC eligible children. Vaccination coverage among VFC eligible children born in 2011 through 2020 was lower than that among children not eligible for VFC who were born in those same years. For children born in 2020, vaccination coverage was lower among VFC eligible children who were uninsured compared to those who were enrolled in Medicaid. Coverage was also lower for those living below versus at or above the poverty level, except for the MMR vaccine. Although the VFC program provides recommended childhood vaccine at no cost, uninsured children and children living in poverty may face other barriers to vaccination. The. Combined coverage for the seven selected vaccines known as the combined seven series, was just over 61% for VFC eligible children born in 2020 for individual vaccines in these series, uptake was highest around 90% for the first doses of vaccines and vaccines given earlier in life, vaccination coverage was lowest for vaccines that require multiple doses with at least one dose given after 12 months of age. This suggests children face challenges to receiving vaccines that require multiple doses as well as doses in the second year of life. For the rotavirus vaccine, which was not included in the combined seven series, vaccination coverage by eight months among VFC eligible children was up to 71% increasing modestly each year. Healthcare providers can help increase vaccination coverage by strongly recommending vaccines and assessing the needs for vaccines at every visit, together, we can increase the number of children receiving recommended vaccinations and help protect children from illness and severe disease.\nDr. Debra Houry 06:12\nThank you, Dr. Peacock. This vital signs report identifies the many successes of the Vaccines for Children program, but also highlights the need to reduce the gaps in vaccination coverage for children living below the poverty level and those without health insurance. We need to do more. Health care providers are our crucial partners to increase the number of children who complete their vaccine series and reach those children living below the poverty level and without health insurance, health care providers can promote vaccinations by encouraging all recommended childhood vaccines, strengthening family provider relationships, educating parents about vaccine benefits and participating in the VFC program to provide vaccinations during routine appointments for those who qualify, CDC launched, let's rise or routine immunizations on schedule for everyone and 2023 to get Americans caught up on vaccines that were missed or delayed during the covid 19 pandemic. This will help make sure that children and adolescents are up to date with all recommended vaccines, and can help keep kids healthy in school and ready to learn. Families can get vaccinations for their child at any private doctor, private clinic, hospital, public health clinic, community health clinic, schools or pharmacy that is an enrolled BFC program provider. To find a BFC program provider near you, contact your state or local health department. I will now open it up for questions.\nBrittney Manchester 07:46\nThank you, Dr. Houry and Dr. Peacock. Sue, we are ready for questions.\nModerator 07:52\nThank you at this time, if you would like to ask a question, please ensure that your phone is unmuted. Press star one and record your name clearly when prompted, if you would need to withdraw your request, you may press star two again to ask a question that is star one. And we do ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up question, one moment for the first question, our first question is from Mike Stobbe with the Associated Press. You may go ahead.\nMike Stobbe 08:28\nHi. Thank you for doing this call and for taking my question. My first question is, I'm sorry I see information about vaccine eligible children, but I was wondering if there's a statistic about just how many children in the US get shots through VFC each year. I having trouble finding a simple statement about how many children, or what percentage of us children, get their vaccinations through VFC. And my follow up question. You talked about the DR hour. You talked about the importance of medical providers. I was wondering if you could say a little bit more about participation by providers in DFC. Is that increasing or decreasing? Is it at the level you need? Is there a goal you're trying to reach? Thank you. Hi, thanks.\nDr. Georgina Peacock 09:21\nThis is Dr. Peacock. So the answer to your first question is that there are more than about 40 million children that are eligible for VFC. So we estimate that about half of the children in the United States receive their vaccinations through VFC. As far as vaccination, or, sorry, participation. We currently have about 37,000 providers. We do know that there are places where there is a need for increased access to vaccinations, and therefore we are still looking to increase the number of VFC providers this year in particular. We are focusing on enrolling more birthing hospitals as VFC providers. Last year, as you know, we launched the new immunization nirsevimab, which protects infants against RSV and the best place for those infants to get that immunization is in a birthing hospital before they go home, and therefore increasing the number of birthing hospitals that are VFC providers provides them that access before they're discharged to home.\nDr. Debra Houry 10:27\nAnd this is Dr. Houry. The thing I would just add is that I think it's important to have both improved access as well as improved and increased confidence. And so this is where providers have such a key role, is ensuring that confidence and having those conversations with parents, and this is where media also has an important role in increasing confidence in the science that we do and promoting the need for vaccines, particularly as all of our kiddos are going back to school.\nModerator 10:57\nThank you. At this time, there are no further questions as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one one moment to see if we have any further questions. You one moment for the next question. Our next question is from Nick Karmia, KJZZ news in Phoenix, you may go ahead.\nNick Karmia 11:38\nThank you so much. You guys hear me, okay?\nNick Karmia 11:44\nawesome once again. Thank you for making this call happen. Just curious. We're an NPR member station out here in Phoenix, and we were wondering if you could provide any data that's specific to the States. I know that you had mentioned just before, 30,000 37,000 different locations. Are there? Are there a lot of those inside of Arizona, are those consolidated and particular states within the country?\nDr. Georgina Peacock 12:15\nSo there are, this is Dr. Peacock, there are vaccine providers that our VFC providers in every state, the Vaccines for Children program is actually administered through state immunization programs, and so therefore, the Arizona State Health Department runs an immunization program and enrolls VFC providers In that program.\nNick Karmia 12:40\nJust a quick follow up for you. I know that you, if I'm recalling correctly here, you had mentioned low rates with vaccines, or low rates among children getting vaccinated with vaccines that required multiple doses. Is there a particular reason for that is that? Is that coming just out of the pandemic needing multiple doses for the COVID vaccine. Where does kind of that lack of confidence coming from?\nDr. Georgina Peacock 13:07\nSo some of that may be lack of confidence. Some of that can be access. So many of the vaccines that are offered in the first two years of life, you need more than one in those series. So, for example, the DTaP, you get three of those doses in that first two years of life. And so what we found was that there, there was a higher likelihood that children got that first dose, but then, because they need to get those three doses. Therefore, when we moved into the second year of life, we saw that those theories were not necessarily completed, and so the seven combined series is the doses, all of those doses that are needed in those first two years of life to therefore be up to date with that vaccination. Thank you.\nModerator 14:06\nThank you. And as a reminder, that is star one. If you would like to ask a question, our next question is from Mike Stobbe with the Associated Press. You may go ahead.\nMike Stobbe 14:18\nHi, thanks. I'll go again, if the opportunity affords itself, thank you. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the difference in vaccination coverage between VFC eligible and non eligible. And what's happened lately, the information seems to cut off at 2020. I was wondering if you had additional information about vaccination rates for MMR or the seven vaccine series or rotavirus Since 2020 what's been happening is VFC having more success in the last three or four years, or less success. Can you give us an understanding of how things are trending? I.\nDr. Georgina Peacock 15:00\nSo in order to look at, for example, the completion of the seven combined vaccine series, we need children to reach two years of age in order to provide that information. And that's why we're looking at children in this particular study from that 2020, birth year. I'm going to turn it over to the first author of the study to see if she has anything to add. Madeleine Valier.\nMadeleine Valier 15:26\nHi, yes, I would just like to add that this study uses the most recent data we have available. It's the 2022 National Immunization Survey child data. The 2023 data is currently being analyzed and is slated to be published later this year.\nMike Stobbe 15:41\nOh, great. And who was that?\nMadeleine Valier 15:43\nMadeleine Valier, yes, this is Madeleine Valier. thank you.\nMike Stobbe 15:52\nThank you.\nModerator 15:53\nAnd at this time, there are no further questions. Again, as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one one moment to see if there's any further questions, and one moment for the next question. Our next question is from Helena Olivera with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. You may go ahead.\nHelena Olivera 16:23\nYeah, hi. Thank you so much, and thanks for taking my question. This is probably somewhere in the report or the study. I just don't see it, so I want to make sure I have it at my fingertips when you hear when you talk about almost 90% of VFC eligible children born between 2011 and 220 received the MMR vaccine. What? What is the percent of non VFC eligible children that have gotten the MMR vaccine during that time period?\nMadeleine Valier 17:01\nHi, this is Madeleine Valier. In the study, we don't specifically publish coverage among non VSC eligible children, but we do show the difference in coverage. So if you take 90% and then the difference in coverage is about three and a half percentage points among children born in 2020 you'll see that the coverage among non VSC eligible children is just over 93% Great. Thank you.\nModerator 17:29\nThank you. Our next question is from Youri Benadjaoud with ABC News, you may go ahead.\nYouri Benadjaoud 17:37\nHi there. Thanks for taking my question. I have a more general question in regards to immunization of minors in general, I understand that this study looked at particularly younger populations, but a lot of states are cracking down on and I'm thinking particularly of Tennessee, whether children, you know, can get vaccinated without the presence of their parent. I'm wondering if the CDC has any thoughts on that, or on how that may, you know, be another barrier to to getting children vaccinated. Thanks.\nDr. Georgina Peacock 18:10\nHi. This is Dr. Peacock. So those types of consent laws tend to be at the state level, and so it would be important to follow up specifically with sort of state immunization programs or departments of health on the that information.\nYouri Benadjaoud 18:31\nThank you,\nModerator 18:32\nand that was our last question. I will now turn it back to the speakers for any closing remarks.\nBrittney Manchester 18:38\nThank you, Dr. Houry and Dr. Peacock for joining us today, as well as all the reporters on the line for any follow up questions, please call the CDC Division of Media Relations at 404-639-3286 or send us an email at media@cdc.gov Thank you again for joining us. This now concludes our call.\nModerator 19:02\nThank you that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect. You."

    "title": "FACT SHEET: United States Response to the Clade I Mpox Outbreak in Several African Countries",
    "date": "2025-08-20",
    "content": "On August 14, 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern about the upsurge of mpox cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and a growing number of countries in Africa. This announcement followed the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention's (Africa CDC) declaration of a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security on August 13. The significant increase of clade I mpox cases, in both endemic countries (those that have previously had mpox outbreaks) and non-endemic countries (those that have historically not reported mpox outbreaks), threatens the health security of the region, as well as countries outside Africa. In addition, clade I mpox has a newer sub-clade referred to as clade Ib. Both clade Ia and clade Ib are circulating in DRC and have been detected in neighboring countries and in Sweden and Thailand (one case each associated with travel to Africa with known clade I cases).\nIn 2022, the world experienced a global outbreak of clade IIb mpox, which led to more than 95,000 cases across 115 non-endemic countries and continues to occur in the United States. The Biden-Harris Administration responded by ensuring the JYNNEOS mpox vaccine was available to at-risk populations in the U.S.\nIn February, as the clade I mpox outbreak grew in DRC, the Biden-Harris Administration established an incident response structure across federal departments and agencies to ensure a coordinated response and to take a proactive approach to U.S. domestic preparedness for potential clade I mpox cases. Clade I mpox causes a higher number of severe infections and has a higher mortality rate than clade IIb mpox. Because evidence for clade I mpox clinical outcomes is based primarily on data from endemic countries without widespread supportive care, particularly DRC, we do not yet know how clade I mpox would impact Americans; we do expect it would cause lower morbidity and mortality in the United States.\nUnited States preparedness for clade I mpox\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has been closely monitoring the spread of mpox, specifically clade I mpox, and has been working since December 2023 to prepare domestically. The risk to most Americans from clade I mpox circulating in Central and Eastern Africa and the travel associated cases outside of Africa is very low, and there are no known cases in the United States at this time. The United States is well prepared to rapidly detect, contain, and manage clade I cases should they occur domestically.\nThe United States continues to increase our capacity to detect cases of clade I and clade IIb mpox through existing surveillance systems, including wastewater testing, and through expanding the robust diagnostic testing capacity built during the ongoing clade IIb outbreak to ensure coverage for clade I. The ability to expedite such diagnostic testing—in particular for those with recent travel to DRC or neighboring countries—also supports rapid detection. In addition to reaffirming the importance of mpox vaccination for those who are eligible , we are working to prevent the spread of both clades of mpox by providing and disseminating recommendations for clinicians, health departments, diagnostic laboratories, and the public.\nFrom August 2022 to August 2024, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), distributed more than one million vials of the JYNNEOS vaccine across the United States to mitigate the spread and severity of the clade II mpox outbreak. In addition to the preventive vaccine, partners across the U.S. government are working to better understand the effectiveness of existing treatments for mpox and have treatment options available in the event that clade I mpox is reported in the United States. The United States will continue to provide information to the public on transmission, prevention, and treatment of mpox. Those who have already had clade IIb mpox or who are fully vaccinated against it are expected to be protected against clade I mpox.\nCDC has issued an updated Health Alert Network advisory for clinicians and public health departments and partners, as well as an updated Travel Health Notice , recommending travelers to DRC and neighboring countries to practice enhanced precautions. Through the State Department, our embassies are working to keep U.S. citizens abroad informed of these updates. At this time, CDC and WHO do not discourage travel to DRC or elsewhere due to the mpox outbreaks.\nUnited States support to the global mpox outbreak\nThe U.S. government has been closely monitoring the spread of clade I mpox in DRC and the risk to neighboring countries since 2023, and we have been working closely with the affected country governments and regional and global health partners to reduce the impact of this outbreak and safeguard public health. The U.S. government support for the mpox response builds on our longstanding partnerships in global health security and development with DRC and throughout Africa, which have helped to combat infectious diseases, such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria for more than 20 years. In fiscal year 2023, the United States allocated more than $2.65 billion in bilateral health funding to countries in Central and Eastern Africa and is the largest global health donor.\nSince March 2024, USAID and CDC together have provided an additional $20 million USD to support clade I mpox response efforts in Central and Eastern Africa, and on August 20, USAID announced up to an additional $35 million in emergency health assistance to bolster response efforts, pending Congressional Notification, bringing the proposed total U.S. government financial support for DRC and other affected countries in the region to more than $55 million.\nIn addition to direct financial support, the United States government is surging staff to support the mpox response. More than 200 staff including epidemiologists, laboratorians, and risk communication experts have been deployed to support response efforts in the United States and Africa. United States government support has focused on a range of critical public health interventions aimed at limiting transmission and reducing mpox morbidity and mortality. These interventions include surveillance with deployment of additional local field epidemiologists, risk communication and community engagement, laboratory supplies and diagnostics, infection prevention and control, clinical services, and vaccine planning.\nIn addition to scaling up surveillance, testing, and treatment of cases, vaccination will be a critical element of the response to this outbreak. Successful vaccination campaigns will require health workers to provide vaccinations, financial support to roll out vaccine and vaccination supplies, and regulatory approval for use of vaccines in affected countries. To support this effort, USAID is donating 50,000 doses of the FDA-approved JYNNEOS vaccine to DRC, as well as financial support for rollout of the vaccine doses. The United States is working with other countries that have vaccine stockpiles, WHO, and international partners to encourage additional donations that support vaccine efforts and address challenges with vaccine delivery. This includes evaluating vaccine demand, supporting country engagement on regulatory pathways, planning vaccine implementation, and providing technical assistance to deliver the vaccines.\nThe United States is working with bilateral, multilateral, and private sector partners to develop and implement a coordinated response – including encouraging collaboration between WHO and Africa CDC on their response plans. The United States, through the State Department, will continue working through the U.S.-Africa CDC Joint Action Plan adopted in November 2023 to increase African Union Member States' capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to health emergencies.\nThe Biden-Harris Administration will continue its whole-of-government response to this growing outbreak, building on lessons learned from the 2022 mpox response.

    "date": "2025-08-19",
    "content": "Today, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced more than $558 million in funding to improve maternal health, building on the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to reducing the nation's high maternal mortality rate through the White House Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis . The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), an agency of HHS, is awarding more than $440 million in funding to expand voluntary, evidence-based maternal, infant, and early childhood home visiting services for eligible families across the country. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced a new investment of $118.5 million, over five years, to 46 states, six territories and freely associated statesto continue building the public health infrastructure to better identify and prevent pregnancy-related deaths.\nIn 2022, President Biden signed bipartisan legislation that doubles funding for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program over five years – the first expansion of the federal home visiting program in nearly 10 years. Through this program, local organizations can provide home visits from nurses, social workers, and other trained health workers who work with families on early and ongoing engagement in prenatal care and postpartum support. They provide support on breastfeeding, safe sleep for babies, learning and communications practices that promote early language development, developmental screening, getting children ready to succeed in school, and connecting with key services and resources in the community – like affordable childcare or job and educational opportunities. The awards announced today reflect the first opportunity for states and jurisdictions to receive federal matching funds in addition to their base grants. Every single state and U.S. territory has seen an increase in funding to their home visiting program since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration.\n\"As someone who has spent my entire career fighting for the health and wellbeing of women and children, I am committed to addressing a maternal health crisis in which women across America are dying before, during, and after childbirth at higher rates than in any other developed nation. That is why I called on states to extend Medicaid postpartum coverage from two months to 12 months and announced the launch of the White House Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis, an unprecedented whole-of-government strategy to improving maternal care,\" said Vice President Harris. \"Today, we are building on this lifesaving work by awarding more than $558 million to improve maternal health across America. This includes a critical $440 million to support pregnant women, new mothers, and their children through home visiting programs that will improve health outcomes, child development, and access to resources for years to come.\"\n\"Bringing home a baby can be stressful. Many new parents face additional challenges such as housing, or income insecurity, which can make the whole situation even more daunting. But we know from decades of research that home visits work – from helping with school readiness and achievement for children to improving health for women,\" said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. \"President Biden and Vice President Harris know how important it is to support children in their most crucial years of development so they can grow up to be healthy, happy adults. We will continue to make resources and support available, and elevate maternal health issues so that more women and families know that help is available.\"\n\"At the Health Resources and Services Administration, we are deeply committed to removing barriers to care for expectant and new moms and babies who face too many hurdles getting the support that they need,\" said HRSA Administrator Carole Johnson. \"That's why – thanks to the leadership of the President and Vice President – we were able to work closely with bipartisan leaders in Congress to grow the home visiting program to give more moms and babies a trusted home visiting partner to help their families in ways large and small to be healthy, feel supported, access health care services, nurture their child's development, and give families every opportunity to thrive.\"\nHRSA Administrator Carole Johnson announced the awards in conjunction with HRSA's Enhancing Maternal Health Initiative convening at Wayne State University, in Detroit, Michigan. The Initiative is bringing together moms and babies served by HRSA programs with maternal and infant health community leaders, health officials, HRSA-supported community providers, and others to advance the goals of the White House Blueprint to Address the Maternal Health Crisis.\nThe home visiting program funds states, jurisdictions, and tribal entities to develop and implement evidence-based, voluntary programs that best meet the needs of their communities. Families choose to participate in home visiting programs from pregnancy up to kindergarten and partner with health, social services, and child development professionals who provide resources, support, and skills to help families and children be physically, socially, and emotionally healthy. The program has demonstrated significant benefits, including improved school readiness and achievement of children, improved health for women, increased health insurance coverage, and prevented child injuries, abuse, and neglect.\nFor a complete list of Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program awardees, visit https://mchb.hrsa.gov/programs-impact/programs/home-visiting/maternal-infant-early-childhood-home-visiting-miechv-program/fy24-awards .\nThe CDC's new $118.5 million five-year investment will continue building the public health infrastructure to better identify and prevent pregnancy-related deaths. This new investment expands support to Maternal Mortality Review Committees (MMRCs) from 46 to 52 states and U.S. territories and freely associated states . MRCs are state- and territory-based multidisciplinary groups that review deaths that have occurred within 1 year of the end of a pregnancy, determine if those pregnancy-related deaths were preventable, and recommend ways to prevent them in the future. This new investment in the Enhancing Reviews and Surveillance to Eliminate Maternal Mortality (ERASE MM) program also advances progress on implementing the White House Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis . CDC began the ERASE MM program in 2019 to invest in MMRCs and to strengthen and standardize their efforts to review deaths.\n\"Every pregnancy-related death is a tragedy for the family and the community,\" said Wanda Barfield, MD, MPH, director of CDC's Division of Reproductive Health. \"Thanks to MMRCs, we know more about the causes and circumstances around pregnancy-related deaths, and we have actionable recommendations to prevent future deaths. This investment will support more jurisdictions in their critical work to save mothers' lives.\"\nTogether, these efforts build on both HHS' and the broader Administration's efforts to implement the White House Blueprint to Address the Maternal Health Crisis as described in the following Fact Sheet: White House Blueprint to Address the Maternal Health Crisis: Two Years of Progress ."

    "title": "Youth E-Cigarette Use Drops to Lowest Level in a Decade",
    "date": "2024-09-11",
    "content": "Half a million fewer U.S. youth reported current use of e-cigarettes in 2024 compared to 2023, according to new data from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) released today by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The nationally representative data featured in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) includes findings on e-cigarette and nicotine pouch use among U.S. youth, two categories of tobacco products the FDA and CDC are monitoring closely, particularly regarding youth use and appeal.\nNYTS is an annual school-based, self-administered survey of U.S. middle (grades 6–8) and high school (grades 9–12) students conducted Jan. 22 to May 22, 2024. Findings showed there was a significant drop in the number of U.S. middle and high school students who reported current (past 30 days) e-cigarette use – a decrease from 2.13 million (7.7%) youth in 2023 to 1.63 million (5.9%) youth in 2024. This decline was largely driven by reduced e-cigarette use among high schoolers (1.56 million to 1.21 million), with no statistically significant change in current e-cigarette use among middle school students within the past year. The number of youth who used e-cigarettes in 2024 is approximately one-third of what it was at its peak in 2019, when over five million youth reported current e-cigarette use.\n\"The continued decline in e-cigarette use among our nation's youth is a monumental public health win,\" said Brian King, Ph.D., M.P.H., director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products. \"This progress is a testament to the relentless efforts by the FDA, CDC and others, particularly over the past half decade. But we can't rest on our laurels, as there's still more work to do to further reduce youth e-cigarette use.\"\nAmong youth who currently used e-cigarettes, 26.3% reported using e-cigarettes daily. The vast majority of youth who currently used e-cigarettes used flavored products (87.6%), with fruit (62.8%), candy (33.3%) and mint (25.1%) being the top three most commonly used flavors. Disposable e-cigarette products were the most common product type used; however, the most popular brands included both disposable and cartridge-based products. Among youth who currently used e-cigarettes, the most commonly reported brands were Elf Bar (36.1%), Breeze (19.9%), Mr. Fog (15.8%), Vuse (13.7%) and JUUL (12.6%).\nOver the past year, a substantive drop occurred in youth reporting use of e-cigarette products under the Elf Bar brand - from 56.7% in 2023 to 36.1% in 2024. Elf Bar is not authorized by the FDA and has been the subject of focused compliance and enforcement actions by the agency since early 2023, including more than 1,000 warning letters and 240 civil money penalties to retailers and others in the supply chain. The FDA has also issued import alerts that include products under the Elf Bar brand, which places them on the \"red list\" and allows the agency to detain products without conducting a full inspection at the time of entry.\n\"Youth use of tobacco products in any form—including e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches—is unsafe,\" said Deirdre Lawrence Kittner, Ph.D., M.P.H., director of CDC's Office on Smoking and Health. \"It's essential that we remain vigilant and committed to public health efforts to ensure all youth can live healthy, tobacco-free lives.\"\nYouth nicotine pouch use did not show a statistically significant change from 2023 (1.5% in 2023 and 1.8% in 2024). Of the nearly half a million middle and high school students who reported current nicotine pouch use, 22.4% used them daily. The most commonly reported brands among that group were Zyn (68.7%), on! (14.2%), Rogue (13.6%), Velo (10.7%) and Juice Head ZTN (9.8%). Among those who currently used nicotine pouches, the vast majority used flavored products (85.6%), with mint (53.3%), fruit (22.4%) and menthol (19.3%) being the most commonly used flavors.\n\"While it's encouraging to see these numbers currently remaining relatively low, the bottom line is that we are concerned about any youth appealing tobacco product,\" King said. \"Our guard is up. We are aware of the reported growing sales trends for nicotine pouches and are closely monitoring the evolving tobacco product landscape for threats to public health, particularly when it comes to kids.\"\nKeeping tobacco products out of the hands of youth remains a top priority for the FDA and CDC. As students head back to school, it is important for educators and parents to talk to teens about tobacco product use. The FDA and CDC have free information and resources available to assist these and other groups. For example, the FDA's Vaping Prevention and Education Resource Center is an online hub with free science-based lesson plans and materials for teachers and parents to promote learning and conversations about youth tobacco product use. The FDA's \"The Real Cost\" Youth E-Cigarette Prevention campaign also continues to reach approximately 90% of U.S. teens with its effective prevention messages. Additionally, CDC offers a suite of resources to help protect youth from the harms of vaping and other tobacco product use, including its \"Empower Vape-Free Youth\" campaign for middle and high school educators."

    "title": "CDC Confirms Human H5 Bird Flu Case in Missouri",
    "date": "2025-08-20",
    "content": "September 6, 2024 -- CDC has confirmed a human case of avian influenza A(H5) (\"H5 bird flu\") reported by the state of Missouri. The case was identified through that state's seasonal flu surveillance system. The specimen was forwarded to CDC for confirmatory testing per usual protocols and confirmed yesterday. An investigation into the potential exposure is ongoing by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS).\nCase Information\nMissouri DHSS reports that the patient, who was hospitalized, had underlying medical conditions, was treated with influenza antiviral medications, subsequently discharged, and has recovered. There is no immediate known animal exposure. No ongoing transmission among close contacts or otherwise has been identified.\nThis is the 14 th human case of H5 reported in the United States during 2024 and the first case of H5 without a known occupational exposure to sick or infected animals. H5 outbreaks in cattle have not been reported in Missouri, but outbreaks of H5 have been reported in commercial and backyard poultry flocks in 2024. H5N1 bird flu has been detected in wild birds in that state in the past.\nWhile other novel flu cases have been detected through the country's national flu surveillance system, this is the first time that system has detected a case of H5. Targeted H5-outbreak specific surveillance has been conducted as part of ongoing animal outbreaks and has identified all the other cases. In this case, the specimen from the patient originally tested positive for flu A, but negative for seasonal flu A virus subtypes. That finding triggers additional testing.\nCDC continues to closely monitor available data from influenza surveillance systems , particularly in affected states, and there has been no sign of unusual influenza activity in people, including in Missouri.\nIdentification of the neuraminidase (the \"N\") in the patient specimen is pending further sequencing. Attempts to sequence the genome of the virus also are underway at CDC.\nBased on available data, CDC's current assessment is that the risk to the general public from H5N1 remains low. CDC's recommendations related to H5 virus have not changed at this time. As always, circumstances may change quickly as more information is learned. The results of this investigation will be particularly important in light of the current lack of an obvious animal exposure. It is important to note that, while rare, there have been novel influenza A cases where an animal source cannot be identified. The main concern in these situations is that no onward transmission is occurring. Findings from the ongoing investigation will inform whether guidance changes are needed."

    "title": "New CDC Report Shows Suicide Risk Tied to Local Economic and Social Conditions",
    "date": "2025-08-21",
    "content": "A new CDC Vital Signs report released today highlights the role that conditions in counties, such as insurance coverage, broadband internet access, and household income, can play in lowering suicide risk. Compared to counties with the lowest levels of these factors, suicide rates were:\n26% lower in counties with the highest health insurance coverage\n44% lower in counties where most homes have broadband internet access\n13% lower in counties with the most household income\nThese findings reinforce other studies that show that the conditions where people are born, grow, live, work, and age can play an important role in shaping suicide prevention efforts.\nSuicide rates have increased during the last 20 years and remain high. Tragically, more than 49,000 people died by suicide in 2022, and provisional data indicate a similar number of people died by suicide in 2023.\nSuicide is the second leading cause of death for people ages 10-34, and other groups continue to have high rates: American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons (27.1 per 100,000), males (23.0 per 100,000), rural residents (20.0 per 100,000), and people aged 45-64 (19 per 100,000).\nThis latest Vital Signs also explores the association of these three factors with suicide rates overall, and what these relationships look like in groups most affected by suicide-- all to help inform suicide prevention programs in communities across the country.\nPreventing suicide requires multiple interventions. This Vital Signs report stresses the importance of a comprehensive approach to prevent suicide in the first place, and support people at increased risk. Improving conditions in communities can include strengthening household financial security so people can afford food, housing, and medical expenses; fostering healthy connections through community engagement that build social networks; and increasing healthcare provider availability and rapid and remote access to telehealth, mental health services, and crisis intervention, especially in underserved areas.\nCDC continues to take action to prevent suicide by:\nProviding data systems, scientific and technical expertise, strong collaboration, and funding to state health departments, tribes and tribal organizations, territories, academic institutions, and other local coalitions and organizations to help prevent suicide.\nFunding 28 programs around the country to carry out comprehensive suicide prevention programs using proven strategies from CDC's Suicide Prevention Resource for Action . These strategies are focused on populations most affected by suicide.\nSupporting rapid response in communities to investigate unexpected increases in suicides in a particular location and/or over a certain time frame. These events, known as suicide clusters, often require emergency assistance from CDC experts rapidly deployed to states, tribes, and communities.\nEveryone can help prevent suicide by learning the warning signs, promoting prevention and resilience, and committing to social change. Watch for the signs of increased suicide risk, such as isolation, loss, mental illness, and substance use. Act with these five steps to help save the life of someone who may be suicidal: Ask, Be There, Keep Them Safe, Help Them Connect, and Follow Up. Share resources from CDC and the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline public participation site.\nRead more about what can be done to reduce suicide in the recent National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and accompanying Federal Action Plan ."

    "date": "2024-09-16",
    "content": "Please Note: This transcript is not edited and may contain errors.\nModerator - 00:31\nThank you all for joining us today as we release a new CDC vital signs report. We are joined by Dr. Debra Houry, CDC, Deputy Director for Programming Science and Chief Medical Officer and Dr. Alison Cammack, lead author and Health Scientist on CDC Suicide Prevention Team. Following opening remarks, we will be joined by Dr. Deborah Stone, CDC, Lead Behavioral Scientist for Suicide Prevention to take your questions. Please note that this briefing is embargoed until 1pm Eastern, when our vital signs is live on the CDC website. I will now turn the call over to Dr. Houry.\nDr. Debra Houry 01:11\nHello and thank you for joining us today. This issue of CDC vital signs focuses on suicide rates in the US with an in depth look at how three community factors can influence a person's risk of suicide. Today's release is particularly timely, as September is Suicide Prevention Month, and today is World Suicide Prevention Day, a day where we raise awareness and attention to this issue, emphasizing the message that suicide is preventable. Often, suicide prevention focuses on helping people who are in crisis, while this is critically important, CDC approach to suicide prevention is to increase factors that promote resilience and to reduce factors that increase suicide risk, to keep people from ever getting to a crisis. This new report is an example of CDC work and suicide prevention as it explores community factors that can be improved to help protect people from suicide. Our vital signs study found that health insurance coverage, broadband Internet access, and higher income levels may impact suicide risk. CDC's comprehensive suicide prevention program which invests in 28 sites across the US specifically works to improve the conditions where people are born, grow, work, live and age to reduce suicide risk. CDC also funds and supports organizations working with tribes, veterans and others to prevent suicide. Let's look at this heartbreaking issue a bit more. Suicide rates have increased over the last 20 years and remain high. More than 49,000 people died by suicide in 2022 and provisional data indicate a similar number of people died by suicide in 2023. Suicide and suicide attempts also have serious emotional, physical and economic impacts on people and the communities they live in. We all likely know someone who has struggled with suicidal thoughts, I lost two medical school classmates to suicide, and know how this crisis can truly impact anyone and everyone. Some groups have higher suicide rates than others. For example, males have higher suicide rates than women. Rural communities have higher rates of suicide than urban communities, and the highest suicide rates are among non Hispanic, American Indian, Alaska Native people, followed by non Hispanic white people. So bottom line, today's vital signs report shows an association between health insurance coverage, broadband Internet access and household income and counties with suicide rates. I'll now pass it over to Dr Alison Cammack, the study's lead author, to go over the specific findings of this report.\nDr. Alison Cammack 04:14\nThank you, Dr Houry. Today's vital signs describes how county level factors are related to 2022 suicide rates in the United States. This new report found that suicide rates were lowest in counties with higher levels of health insurance coverage, broadband Internet access and household income. More specifically, suicide rates were 26% lower in counties where the most people have health insurance coverage compared to counties that have the least health insurance coverage. In counties where the most households have broadband Internet access, suicide rates were 44% lower than in counties that have the least accessed and finally, suicide rates were 13% lower in counties with the most household income compared. Counties with the lowest household income levels, these factors were more strongly associated with suicide rates in some groups of people, including American Indian and Alaska Native people. Suicide rates for American Indian and Alaska Native people in counties with the highest percentages of these three factors were half the rate of counties with the lowest percentage of these three factors. There may be many reasons why counties have lower suicide rates when they have higher levels of health insurance coverage, broadband Internet access and income. We know that these three factors are linked with protective factors that have been shown to help reduce the risk of suicide. Health insurance coverage can help people access mental health and primary care services and treatment. High Speed Internet access connects people to prevention resources, job opportunities, telehealth services and friends and family. Household financial resources such as income and economic supports put in place by local, state and federal governments can help families secure food, housing, healthcare and other basic needs. This report also found that certain groups of people continue to have higher rates of suicide, including males, rural residents, American Indian Alaska, native people and white people. It is important to note that many barriers challenge a person's ability to access health insurance, broadband internet and higher income. For example, tribal and rural communities may lack the infrastructure to obtain internet access. It's imperative that our nation works towards a comprehensive suicide prevention approach focused on programs, practices and policies designed to prevent suicide crises before they happen. And now I'll turn it back over to Dr. Houry to discuss how we can work together on a comprehensive approach to suicide prevention.\nDr. Debra Houry 06:54\nThank you. Dr. Cammack. In suicide prevention, CDC brings unique and unparalleled data systems, scientific and technical expertise and strong collaboration and funding support. This helps fund programs in state, health departments, tribes and tribal organizations, territories, academic institutions and other local coalitions and organizations. For example, with this report, CDC, experts are providing these data to inform action. A better understanding of suicide risk and protective factors, particularly in groups most affected by suicide, can improve suicide prevention efforts and save more lives. We offer proven actions for communities and organizations and our Suicide Prevention Resource for action, which you can find on CDC website. Examples of these actions include promoting healthy connections through school based programs, as well as programs that improve household access to financial security. And we incorporate our work with the solid foundation for positive change that already exists, such as traditions, cultural identities and connections to people and organizations. CDC co led development of the 2024 national suicide prevention strategy, which seeks to prevent suicide risk in the first place by under by addressing underlying factors, such as those described in the vital signs identifying and supporting individuals at increased risk through treatment and crisis intervention, preventing reattempts, promoting long term recovery and providing support to survivors of suicide loss. It's important for everyone to recognize the warning signs of increased suicide risk, including expressing hopelessness, being isolated, sleeping too little or too much and increased substance use. Help is available if you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of self harm or suicide, you can contact the 988 lifeline or use their online lifeline crisis chat. Help is free, confidential and available 24/7. We want to help people in need before a crisis occurs. Suicide is preventable, and we know what works to stop it and to spare families and friends from losing loved ones. Thank you for your time. Today, I will now open it up for questions.\nModerator 09:21\nThank you. We're ready for questions.\nOperator 09:25\nIf you would like to ask a question over the phone, please press star followed by one. Please make sure that your phone is unmuted and record your name clearly when prompted. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Please allow a moment for questions to come in. Thank you.\nOperator 09:59\nApplause. Our first question comes from Mike. Stobbie be with the Associated Press. Your line is open.\nMike Stobbe – Associated Press 10:16\nHi. Thanks for doing this call and for taking my question. I have two if I if I may. One is, could you say a little bit more about the 2023 provisional suicide data, like exactly how many suicide deaths were recorded, and were there any trends up or down that were notable regarding method or demographics or anything that differed from earlier years, and my second question was, about this report. Is it correct that the findings weren't consistent through all demographic groups, like for women or among females or for black persons regarding health insurance coverage. Could you speak a little bit to the uniformity of the findings and why there were differences?\nDr. Alison Cammack 11:13\nThis is Dr. Cammack. Regarding the provisional data. So we get our provisional data and it's updated on a weekly basis. And the last time I checked for 2023 it was at 49315, which as Dr. Houry stated, is pretty similar to the number that we saw last year. We haven't really looked at it in detail by trends yet, so I don't really want to comment on that. With regard to your second question about differences that we saw across demographic groups? Yes, we did see some differences. Most notably, we saw the associations between the various county level factors and suicide rates. They were most consistent and strongest among American Indian, Alaska Native persons, males, white persons and individuals between the ages of 25 and through 44 and there could be various different reasons for this. We don't know the exact reason, but I will say that we do know from other studies that there seem to be stronger associations among males and American Indian Alaska Native persons. When you look at economic factors more broadly and in terms of the groups that we didn't necessarily see strong associations again, we don't know the exact reason, but it's possible that there just might be other types of risk factors that are more salient in those groups.\nOperator 12:32\nOur next question comes from Kirsten Dorman with KJZZ, NPR, your line is open.\nKirsten Dorman – KJZZ, NPR\nHi. Thanks so much again for having us, and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if there was any further insights you can offer regarding any kind of potential link observed between or any notable trends regarding broadband Internet access and suicide prevention.\nDr. Alison Cammack 13:05\nThis is Dr. Cammack. Can you clarify? Just you want to understand more about why we might see this association.\nKirsten Dorman – KJZZ, NPR\nSure, yes, and why it's brought up in regard to, you know, rural communities and these different kind of demographics,\nDr. Alison Cammack 13:19\nSo we brought up, you know, the relevance for different demographic groups, because we know, like rural communities and tribal communities, they have less access to broadband internet. So it might be particularly important to see these associations within these groups. And to reiterate my earlier point, we did find particularly for American Indian Alaska Native persons, we saw all three factors, including broadband internet, that having higher levels of broadband was associated with lower suicide rates, so it was particularly salient in that group.\nOperator 13:53\nThank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Eden Brown with Fox News, your line is open.\nEden Brown – Fox News 14:02\nI thank you for taking the call today. My question for whoever would like to answer is, what would the action items be on these data findings. What would you expect policy makers to do? There have been a number of initiatives to wire up rural America for high speed internet to do so on Native American territories, to provide subsidized internet service in urban, rural air, excuse me, in urban, lower income areas. So there seems to be a lot of both the federal and even many state level initiatives to address that disparity, and I guess, services, but you're kind of putting another call it a dimension to it, to say that this could be saving lives, or perhaps you're saying it's the lack of the service is putting lives at risk. I'm not quite sure. But what would you want to you know, a. Legislature, either at a state level or the Congress, to do with your data here.\nDr. Debra Houry 15:05\nThanks. This is Dr Houry and a really important question. I would say, really developing programs and policies that improve housing stability, economic security, connection to community, Internet access and healthcare access and delivery are what this vital signs, and a lot of our other work has shown these are community level conditions with policies that can save lives.\nModerator 15:34\nMissy, we have time for a couple more.\nOperator 15:36\nNext question comes from Eve Bender with Medscape, medical news, your line is open.\nEve Bender - Medscape 15:43\nHi, thank you for taking my question. I'm wondering if the CDC has a stamp on universal suicide screening.\nDr. Debra Houry 15:57\nWe don't have a policy on that. But what I would say is in general, you know, this is why we focus on community level interventions, because any life lost is too many. Our work really focuses on those that are at risk for suicide, so that we can support those to get services and really raising awareness, which is one of the reasons why we have this vital signs, and why I also think it's important when media report to really report on things to look for and how to get care, and 988 because I think just as important about having identification of those at risk for suicide is that we report on how we can respond to suicide, so that we aren't having clusters or I would say, you know, making it more newsy than we want it to be. We really want suicide deaths to be viewed seriously as something that's preventable, something that can be done, and that people know that it is preventable and that there is hope and help. So that is really our focus is on really community level interventions and focusing on those at risk.\nModerator 17:09\nOur last question please,\nOperator 17:10\nThank you. Our last question comes from Eduardo Cuevas with the USA Today your line is open.\nEduardo Cuevas – USA Today 17:18\nHi. Thank you for having us. Really appreciate the study. I wanted to ask, you know, looking at these three factors, health insurance, broadband internet, household income, how I was curious, how you view this study? Looking at, I guess, how does it look at maybe, individual factors around someone in Crisis or someone with mental health illness versus societal factors that contribute to suicide deaths. Thank you.\nDr. Alison Cammack 17:54\nHi. This is Dr. Cammack, so in this study, we didn't focus on any individual factors, and we actually didn't look at that other than just looking at the different demographic groups. When we looked at the relationship between the three different county level factors and suicide rates, looking, you know, for differences in that relationship. But we didn't look at individual factors by themselves.\nDr. Debra Houry 18:18\nAnd this is Dr Houry. I think what I would just add, not necessarily in relation to that question, but just overall, is, you know, these numbers are staggering. One life lost is too many. And sometimes it might seem overwhelming like is there more we could be doing? And certainly, I think focusing on this issue is very important. But what we know what to do works, and some of the things that we're highlighting in this vital signs today are what works, and I'm really proud of our CDC programs in the areas to where we have had funding. We've seen that our recipients that we've seen decreases in veteran suicide deaths by 6% when there was actually an increase in this population, and we saw a decrease in suicide among youth served by our suicide prevention sites when the national rate decreased by about half of that so by doing what works, we can have an impact, and I hope that that is what the take home message is, that we can all make a difference by implementing these community level prevention programs and identifying the warning signs, we can all save a life.\nModerator 19:23\nWe'd like to thank you all for joining us today. If you have follow up questions, please call this main press office at 404-639-3286 or you can email media@cdc.gov This will conclude our call. Thank you. Applause."

    "date": "2024-11-01",
    "content": "New CDC population data from 2023 show that in 23 states more than one in three adults (35%) has obesity. Before 2013, no state had an adult obesity prevalence at or above 35%. Currently, at least one in five adults (20%) in each U.S. state is living with obesity.\n\"This new data highlight the need for obesity prevention and treatment options, which start with building healthier communities where people of all ages have safe places for physical activity, and where health care and healthy food options are accessible and affordable for all,\" said Karen Hacker, MD, MPH, director of CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. \"Obesity prevention at young ages is critical, because we know that children with obesity often become adults with obesity. This is one of the reasons why we prioritize state and community investments in effective child care and family healthy weight programs .\"\nThe 23 states with the highest adult obesity rates (35% or higher) include: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Guam and Puerto Rico also had an obesity rate of at least 35%. State-based adult obesity prevalence by race, ethnicity, and location uses self-reported height and weight data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).\nObesity impacts some groups more than others. There are notable differences by race and ethnicity, as shown by combined BRFSS data from 2021–2023.\nAsian adults do not have an obesity prevalence at or above 35% in any state (among 37 states, 1 territory, and DC).\nIn 16 states, White adults have an obesity prevalence at or above 35% (among 47 states, 2 territories, and DC).\nIn 30 states, American Indian or Alaska Native adults have an obesity prevalence at or above 35% (among 44 states).\nIn 34 states, Hispanic adults have an obesity prevalence at or above 35% (among 47 states, 3 territories, and DC).\nIn 38 states, Black adults have an obesity prevalence at or above 35% (among 46 states, 1 territory, and DC).\n\"Obesity is a complex disease. There's a common misconception that obesity is a result of lack of willpower and individual failings to eat well and exercise,\" said Ruth Petersen, MD, director of CDC's Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity. \"Many factors contribute to obesity like genes, certain medications, poor sleep, gut microbiome, stress, access to affordable food, safe places to be active, and access to health care. Understanding these factors helps us identify potential prevention and treatment strategies.\"\nCDC partners with communities, states, and tribes to help improve health and reduce obesity among populations with the highest risk, or burden, of chronic diseases across the country. CDC invests in programs like SPAN , HOP , and REACH to help increase access to healthy food options, establish safe and accessible places for physical activity, and promote stigma-free obesity prevention and treatment programs. These programs fund 17 states, 50 community and tribal organizations, and 16 land grant universities.\nObesity treatment can also include obesity medications, such as GLP-1s recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, combined with health behavior and lifestyle interventions.\nAn adult with obesity has a body mass index of 30 or higher. Obesity is a disease that can cause many health conditions such as asthma, heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, some cancers, and severe outcomes from respiratory illnesses. In addition, the stigma and bias about a person's weight can cause social and mental health consequences, such as anxiety and poor body image."

    "date": "2024-09-25",
    "content": "Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced more than $176 million in funding to support 48 public health partners to strengthen the public health system in the United States. This funding enables these partners to support state, local, and territorial health departments, tribal organizations, academic, and private sector partners to improve their ability to serve the public and positively impact health outcomes. Recipients span various sectors, public health specialties, and population groups, bringing diverse expertise needed across public health.\n\"CDC's public health partners are critical to building trust with communities and providing the essential services and capacity needed to face health threats,\" said CDC Director Mandy Cohen, M.D., M.P.H. \"Today's announcement demonstrates the agency's commitment to building the strong, resilient public health system the nation needs to protect health and save lives.\"\nAs part of the National Partners Cooperative Agreement, the recipient organizations will receive the $176 million in funding for the first year of a 5-year-cycle. This funding will help partners increase the knowledge, skill, and ability of the public health workforce to deliver essential services, improve organizational and systems capacity and capability building to address health priorities, and advance the nation's public health infrastructure and performance.\n\"By working together with our valued partners, we can build a resilient public health system capable of addressing evolving challenges,\" said Leslie Ann Dauphin, PhD, Director of CDC's Public Health Infrastructure Center. \"These awards will help build a strong public health infrastructure with enhanced ability to detect and control diseases, promote healthy lifestyles, and provide essential healthcare services to all communities.\"\nCDC's goal with the National Partners Cooperative Agreement is to fund organizations that have the capability, expertise, resources, and national reach to support public health infrastructure and workforce needs. The funding mechanism began in 2008 and since that time, CDC has awarded more than $2.5 billion in funding to more than 70 public health partners. CDC continues to collaborate with a wide variety of important partners, both funded and unfunded.\nPrevious recipients used National Partners Cooperative Agreement funds to support various public health initiatives, such as:\nDeveloping a rural public health curriculum for public health professionals and students interested in improving their skills in rural public health competencies (e.g., social determinants of health in rural communities and finding solutions to rural health disparities).\nStrengthening the infrastructure and capacity of state, territorial, and local health departments to investigate, analyze, and share data on drug overdoses to enhance surveillance efforts.\nCreating a tool and best practices to help community-serving organizations work with schools and parents to improve comprehensive support for adolescent mental health.\nThe United States' public health system is most effective when the federal government teams up with partner organizations to address emerging outbreaks and other natural or man-made disasters. About 80% of CDC's annual domestic budget goes to external partners. Public health partners have the reach, influence, access, and capabilities to coordinate an effective public health response and strengthen public health systems and services. A key role for public health partners is to provide capacity-building assistance to ensure a capable and efficient public health system and workforce.

Throw them away or contact stores about returns.\nPeople who are at higher risk for getting sick with Listeria, such as those who are pregnant, are aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system, should always avoid eating meats sliced at deli counters, unless heated to an internal temperature of 165°F or until steaming hot just before serving.\nClean your refrigerator, containers, and surfaces that may have touched sliced deli meats.\nCall your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of Listeria and recently ate meats sliced at deli counters.\nBusinesses that received recalled meats should take extra precautions like cleaning and sanitizing and throwing away opened sliced meats and cheeses at delis. Businesses should also follow USDA-FSIS best practices for controlling Listeria contamination in deli areas.\nAbout Listeria :\nListeria can cause severe illness (known as invasive listeriosis) when the bacteria spread beyond the gut to other parts of the body.\nPregnant people typically experience only fever, fatigue, and muscle aches. However, Listeria infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or life-threating infection of the newborn.\nPeople who are not pregnant may experience headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions, in addition to fever and muscle aches.\nSymptoms of severe illness usually start 1 to 4 weeks after eating contaminated food with Listeria but may start as early as the same day or as late as 70 days after.\nIf you have questions about cases in a particular state, please call that state's health department.\nThank you,\nCDC Media Support Branch 404-639-3286 Media@cdc.gov"

On September 30, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced an indictment against individuals running illegal online pharmacies. According to the DOJ, these individuals are advertising, selling, manufacturing, and shipping millions of unregulated counterfeit prescription pills to tens of thousands of individuals in the U.S. The counterfeit pills frequently contain fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is up to 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine, and methamphetamine. Individuals who ordered drugs from these illegal pharmacies could be at risk for an overdose.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns that there are online pharmacies that claim to sell prescription drugs at deeply discounted prices, often without requiring a prescription. These internet-based pharmacies often sell unapproved, counterfeit, or otherwise unsafe medicines outside the safeguards followed by licensed pharmacies. Individuals should only take medications prescribed by a licensed healthcare provider and dispensed by a licensed pharmacy.\nAccording to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, nearly 95% of websites offering prescription-only drugs online operate illegally.\nIf you or someone you know has purchased pills from an online pharmacy:\nCheck to see if the pharmacy is U.S. state-licensed. Locate a State-Licensed Online Pharmacy | FDA . If you have obtained medications from a pharmacy that is not U.S. state-licensed, do not consume the medication.\nIf you suspect you have counterfeit pills from an illegal online pharmacy, do not take them. Dispose of them safely . Beware of online pharmacies that: Do not require a doctor's prescription. Are not licensed in the U.S. and by your state board of pharmacy.

    "title": "CDC Confirms New Human Cases of H5 Bird Flu in California",
    "date": "2025-03-03",
    "content": "October 3, 2024 - CDC has confirmed two human cases of H5 bird flu from specimens submitted by California. The cases occurred in people with occupational exposure to infected dairy cows. An investigation led by California is ongoing. The identification of H5 in people with exposure to infected animals is not unexpected and does not change CDC's risk assessment for the general public, which continues to be low. At this time, there is no known link or contact between the first and second confirmed cases in California, suggesting these are separate instances of animal-to-human spread of the virus. CDC continues to collaborate closely with California and other state public health officials to support state-run efforts to control the spread of H5N1 from infected animals to humans; California's active monitoring highlights the steps being taken at the state level to lower the risk to farm workers who may be in contact with animals with H5N1.In the coming days, CDC will conduct additional characterization of the viruses, including sequencing, isolating and growing the viruses, if possible.\nThese are the first human cases of H5 in California, where H5N1 outbreaks among dairy herds were first reported in August 2024. H5N1 bird flu was detected for the first time in cows this year in the United States. The virus is widespread in wild birds and has caused ongoing outbreaks among poultry in the United States since 2022. It has caused rare, sporadic infections in people who work with infected animals, such as dairy cow workers and poultry workers. Including this most recent case, 16 human cases of H5 have been reported in the United States during 2024, bringing the total to 17 cases since 2022. Cases during 2024 have been reported in Texas (1), Michigan (2), Colorado (10), Missouri (1) and California (2). Six of the 16 reported human cases have been linked to exposure to sick or infected dairy cows. Nine cases had exposure to infected poultry. The source of infection for the one case in Missouri has not been determined. Serologic testing of contacts of the case in Missouri is ongoing. CDC has recommendations to protect people against H5N1 bird flu in dairy cattle. These include avoiding contact with wild birds and sick or dead animals and not preparing or eating unpasteurized (raw) milk or raw cheese. If you work with dairy cows or other animals that could be infected with H5N1 bird flu, wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when in contact with (or around) dairy cows, raw milk, other animals, or surfaces and other items that might be contaminated with virus. CDC recently issued updated personal protective equipment guidance (PPE) to prevent H5N1 bird flu infection.\nCDC recommends that if you get sick after close contact with infected animals, contact your local health department and a health care provider for testing. Symptoms of H5 include eye redness (conjunctivitis), mild flu-like upper respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, sore throat, difficulty breathing, runny or stuffy nose, and muscle aches."

    "date": "2025-03-03",
    "content": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed a third human case of H5 bird flu in California. Like the two cases in that state confirmed last week, the person reported occupational exposure to infected dairy cows. To date, all three California cases occurred in dairy workers from three different affected farms with no known contact with each other, suggesting animal-to-human spread. Also consistent with the two previous California cases, the person experienced mild symptoms, including eye redness or discharge (conjunctivitis). None of the three cases has been hospitalized. The identification of H5 in people with exposure to infected animals is not unexpected and does not change CDC's risk assessment for the general public, which continues to be low.\nIncluding this most recent case, 18 human cases of H5 bird flu have now been reported in the United States since 2022; 17 cases during 2024. CDC is awaiting 2 additional presumptive positive specimens from California for confirmatory testing.\nCDC Lab Update on First Two California Cases\nSequences from the first two cases in California confirmed these are clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) viruses closely related to viruses detected in dairy cattle. The whole genome was sequenced from one of the two cases (A/California/135/2024) and was confirmed to be a B3.13 genotype virus. There were no genetic changes observed that are known to be associated with an increased ability to infect or spread between people or known to reduce susceptibility to antiviral medications. These sequences have been publicly posted in GISAID and have been submitted to GenBank . Sequencing from the third confirmed case is underway.\nCDC continues to underscore the importance of recommended precautions for people with exposure to infected or potentially infected animals. People with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection."

    "title": "Youth Tobacco Product Use at a 25-Year Low, Yet Disparities Persist",
    "date": "2024-10-21",
    "content": "October 17, 2024 – Current tobacco product use among U.S. middle and high school students has dropped to the lowest recorded level in 25 years. This is according to newly released data from the 2024 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS). Within the past year alone, at least half a million fewer students are using tobacco products, contributing to this important progress.\nIn 2024, 2.25 million middle and high school students reported current use (use on one or more days during the past 30 days) of any tobacco product, compared to 2.80 million in 2023. This decline was largely attributable to the significant drop in the number of students who reported current e-cigarette use (2.13 million youth in 2023 compared to 1.63 million youth in 2024). Within the past year, a significant decline also occurred in current hookah use (290,000 in 2023 compared to 190,000 in 2024). Cigarette smoking reached the lowest level ever recorded by the survey, with only 1.4% of students reporting current use in 2024.\n\"Reaching a 25-year low for youth tobacco product use is an extraordinary milestone for public health. However, with more than 2 million youth using tobacco products and certain groups not experiencing declines in use, our mission is far from complete,\" said Deirdre Lawrence Kittner, Ph.D., M.P.H., director of CDC's Office on Smoking and Health. \"We must remain committed to public health efforts to ensure all youth can live healthy, tobacco-free lives.\"\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analyzed NYTS data to assess the use of nine tobacco products among U.S. middle school (grades 6–8) and high school (grades 9–12) students. Detailed information on use of e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches from the 2024 NYTS was recently published . Today's release provides further data from the survey, including findings on other types of tobacco product use and detailed breakdowns of tobacco product use by school level, sex and race and ethnicity.\nYouth e-cigarette use declined to the lowest level in a decade; however, for the 11th year in a row, e-cigarettes remained the most commonly used tobacco product (5.9%) among youth who reported current tobacco product use. In 2024, nicotine pouches became the second most commonly used tobacco product among youth (1.8%), followed by cigarettes (1.4%), cigars (1.2%), smokeless tobacco (1.2%), other oral nicotine products (1.2%), heated tobacco products (0.8%), hookahs (0.7%) and pipe tobacco (0.5%).\nThe report also found varying progress across population groups. For example, during 2023-2024, current use of any tobacco product, e-cigarettes and multiple tobacco products all significantly declined among female students, and current use of any tobacco product, e-cigarettes, cigars, hookahs and multiple tobacco products declined among Hispanic students. In contrast, during 2023-2024, current use of any tobacco product, e-cigarettes, oral nicotine products, any combustible tobacco product and multiple tobacco products all increased among American Indian or Alaska Native students, and current use of nicotine pouches increased among White students. No significant changes occurred in current use of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, heated tobacco products and pipe tobacco for all assessed race and ethnicity groups.\n\"We're headed in the right direction when it comes to reducing tobacco product use among our nation's youth,\" said Brian King, Ph.D., M.P.H., director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products. \"But we can't take our foot off the gas. Continued vigilance is needed to continue to reduce all forms of tobacco product use among youth. Addressing disparities remains an essential part of these efforts to ensure that we don't leave anyone behind.\"\nThe observed decline in tobacco product use is likely the result of multiple factors, including the implementation of evidence-based strategies at the national, state and local levels. Evidence-based tobacco prevention strategies include price increases, mass media campaigns to educate youth about the harmful effects of all tobacco products, and comprehensive smoke-free policies that include e-cigarettes. The FDA also continues to regulate the tobacco product marketplace by conducting thorough premarket review and using the full scope of its compliance and enforcement tools across the supply chain – including manufacturers, importers, distributors and retailers.\nUse of tobacco products in any form is unsafe, and nearly all tobacco product use begins during adolescence. Given the negative health consequences of tobacco use and the unique harms associated with adolescent nicotine exposure, preventing youth tobacco product use is imperative. Efforts aimed at reducing youth tobacco product use and related disparities are also a critical part of tobacco prevention and control efforts.\nTo learn more about preventing youth tobacco product use and supporting young people to quit, visit:\nE-Cigarettes (Vapes) | Smoking and Tobacco Use | CDC\nYouth and Tobacco Use | Smoking and Tobacco Use | CDC\nThe Real Cost Campaign | FDA\nVaping Prevention Resources | HHS.gov\nSmokefree Teen | National Cancer Institute"

These updated recommendations also allow for flexibility for additional doses (i.e., three or more) for those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised, in consultation with their healthcare provider (a strategy known as shared clinical decision making ).\nThe recommendation acknowledges the increased risk of severe disease from COVID-19 in older adults and those who are immunocompromised, along with the currently available data on vaccine effectiveness and year-round circulation of COVID-19. The recommendation also provides clarity to healthcare providers on how many doses should be given per year to people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised and is meant to increase coverage of this second dose for that group.\nData continues to confirm the importance of vaccination to protect those most at risk for severe outcomes of COVID-19. Receiving recommended 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccines can restore and enhance protection against the virus variants currently responsible for most infections and hospitalizations in the United States. COVID-19 vaccination also reduces the chance of suffering the effects of Long COVID, which can develop during or following acute infection and last for an extended duration.\nCDC and ACIP will continue to monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness. CDC continues to recommend that everyone stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines , especially people ages 65 years and older and those with weakened immune systems .\nFor more information on updated COVID-19 vaccines visit: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) | CDC .\nThe following statement is attributable to CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen:\n\"This vote allows people to make the best decisions possible to keep themselves and their loved ones safe from COVID-19.

    "date": "2024-11-01",
    "content": "The CDC and the Iowa Department of Health are investigating a suspected case of Lassa fever, which was diagnosed today in an Iowa resident who returned to the United States from West Africa early this month. The patient was not sick while traveling so the risk to fellow airline passengers is extremely low. The patient was hospitalized in isolation at the University of Iowa Health Care Medical Center when they died earlier this afternoon. Testing by the Nebraska Laboratory Response Network lab early this morning found the illness was presumptively positive for Lassa fever and confirmatory testing is planned.\nLassa fever is a viral disease common in West Africa, but rarely seen in the United States. In West Africa, Lassa virus is carried by rodents and spread to humans through contact with urine or droppings of infected rodents. In rare cases, it can be transmitted from person to person through direct contact with a sick person's blood or body fluids, through mucous membranes, or through sexual contact. The virus is not spread through casual contact, and patients are not believed to be infectious before symptoms begin. About 100,000 to 300,000 cases of Lassa fever, and 5,000 deaths related to Lassa fever, occur in West Africa each year.\nIf confirmed, the Iowa suspected case would be the ninth known occurrence since 1969 of Lassa fever in travelers returning to the United States from areas where Lassa fever is commonly found.\nCDC is supporting state and local public health officials from Iowa who are working to learn more about how the patient may have contracted Lassa fever. Early information suggests the patient may have had contact with rodents while in West Africa. CDC and other federal agencies have offered federal assistance to Iowa. People with Lassa fever can only transmit the illness when they have active symptoms and CDC is working with state public health officials to identify people who had contact with the patient after the patient's symptoms began. Those identified as close contacts of the patient will be monitored for 21 days.\nAdditional information will be shared as we learn more about this patient.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Benjamin Haynes, thank you, maybe again.\nModerator - 00:23\nThank you Courtney, and thank you all for joining us today as we release a new MMWR and updated CDC guidance on the H5N1 bird flu outbreaks. We're joined today by Dr. Demetre C. Daskalakis, Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and CDC Principal Deputy Director, Dr. Nirav Shah, I'd like to remind everybody that this briefing is embargoed until 1pm Eastern, when our MMWR goes live on the CDC website. I'll now turn the call over to Dr Daskalakis.\nDr. Demetre C. Daskalakis - 00:58\nThank you and good morning everyone. I will first provide an update on H5 cases in the United States. Then we'll share some findings that are being published in an MMWR later today. So first, the situation overview. To date, there have been 46 human cases of H5 in the US, in 2024 25 cases were due to the ongoing outbreak in dairy cows. 20, which of which are 21, of which are in California. 20 cases are due to poultry depopulation, including the 11 recent cases from Washington State. Additionally, there is one case in Missouri with no known animal or animal product exposure. CDC continues to assess the risk to the general population is low. Efforts to protect people with exposure to animals or animal products affected by H5 continues to be a key focus of our public health activities. I'd like to now share the results of an important study focused on workers that will be published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report later today, or MMWR. So this is the Michigan Colorado dairy worker survey, CDC, coordinated with state health departments in Michigan and Colorado to conduct an anonymized serosurvey among dairy workers exposed to dairy cows infected with H5N1 influenza A. So as a reminder, a serosurvey is a collection and testing of blood from a defined population. In this case, dairy farm workers to estimate the prevalence of antibodies against an infectious pathogen, in this case, H5N1, as an indicator of possible exposure prevalence or immunity. The purpose of the serosurvey was to expand our understanding of the extent of infections among exposed dairy farm worker workers, how these infections related to symptoms experienced by participants, and what activities or actions were associated with infection. Blood samples were collected from June to August 2024 from 115 people who worked on dairy farms in Michigan and Colorado with cows that were confirmed positive for H5 virus. 35 of the people included in this serosurvey had results previously reported earlier this summer, and as a reminder, there were dairy farm workers from Michigan and all tested negative for H5N1 antibodies. 80 additional people were recruited in Michigan and Colorado to increase the sample size of the serosurvey and provide more robust results. Samples were collected 15 to 90 days after H5N1 virus was identified in cows on the farm. Along with getting their blood drawn, individuals were interviewed to learn more about what they did on the farm, what protective measures they took, and whether they had been sick since cows on their farms had been diagnosed with H5N1 or quarantine. All samples were tested for antibodies against the H5N1 virus isolated from the first human case this year in Texas. And we also tested samples against a seasonal H5N1, virus as a positive control. So on to the results, eight of the 115 samples, that's 7% were seropositive against HPAI, or highly pathogenic avian influenza. The 2.3.4.4b A clade that we see circulating among dairy cows using two different antibody tests to be considered antibody or seropositive, both tests had to be positive using accepted criteria. Another lab protocol was also performed to remove seasonal influenza antibodies and to rule out that the positive H5N1 tests were due to cross reactivity related to these commonly circulated viruses. On to the specific results, 8 of the 115 people tested positive for H5N1 antibodies using this protocol of the seropositive individuals, four remembered having symptoms, mostly conjunctivitis. The other four did not among these four people, illnesses began prior to or shortly after identification of infected herds, more details of who was who had positive results. All eight were Spanish speakers. All eight reported milking cows or cleaning the milking parlor, supporting these as higher risk activities, none wore respiratory protection, and less than half were eye protection, highlighting the need for better tools to support worker protection. Only one person reported they worked with infected cows, despite the fact that they were working with cows on farms with known infection. One important limitation to the survey data is that the interviews were conducted on an average 49 days after the first exposure to infected cows with some workers interviewed up to 90 days after their first exposure. That makes recall of minor symptoms potentially difficult. Nevertheless, these data help us better understand the potential for infection with mild or no symptoms, as well as highlighting interventions that may help workers reduce their risk of exposure and infection with H5N1.\nI'll now hand the mic over to Dr. Shah, who will go into more details about actions that CDC is taking to further mitigate risk to people who work with animals and animal products potentially affected by H5N1 Dr Shah.\nDr. Nirav Shah - 06:05\nThank you, Dr Daskalakis, and good morning everyone. This is Nirav Shah from CDC, and I'm going to be discussing the steps that CDC is taking in light of the serology results that Dr Daskalakis just outlined. The purpose of these actions is to keep workers safe, to limit the transmission of H5N1 to humans and reduce the possibility of the virus changing right now. There are two principal ways that people in the United States are being infected with H5N1 via exposure to infected poultry during culling events, and via exposure to infected dairy cows during the milking process. What we are announcing today is an intensification of recommendations to focus on the highest exposure tasks in poultry and dairy operations, ultimately to reduce the risk of infection. We're doing so in three areas. Number one, expanding our recommendation for who should be tested for H5N1. Number two, a new recommendation for use of Tamiflu for exposed, asymptomatic workers. And then number three, focusing our PPE guidance for workers based on their risk of exposure coupled with additional training activities. So let's start with testing the serology data that Dr Daskalakis outlined show that there may be individuals who were infected with H5 but who do not recall having symptoms. That means that we in public health need to cast a wider net in terms of who is offered a test so that we can identify, treat and isolate those individuals. Now, previously, as part of an outbreak investigation, we focused on workers who were exposed and who had symptoms. Going forward, CDC is expanding our testing recommendation to include workers who were exposed and who do not have symptoms, particularly those workers who were exposed without having worn proper PPE. Again, we're expanding our recommendation to include workers who were exposed and who do not have symptoms, particularly those who were not wearing appropriate PPE. The purpose of this expansion, informed by the new serology data, is to actively identify exposed workers with H5, even if their symptoms are so mild as to be unnoticeable, so that those two that those workers too, can be offered treatment and isolation. This active case finding reduces the likelihood that a mild infection could turn into a severe infection, or that the infection spreads to anyone else. Simply put, the less room we give this virus to run, the fewer chances it has to cause harm or to change. And the best way to limit the virus's room to run is to test, identify, treat and isolate as many cases as possible in humans and as quickly as possible. Second, let's turn to our new recommendation for medication for exposed asymptomatic workers. A key part of our strategy is to offer treatment with Tamiflu to workers who were exposed and who show symptoms that are consistent with H5N1 infection, but in light of the data that Dr Daskalakis outlined, which showed again, the existence of individuals with mild or even no symptoms that they can remember, CDC now recommends offering Tamiflu to asymptomatic workers who had a high risk exposure to H5N1 animals without having worn adequate PPE. Again, we are expanding the scope of who CDC recommends Tamiflu for to include now workers who are asymptomatic, who had a high risk exposure to an H5N1 infected animal without having worn adequate PPE. So what's at high risk exposure? Well, that could include an unprotected splash in the face with raw cow milk or on the poultry setting, something that might have happened during a depopulation or culling event where the individual was not wearing appropriate PPE. Just as with our expanded testing recommendation, more widespread use of Tamiflu achieves several goals. Chief among them is to protect workers. It reduces the likelihood of an asymptomatic case being symptomatic because they're receiving Tamiflu, and thus, it lowers the risk and the chances of onward transmission to close contacts, and then the third thing is our focus on PPE guidance to farms and workers based on their risk level. CDC continues to focus on primary prevention strategies like PPE for workers with potential occupational exposures to animals or to animal products that are infected by H5 in light of the serology data. CDC is updating our PPE recommendations for workers based on their risk of workplace exposure going forward. CDC PPE recommendations will prioritize what PPE a farm worker should wear based on our data indicating which farm tasks present the highest risk for H5N1, exposure and infection, for example, culling operations or working in the milking parlor with sick or infected animals, simply put, the higher risk activities will call for more PPE use. CDC has developed additional resources to support training workers on PPE use and to explain its role in preventing H5N1 from animals infecting humans. CDC will continue to evaluate this situation and will update our guidance as needed. To close, what we've discussed today is an example of CDC using data to drive action. We will continue working with trusted partners to reach farm workers and their employers to communicate these prevention strategies as widely as possible. And then finally, before we open it up to questions, we will, we anticipate publishing a spotlight today that contains these updated recommendations. With that, we'll turn it over back to our team for questions.\nModerator 12:34\nThank you. Dr. Shah. We are now ready to open up for questions.\nOperator - 12:39\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one. If you need to withdraw your question, press star two. Again to ask a question, please press star one. Our first question comes from Brenda Goodman from CNN.\nBrenda Goodman – CNN - 12:58\nThank you so much for taking my question and congratulations on these studies, because I know you had some significant headwinds to get them done. I have a question about the eight workers, are they counted as cases now? Or will they be counted as cases in the human case count? And then I was curious. You gave an update at the beginning. Dr Daskalakis about how many human cases of H5 were associated with poultry depopulations this year. Why do you think we're so many seeing so many more human infections with poultry depopulation because we've had age five in poultry before, and I think we only had one case prior this year.\nDr. Demetre C. Daskalakis - 13:38\nGreat. Thank you for those questions. So on the first question, these retrospective serologies are not going to be reported as cases, so they are really looking retrospectively, helping us learn, but they're not going to be called cases. On the second question, I think there are a lot of reasons why we could potentially be seeing more human disease related to or human infections related to the culling operations. One is there's more H5, so that's probably one of the most important. Like both in wild birds as well as in poultry, we're seeing a significant increase, and the more the sort of H5 community viral load is high in animals, the more likely it is that humans will be exposed. I think the second is also that we, I think, have raised a lot of attention to carefully screening individuals with H5 exposure for even mild symptoms. So there could be that as well. In terms of other characteristics of the virus, we are not seeing any changes with the virus that would indicate ease of transmission. But given sort of our current environment, the sort of increasing experience with age five and one really creating strategies to better protect workers based on this data is, I think, the right thing to do at this time.\nOperator - 15:00\nOur next question comes from Megan Molteni from STAT\nMegan Molteni from STAT - 15:06\nThanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could clarify something that you said about only one of the persons who tested positive for antibodies reporting having worked with known infected cows, and it sounded like you were saying that that meant there was a need for more additional education. But could it also be that these animals that they're working with are asymptomatic, and so, you know, they're going through the milking parlors and they're not getting separated out into quarantine? Can you talk a bit about what we know about asymptomatic disease in the animal.\nDr. Demetre C. Daskalakis - 15:41\nGreat. Thank you. So. So I think that you put the nail on the head that this is really about about education and also self-assessment of risk, which I think is an important piece of both why one would wear post, why one would wear appropriate PPE as well as pursue post exposure prophylaxis. So these were farms with known infected cows, and so it was really about the fact that they didn't have the awareness that they had any sick cows that they were working with, even though they were in environments where sick cows were known. So it really speaks to the importance of more on farm training around H5 as well as ways to protect from H5\nMegan Molteni from STAT - 16:22\nOkay, thank you. Can you also just, very quickly, are there any more serology studies planned in other states, like thinking about California, given the number of herds we see there now.\nDr. Demetre C. Daskalakis - 16:33\nThank you for that question. So we are currently working, and I think we've, we've put this up on one of our prior spotlights on a serology study, a serosurvey, that is that was conducted it physically in Ohio, because there was a large convention of bovine practitioners, and so we about 150 of them provided blood samples as well as survey data. And we will update on those once they become available.\nOperator - 17:04\nOur next question comes from Josh Nathan-Kazis from Barrons.\nJosh Nathan-Kazis from Barrons - 17:08\nSorry. Thank you so much. Two quick questions. One, I wonder if you could have some context. I mean, how unexpected is it that there would be asymptomatic HVAC cases? That's something that's been seen before elsewhere. How much of a surprise of the finding and separately I saw in the MMWR says that 40% of the workers reported feeling ill while H5 was on their farm, although only a fraction of those actually had serological evidence of infection. I wonder, if you just talk about what might be going on there and why so many of the workers said they felt sick, even if their blood tests didn't say they were sick.\nDr. Demetre C. Daskalakis - 17:46\nThank you. So on the first question, I think that the only way to sort of take out surprises by doing the studies, which is why it's important that we have that information. But I think given the mildness of the symptoms that many people are presenting with, it's not a surprise that some people wouldn't recall symptoms up to 90 days after their exposure. So again, though not surprising, it actually is approximately in line with other serosurveys that have been conducted that focused on, on, again, this specific clade of H5N1, so a study that happened in workers, 2223 showed about 4.6% were seropositive, and about 14% as you recall from a pre print that UT Galveston Galveston put out in early 2024 also showed asymptomatic individuals with infection. So again, not surprising, but in line with some of the other data. Now, question two, not every respiratory symptom is related to H5N1. And so we've actually seen in other environments that there is several other viruses that could explain respiratory symptoms. So in this circumstance, though there was not serology done for other respiratory symptoms, that likelihood is that the illnesses that they that they experienced, were not caused by H5N1 based on our testing criteria. Over,\nDr. Nirav Shah - 19:13\nHey Josh, this is Nirav. One other point you noted, or you framed some of these results as asymptomatic, the structure of the survey itself doesn't demonstrate whether these individuals were asymptomatic or whether they just couldn't remember having had symptoms. And so the most we can say is that they can't remember having had symptoms. Some of them may have had mild symptoms that, again, were unmemorable. Some of them may have been indeed asymptomatic. The data that we have does not allow us to determine which of those it was, and so for that reason, we're not characterizing these as asymptomatic. All we can say is that they don't recall having had symptoms.\nOperator - 19:55\nOur next question comes from Erica Edwards.\nErica Edwards - 20:00\nHey, thanks so much. I appreciate the opportunity. And a couple questions. One is about the severity of H5N1 illness in people. I mean, obviously previous estimates from other areas of the world have quoted mortality rate of at least 50% I'm curious what you're learning about from studying the H5N1 infections here in the US that I think would be quite mild. What's different here? And then, if I also could ask, could you talk about any work that's being done to develop rapid tests, H5N1? Thank you.\nDr. Demetre C. Daskalakis - 20:32\nThanks for that question. So on, the severity, again, what we've been seeing in the United States is extremely mild symptoms. So again, ranging from moderate to mild conjunctivitis, and some people also experiencing mild respiratory symptoms, and also some with constitutional symptoms, like there have been some folks with beavers. So, you know, I think that there are a couple of hypotheses, which is all that we can really provide as to why there's a difference in severity. One, you know though, though H, all, H, 5n, ones are not built the same. So these are actually potentially different genotypes. So we know that there's sort of different clades and genotypes circulating. So what we have in the US at this point has only caused mild illness. Also, there could be issues related to the populations that are exposed to the virus, as well as to the magnitude of the exposure. So again, all hypotheses. So we don't have a very clear answer, but from the perspective of what we're seeing in the US, everything has been mild.\nDr. Nirav Shah - 21:40\nAnd then this is Nirav on your latter question around rapid tests. So CDC has been working very closely with our colleagues at NIH particularly their rad X program, to evaluate some of the rapid diagnostic tests that are already available on the market, to determine whether those tests are capable of detecting H5 These are tests that can already detect influenza A, influenza B, sometimes even COVID in general. But the question is, can they detect H5 the current circulating version of H5 as part of their overall diagnostic approach? And CDC has been collaborating with our NIH colleagues to try to understand the utility of those tests. We don't have a timeline on when those data will be available, but I know that work is underway right now. Separately, we've been working with diagnostics companies to determine what types of additional rapid tests might be useful in the marketplace to try to move or shorten the duration between becoming symptomatic or exposed and then being able to have access to testing. Clearly rapid test still an important niche there, so we're very much in favor of them. We've just got to make sure that they are capable of serving that purpose.\nDr. Demetre C. Daskalakis - 22:48\nJust one other thing to add is CDC will also be working with with a couple of states, to do a testing pilot where we're actually assessing a near point of care, or point of care test against lab based testing for H5, so that will also help elucidate some point of care strategies or or self-testing that may help in the future.\nOperator - 23:15\nOur next question comes from Washington Post.\nWashington Post - 23:21\nHi. Thanks for taking this call. Two questions. One, you mentioned one of the justifications for these precautionary measures being preventing onward spread, but we've also been hearing there's no evidence of human to human transmission. So does this new data create any concerns that some of these dairy workers may have been spreading the virus among each other, and then the second one is now that we have an incoming administration that's promised mass deportations. Are you worried about about a cooperation with these, investing with these investigate public health investigations in the future? Would you get the same kind of cooperation that you did with with workers, if there's a potential, if there's mass deportations looming, great\nDr. Nirav Shah - 24:07\nThis is Nirav as to the former question, I'm glad you raised that for avoidance of doubt and for clarity, there is nothing that we've seen in the new serology data that gives rise to a concern about person to person transmission. So to your point that you made about, why are we going this extra step with additional testing and Tamiflu to further in that regard? And the answer is to drive that risk down as low as possible. This is fundamentally a respiratory virus, and although we have not seen changes to the virus that would suggest the capacity for it to spread from person to person. We want to keep that risk as low as where it is right now, one of the best ways to do that is to identify individuals who have been exposed through greater testing and provide them with Tamiflu to drive down the levels of virus in their body, which, again. Helps us keep that low risk as low as possible. As to your latter question, we're not commenting on anything related to transition or an incoming administration. We're focused today on the serology data and the CDC actions therein. Thanks,\nModerator - 25:15\nCortney. We have time for two more questions, please.\nOperator - 25:19\nOur next question comes from Youri Benadjalud from ABC News.\nYouri Benadjalud from ABC News - 25:22\nThanks for taking my question. This data seems to support that there are a lot of cases that are potentially being undercounted, and there's only 46 confirmed by the CDC so far. How many cases in across forums, in the US, do you think that could actually be out there? And then I'll have a follow up, please.\nDr. Nirav Shah - 25:43\nThanks Yuri. Our data suggests that there in any outbreak situation, we know that there are individuals who may have been exposed, may have been infected, who are not part of the count. This is what serology data helps us get a better retrospective understanding of we still need more data to better characterize that so we can't speculate today on how many unidentified cases that there might be. We've always known that that's a possibility. What these data really help us understand is that some of those workers may have had such mild symptoms, such that they may not recall having been ill, and thus we need to identify those individuals and make sure they've got medication, as I said, in connection with the prior question, to drive their risk of getting ill as far as possible down, as well as to reduce the likelihood of spread. But better characterizing right now, how much of the iceberg is above the water versus below the water. It's not something we have enough data on quite yet.\nOperator - 26:43\nOur last question was from Kai Kuperschmid from Himes Magazine.\nKai Kuperschmid from Himes Magazine - 26:51\nThanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask a little bit about the timeline. Here you said the the samples were taken, I think June to August. It's November now, and just in general, I mean, it's taken a long time to get this kind of data. I know a lot of people have been waiting for it. Can you describe a little bit why it took this long, and what the hurdles are to do this, also to do it in other places, possibly. Thanks guys.\nDr. Demetre C. Daskalakis - 27:14\nSo I think a lot of the timeline is really around just sort of the standard procedures for serology for H5. So the first is again, we had to sort of gather the specimens. They had to come to CDC. And then the subsequent pieces are that these 115 specimens had to be run in our BSL, three labs that, as increasing data emerged, the cross reactivity with seasonal flu became something that we needed to be addressing in the testing. We then had to develop additional protocols to do the adsorption for seasonal flu, then run the absorption and then rerun the tests again. So this was released, really at a good time and a good timeline, given the complexity of non-routine laboratory testing that was needed to be able to characterize these individuals. Thanks for your question.\nModerator - 28:10\nI'd like to thank you all for joining us today. If we did not get to your question, or if you have follow up questions, please feel free to call the main CDC press office at 404-639-3286 or you can email media@cdc.gov Thank you for joining us, and this will conclude our call.\nThat concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."

    "content": "The number of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remains high in the United States, with more than 2.4 million reported in 2023. However, the latest data from CDC show signs the epidemic could be slowing. In 2023:\nGonorrhea cases dropped for a second year—declining 7% from 2022 and falling below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels (2019).\nOverall, syphilis cases increased by 1% after years of double-digit increases. Primary and secondary syphilis cases, the most infectious stages of syphilis, fell 10%—the first substantial decline in more than two decades. These cases also dropped 13% among gay and bisexual men for the first time since CDC began reporting national trends among this population in the mid-2000s. Increases in newborn syphilis (known as congenital syphilis ) cases appear to be slowing in some areas—with a 3% increase over 2022 nationally, compared to 30% annual increases in prior years .\nPrimary and secondary syphilis cases, the most infectious stages of syphilis, fell 10%—the first substantial decline in more than two decades.

We must make the most of this moment—let's further this momentum with creative innovation and further investment in STI prevention.\"\nInequities Persist\nWhile the STI epidemic touches nearly every community, some geographic areas and populations are affected more severely, including American Indian/Alaska Native, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino people, as well as gay and bisexual men. These health equity differences are due in part to deeply entrenched factors that create obstacles to quality health services, such as poverty, lack of health insurance, less access to health care, and stigma. Several federal efforts are underway to address these disparities. Action at the community level is also key to meaningful progress.\nThe new data follow important developments and innovations in STI prevention, such as CDC's guidelines for doxy PEP to prevent bacterial STIs; newly Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized self-tests (or at-home tests) for syphilis , gonorrhea, and chlamydia ; and a nationally coordinated response to the U.S. syphilis epidemic spearheaded by the National Syphilis and Congenital Syphilis Syndemic Task Force .\nHowever, more efforts are needed to turn around the STI epidemic in this country, including:\nPrioritizing the STI epidemic at federal, state, and local levels.\nDeveloping new prevention, testing, and treatment solutions for more populations – including expanding the reach of doxy PEP among groups for whom it is recommended, and conducting more research to determine if it can benefit other groups.\nInvesting in robust public health systems and trained workforces with capacity to provide STI services.\nDelivering STI testing and treatment in additional outreach settings, like emergency departments .\nMaking STI services more accessible in local communities ."

    "title": "Measles cases surge worldwide, infecting 10.3 million people in 2023",
    "date": "2025-08-19",
    "content": "14 November 2024 | Atlanta / Geneva – Worldwide, there were an estimated 10.3 million cases of measles in 2023, a 20% increase from 2022, according to new estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Inadequate immunization coverage globally is driving the surge in cases.\nMeasles is preventable with two doses of the measles vaccine; yet more than 22 million children missed their first dose of the measles vaccine in 2023. Globally, an estimated 83% of children received their first dose of measles vaccine last year, while only 74% received the recommended second dose.\nCoverage of 95% or greater of two doses of measles vaccine is needed in each country and community to prevent outbreaks and protect populations from one of the world's most contagious human viruses.\n\"Measles vaccine has saved more lives than any other vaccine in the past 50 years,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \"To save even more lives and stop this deadly virus from harming the most vulnerable, we must invest in immunization for every person, no matter where they live.\"\n\"The number of measles infections are rising around the globe, endangering lives and health,\" CDC Director Mandy Cohen said. \"The measles vaccine is our best protection against the virus, and we must continue to invest in efforts to increase access.\"\nAs a result of global gaps in vaccination coverage, 57 countries experienced large or disruptive measles outbreaks in 2023, affecting all regions except the Americas, and representing a nearly 60% increase from 36 countries in the previous year. The WHO African, Eastern Mediterranean, European, Southeast Asia and Western Pacific regions experienced a substantial upsurge in cases. Nearly half of all large or disruptive outbreaks occurred in the African region.\nAn unacceptable death toll due to rising measles cases\nThe new data show that an estimated 107,500 people, mostly children younger than 5 years of age, died due to measles in 2023. Although this is an 8% decrease from the previous year, far too many children are still dying from this preventable disease. This slight reduction in deaths was mainly because the surge in cases occurred in countries and regions where children with measles are less likely to die, due to better nutritional status and access to health services.\nEven when people survive measles, serious health effects can occur, some of which are lifelong. Infants and young children are at greatest risk of serious complications from the disease, which include blindness, pneumonia, and encephalitis (an infection causing brain swelling and potentially brain damage).\nAs measles cases surge and outbreaks increase, the world's elimination goal, as laid out in Immunization Agenda 2030, is under threat. Worldwide, 82 countries had achieved or maintained measles elimination at the end of 2023. Just this week, Brazil was reverified as having eliminated measles, making the WHO Americas Region once again free of endemic measles. With the exception of the African Region, at least 1 country in all WHO regions has eliminated the disease.\nUrgent and targeted efforts by countries and partners, particularly in the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions, and in fragile, conflict-affected, and vulnerable settings, are needed to vaccinate all children fully with two doses of measles vaccine. This requires achieving and maintaining high-performing routine immunization programmes and delivering high-quality, high-coverage campaigns when those programmes are not yet sufficient to protect every child.\nCountries and global immunization partners must also strengthen disease surveillance, including the Global Measles Rubella Laboratory Network (GMRLN). Strong disease surveillance is critical to optimizing immunization programmes and detecting and responding rapidly to measles outbreaks in order to mitigate their size and impact.\nNote to editors\nProgress Toward Regional Measles Elimination — Worldwide, 2000–2023 is a joint publication of WHO and CDC. It is published in the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record and in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. CDC and WHO use statistical modeling to estimate measles cases and deaths each year, based on cases reported by countries, and revise previous year's estimates to assess disease trends over time.\nCDC and WHO are founding members of the Measles & Rubella Partnership (M&RP), a global initiative to stop measles and rubella. Under the umbrella of Immunization Agenda 2030 and guided by the Measles and Rubella Strategic Framework 2030 , M&RP's mission includes addressing the decline in national vaccination coverage, hastening the recovery of the measles backsliding resulting from COVID-19 pandemic, and accelerating progress towards creating a world free of measles and rubella. The partnership also includes the American Red Cross , Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance , United Nations Foundation , and UNICEF .\nMeasles elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles virus transmission in a region or other defined geographical area for more than 12 months. Conversely, a country is no longer considered to be measles free if the virus returns and transmission is sustained continuously for more than a year.\nFor more information on CDC's global measles vaccination efforts, visit https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination .\nFor more information on WHO's measles response and support, visit https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles .\nRelated links\nProgress toward measles elimination – Worldwide, 2000-2023 https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7345a4.htm?s_cid=mm7345a4_w\nMedia contacts\nWHO: Mediainquiries@who.int\nCDC: Media@cdc.gov"

    "title": "California confirms first clade I mpox case",
    "date": "2025-08-21",
    "content": "CDC to receive samples for additional viral characterization.\nThe California Department of Public Health confirmed , through laboratory testing, the first known case of clade I mpox in the United States. This case is related to an ongoing outbreak of clade I mpox in Central and Eastern Africa. The risk of clade I mpox to the public remains low, and there continue to be sporadic clade II mpox cases in the United States.\nThe case was diagnosed in a person who recently traveled from Eastern Africa. The individual was treated shortly after returning to the United States at a local medical facility and released. Since then, the person has isolated at home, is not on treatment specific for mpox, and symptoms are improving. Based on their travel history and symptoms, patient specimens were tested and confirmed for the presence of clade I monkeypox virus. Specimens are being sent to CDC for additional viral characterization. Additionally, CDC is working with the state to identify and follow up with potential contacts.\nCasual contact, like you might have during travel, is unlikely to pose significant risks for transmission of mpox. While investigations continue into this case, CDC guidance has not changed. Protect yourself from mpox by:\nAvoiding close contact with people who are sick with symptoms of mpox, including those with skin or genital lesions\nAvoiding contact with contaminated materials used by people who are sick (such as clothing, bedding, toothbrushes, sex toys, or materials used in healthcare settings)\nAnd if you're eligible, get both recommended doses of mpox vaccine.\nThere are two types of mpox, clade I (with subclades Ia and Ib) and clade II (with subclades IIa and IIb; IIb caused the ongoing global outbreak ). You can't tell which type of mpox someone has by looking at them. Outbreaks from the different subclades can have different characteristics, like who they affect, how they're spread, or how many deaths they cause. Although clade II mpox has been circulating in the United States since 2022, clade I mpox has never been reported in the United States before now. Travel-associated cases of subclade Ib have been reported in Germany, India, Kenya, Sweden, Thailand, Zimbabwe, and the United Kingdom. Historically, clade I mpox has caused more severe illness and deaths than clade II mpox; however, recent data demonstrate that infections from clade I mpox in the current outbreak may not be as clinically severe as in previous outbreaks. While outbreaks of clade I mpox used to have death rates around 3%-11%, more recent outbreaks have had death rates as low as approximately 1% when patients received good medical oversight and supportive clinical care. Death rates are expected to be much lower in countries with stronger healthcare systems and treatment options, including the United States. Current data supports that subclade Ib has a lower death rate of < 1% both in and outside of Africa. The recent travel-associated clade I mpox cases outside of Africa have all been attributed to subclade Ib; there have been no deaths associated with these cases and available data for a subset has detailed relatively mild disease courses.\nPeople with mpox often get a rash that may be located on hands, feet, chest, face, mouth and/or near the genitals, including penis, testicles, labia, vagina, and anus. The incubation period is 3–17 days. During this time, a person does not have symptoms and may feel fine.\nThe anticipated overall risk of clade I mpox to the general population in the United States from the outbreak in Central and Eastern Africa is low. Earlier this year CDC conducted a risk assessment which included epidemiologic data from Central and Eastern Africa, data from the ongoing mpox outbreak in the United States caused by clade IIb, and historical data on clade I mpox outbreaks in DRC and other affected countries. In addition, CDC has simulated clade I mpox outbreaks . These simulations indicate that close-contact transmissions within and between households are unlikely to result in a large number of mpox clade I cases in the United States. Additionally, in Sweden, Thailand, Germany, and India there was no apparent onward spread of the virus and the onward spread in the United Kingdom has been limited to close, household contacts so far.\nCDC continues to work in Central and Eastern Africa to help stop mpox transmission at the source. This ongoing work includes laboratory training, supplies for diagnostic testing (including genetic sequencing), training of frontline health and epidemiologic workers, support for surveillance in people and animals, support for infection prevention and control, risk communication and community engagement, and direct technical assistance in outbreaks, as well as research collaborations.\nCDC has more than two years of experience responding to mpox in the United States due to the ongoing 2022 global clade II mpox outbreak and has adjusted existing domestic public health systems and structures to respond to any outbreak of clade I mpox in the United States. CDC issued guidance for travelers to countries in Central and Eastern Africa experiencing outbreaks earlier this year. CDC continues to recommend that clinicians request expedited clade specific testing for suspect clade I mpox cases with travel history to Central and Eastern Africa. CDC is also helping communities monitor the presence of both clades of mpox virus in wastewater samples. Data from samples can provide an early warning of mpox activity and spread in communities. CDC combines wastewater data with other data to decide if there is a need for further testing or other actions in collaboration with state and local public health partners.\nMore information on mpox is available online at Mpox | Mpox | CDC ."

    "date": "2025-03-03",
    "content": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed a human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) (H5N1 bird flu) in a child in California. This is the first reported avian influenza H5 virus infection in a child in the United States. Consistent with previously identified human cases in the United States, the child reportedly experienced mild symptoms and received flu antivirals. There were low levels of viral material detected in the initial specimen collected, and follow-up testing of the child several days later was negative for H5 bird flu but was positive for other common respiratory viruses. The child is recovering from their illness. An investigation by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) into the child's possible H5N1 exposure source is ongoing.\nDuring CDPH's investigation, all household members reported having symptoms and specimens were collected from those people. All test results from members of the household were negative for H5 bird flu, and some family members were positive for the same common respiratory viruses as the child. Contact tracing continues, but there is currently no evidence of person-to-person spread of H5N1 bird flu from this child to others. To date, there has been no person-to-person spread identified associated with any of the H5N1 bird flu cases reported in the United States.\nThis case was detected through influenza testing and reported to CDPH through influenza surveillance. This is the second U.S. case identified through national surveillance. CDC continues to closely monitor available data from influenza surveillance systems , particularly in states affected by outbreaks in animals, including California, where widespread outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu have been detected in wild birds and domestic poultry since 2022 and dairy herds since August 2024 in that state.\nLimited and sporadic human infections with avian influenza H5N1 virus, where animal exposure was not identified, are very uncommon but have occurred, primarily in countries other than the United States. These instances underscore the importance of ongoing surveillance and investigations at the local, state, and Federal levels. Including this most recent case, 55 human cases of H5 bird flu have now been reported in the United States during 2024, with 29 in California.\nCDC's risk assessment for the general public is low. However, people with exposure to infected or potentially infected animals, such as birds, dairy cattle, or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at higher risk of infection. CDC recommends avoiding unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals, including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals (including cows).\nCDC will continue to provide updates as additional information becomes available.

    "date": "2025-03-05",
    "content": "December 18, 2024 -- A patient has been hospitalized with a severe case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus (\"H5N1 bird flu\") infection in Louisiana. This marks the first instance of severe illness linked to the virus in the United States. The case was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday, December 13. Since April 2024, there have been a total of 61 reported human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States.\nPartial viral genome data of the H5N1 avian influenza virus that infected the patient in Louisiana indicates that the virus belongs to the D1.1 genotype related to other D1.1 viruses recently detected in wild birds and poultry in the United States and in recent human cases in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington state. This H5N1 bird flu genotype is different than the B3.13 genotype detected in dairy cows, sporadic human cases in multiple states, and some poultry outbreaks in the United States. Additional genomic sequencing and efforts to isolate virus from clinical specimens from the patient in Louisiana are underway at CDC.\nWhile an investigation into the source of the infection in Louisiana is ongoing, it has been determined that the patient had exposure to sick and dead birds in backyard flocks. This is the first case of H5N1 bird flu in the U.S. that has been linked to exposure to a backyard flock. A sporadic case of severe H5N1 bird flu illness in a person is not unexpected; avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection has previously been associated with severe human illness in other countries during 2024 and prior years, including illness resulting in death. No person-to-person spread of H5 bird flu has been detected. This case does not change CDC's overall assessment of the immediate risk to the public's health from H5N1 bird flu, which remains low.\nThis case underscores that, in addition to affected commercial poultry and dairy operations, wild birds and backyard flocks also can be a source of exposure. People with work or recreational exposures to infected animals are at higher risk of infection and should follow CDC's recommended precautions when around animals that are infected or potentially infected with H5N1 avian influenza virus. This means that backyard flock owners , hunters and other bird enthusiasts should also take precautions.\nThe best way to prevent H5 bird flu is to avoid exposure whenever possible. Infected birds shed avian influenza A viruses in their saliva, mucous, and feces. Other infected animals may shed avian influenza A viruses in respiratory secretions and other bodily fluids (e.g., in unpasteurized cow milk or 'raw milk').\nAs a general precaution, whenever possible, people should avoid contact with sick or dead animals, in particular wild birds, and poultry.\nFor individuals with direct/close contact with wild birds or sick or dead poultry or other animals, wear recommended personal protective equipment (PPE). Wild birds can be infected with avian influenza A viruses even if they don't look sick.\nDo not touch surfaces or materials (e.g., animal litter or bedding material) contaminated with saliva, mucous, or animal feces from wild or domestic birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected avian influenza A virus infection.\nFor more information on H5 bird flu in the U.S. and CDC's response, including regularly updated case counts, visit the H5 Bird Flu: Current Situation page ."

    "content": "January 6, 2025 -- CDC is saddened by Louisiana's report that a person previously hospitalized with severe avian influenza A(H5N1) illness (\"H5N1 bird flu\") has passed away. While tragic, a death from H5N1 bird flu in the United States is not unexpected because of the known potential for infection with these viruses to cause severe illness and death. As of January 6, 2025, there have been 66 confirmed human cases of H5N1 bird flu in the United States since 2024 and 67 since 2022. This is the first person in the United States who has died as a result of an H5 infection. Outside the United States, more than 950 cases of H5N1 bird flu have been reported to the World Health Organization ; about half of those have resulted in death.\nCDC has carefully studied the available information about the person who died in Louisiana and continues to assess that the risk to the general public remains low. Most importantly, no person-to-person transmission spread has been identified. As with the case in Louisiana, most H5 bird flu infections are related to animal-to-human exposures. Additionally, there are no concerning virologic changes actively spreading in wild birds, poultry, or cows that would raise the risk to human health. (CDC reported previously on its analysis of the viruses isolated from the patient in Louisiana .) However, people with job-related or recreational exposures to infected birds or other animals are at greater risk of infection. For these and others, CDC has developed prevention resources about how to protect yourself .\nCDC is continually:\nSupporting critical epidemiologic investigations with state and local partners to assess the public health impact of each H5 case.\nWorking closely with state and local partners to conduct active surveillance for H5 cases.\nMonitoring for changes that might suggest H5 viruses are becoming better adapted to mammals and therefore might spread more easily from animals-to-humans or human-to-human or cause more severe disease.\nMonitoring for any viral changes that could make these viruses less responsive to flu antiviral medications or the available candidate vaccine viruses.\nAdditional information about H5 bird flu is available on the CDC website ."

    "date": "2025-02-25",
    "content": "New provisional data from CDC's National Vital Statistics System predict a nearly 24% decline in drug overdose deaths in the United States for the 12 months ending in September 2024, compared to the previous year. This is the most recent national data available and shows a continued steep decline in overdose deaths. Provisional data shows about 87,000 drug overdose deaths from October 2023 to September 2024, down from around 114,000 the previous year. This is the fewest overdose deaths in any 12-month period since June 2020.\n\"It is unprecedented to see predicted overdose deaths drop by more than 27,000 over a single year,\" said Allison Arwady, MD, MPH, Director of CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. \"That's more than 70 lives saved every day. CDC's public health investments, our improved data and laboratory systems for overdose response, and our partnerships with public safety colleagues in every state mean that we are more rapidly identifying emerging drug threats and supporting public health prevention and response activities in communities across America.\"\nWhile this national decline is encouraging news, overdose remains the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18-44, highlighting the importance of sustained efforts to ensure this progress continues. President Trump first declared opioid overdose to be a public health emergency in 2017 , a designation that remains in place, and the subsequent public health investments to CDC from Congress have transformed the nation's ability to use data to save lives. In the most recent data, 45 states showed declines in overdose deaths, but five states—Alaska, Montana, Nevada, South Dakota, and Utah—still saw increases in overdose deaths, highlighting the continued need for rapid local data and tailored response. In addition to the large provisional drop in fatal overdoses, we also see smaller decreases in nonfatal overdoses, as measured by emergency department visits for overdose , and welcome continued decreases in self-reported youth substance use .\nMultiple factors contribute to the drop in overdose deaths, including widespread, data-driven distribution of naloxone, which is a life-saving medication that can reverse an overdose; better access to evidence-based treatment for substance use disorders; shifts in the illegal drug supply; a resumption of prevention and response after pandemic-related disruptions; and continued investments in prevention and response programs like CDC's flagship Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) program.\nCDC's OD2A program provides the United States with robust data through its fatal ( SUDORS ) and nonfatal ( DOSE ) overdose data systems. Currently, 49 state and 41 local health departments receive OD2A funding to collect, improve, and immediately use the data in their communities to implement life-saving activities. For example, the OD2A program funds comprehensive laboratory testing, which allows us to identify emerging substances involved in nonfatal and fatal overdoses and quickly highlight geographic shifts in the illegal drug supply. State and local public health departments, in partnership with CDC experts, use the data to inform where, what, and when overdose prevention efforts are needed in communities to have the greatest impact and save lives. Finally, CDC funds the Overdose Response Strategy, an innovative public health-public safety data collaboration in every state which allows public safety professionals like law enforcement officials to use data to better understand and intercept illegal drugs.\nWe are moving in the right direction, and we must accelerate and strengthen CDC's continued investments in prevention to reduce overdose deaths. Expanding access to evidence-based treatment for substance use disorders—including medications for opioid use disorder such as buprenorphine and methadone—is important, in addition to building more community-driven interventions and promoting education and early intervention to prevent substance use disorders before they begin.\nFor more information on CDC's overdose prevention efforts and data, visit: What CDC is Doing | Overdose Prevention | CDC"

    "content": "CDC continues to be in close communication with Texas health authorities about the measles outbreak in West Texas, following the death of a child. HHS sends its deepest condolences to the family. HHS is providing technical assistance, laboratory support, vaccines, and therapeutic medication as needed to the Texas Department of State Health Services and New Mexico Department of Health, which are leading the responses to the outbreaks in their jurisdictions.\nMeasles outbreaks are occurring globally, particularly in Asia, which means that there is an increased likelihood of cases among unvaccinated travelers returning to the U.S., which we saw in the February 19 case of an Orange County, California resident returning from Asia. Vaccination remains the best defense against measles infection. Measles does not have a specific antiviral treatment. Supportive care, including vitamin A administration under the direction of a physician, may be appropriate.\nHHS Secretary Kennedy has spoken directly to Governor Abbott, Commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services Dr. Jennifer A. Shuford, and other public health officials to express HHS' willingness to support local efforts in dealing with the outbreak."

Do not let children younger than 5 years old touch the birds (including chicks and ducklings) or anything in the area where the birds live and roam.\nWhat Businesses Should Do:\nHatcheries should use best management practices to help prevent Salmonella in poultry and stores should source poultry from hatcheries that take steps to reduce Salmonella contamination.\nClean and sanitize poultry display areas between shipments of new poultry.\nAbout Salmonella:\nMost people infected with Salmonella develop diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps 6 hours to 6 days after being exposed to the bacteria.\nThe illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment.\nIn some people, the illness may be so severe that the patient is hospitalized.\nChildren younger than 5, adults 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to have severe illness.\nIf you have questions about cases in a particular state, please call that state's health department.\nThank you,\nCDC News Media Branch\n404-639-3286\nmedia@cdc.gov"

    "date": "2025-05-14",
    "content": "Today's provisional data release from CDC's National Vital Statistics System shows a remarkable nearly 27% decrease in predicted drug overdose deaths in 2024 compared to 2023 on average, this decline suggests more than 81 lives saved every day.\nSince President Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency in 2017, Congressional support has enabled CDC to expand critical data systems and strengthen overdose prevention capacity across all states. These investments have empowered us to rapidly collect, analyze, and share actionable data—enabling communities to better understand the specific drivers of overdose in their area and tailor prevention strategies to meet their unique local needs. Since late 2023, overdose deaths have steadily declined each month—a strong sign that public health interventions are making a difference and having a meaningful impact.\nDespite these overall improvements, overdose remains the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18-44, underscoring the need for ongoing efforts to maintain this progress. Through sustained funding to support prevention and surveillance activities like the Overdose Data to Action program, we will continue moving toward a future in which Americans no longer lose their lives to drug overdoses.\nCDC remains steadfast in its commitment to preventing substance use disorders before they begin, expanding access to treatment, and strengthening recovery pathways to build a healthier future for all Americans."

The ACIP comprises leading medical and public health experts who advise the CDC on the safety, effectiveness, and clinical necessity of vaccines. The ACIP voted:\nTo approve, by a vote of five to two, one dose of clesrovimab, a monoclonal antibody for infants whose mothers are not protected by maternal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination. Clesrovimab is one of two RSV monoclonal antibody products available.\nTo approve, by a vote of seven to zero, the updated Vaccines for Children Program resolution for prevention of RSV.\nTo reaffirm recommendation, by a vote of six to zero, for routine annual influenza vaccination of all persons aged over six months who do not have contraindications.\nTo recommend, by a vote of five to one, for children 18 years and younger to receive seasonal influenza vaccines only in single-dose formulations that are free of thimerosal as a preservative.\nTo recommend, by a vote of five to one, that pregnant women receive seasonal influenza vaccines only in single-dose formulations that are free of thimerosal as a preservative.\nTo recommend, by a vote of five to one, that all adults receive seasonal influenza vaccines only in single-dose formulations that are free of thimerosal as a preservative.\nRecommendations made by the ACIP are reviewed by the CDC Director, and if adopted, are published as official CDC/HHS recommendations in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report . The CDC Director informs the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Assistant Secretary for Health of immunization recommendations.\nThe ACIP intends to hold its next meeting in the third quarter of 2025.\nThe members of the ACIP issued the following statement at the conclusion of today's meeting:\nHonesty, transparency, and compassion with regard to public health. These are the three pillars that we, the new ACIP members, are guided by. Our central duty is to protect public health, and we understand that we must answer the call for reestablishing confidence in the scientific examination process. This committee strongly supports the use of vaccines, and other countermeasures, predicated on evidence-based medicine, including rigorous evaluation and expansive, credible scientific data, for both safety and efficacy.\nAll stakeholders, including health care providers, parents, children, schools, nursing homes, insurance providers, public health agencies, manufacturers, and the rare few who may be harmed by recommended interventions, need to have understandable, digestible, scientifically correct information. This group is committed to providing that information, and in order to do so, we must have data representing large populations. Data collection is a central question that may require constructing a broad risk-benefit analysis. The committee will endeavor to assess the status of programs that are intended to collect data from large populations that have, or have not, received vaccines. These data are needed in order to assess both adverse short- and long-term side effects and to evaluate the magnitude of side effects.\nWe came to this meeting with no pre-determined ideas and will make judgements as if we are treating our own families. Unbiased scientific thinking is fundamental to the committee's charge. Our votes are recommendations, but we know that some may perceive them as mandates, so we take this responsibility very seriously. We pledge not to hold a vote if there is not sufficient information to enable evaluation of the risks and benefits.\nThis committee is not in competition with other committees, organizations, or each other – we are all in competition with the infectious diseases, and we will work together to ensure the best outcomes for public health."

    "content": "The back-to-school season is a great time to engage with youth about mental health and substance use to promote their well-being throughout the academic year. To support these conversations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has launched Free Mind , a new national campaign that provides youth ages 12-17 and their parents and caregivers with resources and information about substance use, mental health, and the connection between the two.\nThe drug overdose crisis is constantly evolving and remains an important public health issue. In 2024, more than 80,000 Americans died from a drug overdose. From 2020 to 2024, 75% of overdose deaths among youth ages 10–19 involved illegally made fentanyl. In addition, the number of teens reporting poor mental health has increased in the past decade. In 2023, 40% of high school students stopped regular activities because of persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness and one in five students seriously considered attempting suicide.\n\"Teens may use alcohol and other substances to help them cope with stress, anxiety, and depression,\" said Dr. Allison Arwady, Director of the CDC National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. \"Talking openly about mental health and substance use, and knowing when to get professional help, is critical to helping teens stay healthy. That's why this campaign supports youth, parents, and caregivers in having those conversations early, before an issue arises.\"\nCDC spoke directly with youth about their knowledge and perceptions regarding substance use to develop messages, branding, and tactical strategies for Free Mind . The campaign seeks to resonate with this age group by addressing the connections between substance use and mental health, risk factors that contribute to drug use, and strategies to keep them safe. CDC also has created resources for parents and caregivers about the latest substance use and mental health challenges youth may face.\nVisit Free Mind: Mental Health & Drug Use Awareness for Teens | CDC to learn more about the Free Mind campaign.

He offered his deepest condolences and reaffirmed the agency's commitment to honoring Officer Rose's bravery, sacrifice, and service to the nation.\nAs Secretary Kennedy stated in his X post , \"We are deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at CDC's Atlanta campus that took the life of officer David Rose. We stand with his wife and three children and the entire CDC family.\"\nHHS continues to support CDC personnel and their families. Most CDC personnel assigned to Roybal Campus are teleworking this week and additional safety and security measures are being put in place ahead of their return."
